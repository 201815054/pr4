0,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 20, 2016 06:22AM ET</span>",Gold / Silver / Copper futures - weekly outlook: November 21 - 25,"Investing.com - Gold prices fell to the lowest level since May on Friday as the dollar rallied to almost 14-year highs amid a rally driven by the U.S. presidential election and expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month.
Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange hit lows of $1,202.05 a troy ounce and settled down 0.74% at $1,207.9, the lowest close since June 3.
Gold prices were pressured lower as the dollar continued to surge following the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, tracking rising U.S. Treasury yields amid expectations that President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to ramp up fiscal spending and cut taxes will spur economic growth and inflation.
Faster growth would spark inflation, which in turn would prompt the Fed to tighten monetary policy a faster rate than had previously been expected.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 101.41 late Friday, its highest close since April 2003.
Gold is priced in dollars and becomes more expensive for holders of other currencies as the dollar rises.
The dollar rally has also been boosted by bets that the U.S. central bank will almost certainly raise interest rates next month.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday reiterated that a rate hike “could well become appropriate relatively soon.”
Investors have assigned a 95.4% chance of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting; according to federal funds futures tracked Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for December delivery settled down 1.32% at $16.55 a troy ounce, having fallen to its lowest level since June 8 at $16.43 earlier.
Elsewhere in metals trading, copper for December delivery settled at $2.46 a pound on the Comex.
In the week ahead, trade volumes are expected to remain light around Thursday's U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and Friday's shortened trading session.
The U.S. is set to release data on durable goods orders, jobless claims and new home sales ahead of the holiday, on Wednesday.

""We are receiving positive signals that increase the likelihood of agreement at the meeting ... and I'm optimistic about the situation,"" Zanganeh told state television by telephone, after meeting OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo in Tehran ahead of the Nov. 30 meeting.
""I think if we can reach an agreement, God willing, the price would rapidly reach above $50 per barrel ... If non-OPEC (producers) also cooperate, I don't think $55 per barrel would be out of reach."" 
Benchmark Brent crude rose by 37 cents to $46.86 per barrel on Friday. 
Asked about an OPEC proposal for an output cap of 3.92 million barrels per day for Iran, Zanganeh said: ""We have not reached any agreement. We have expressed our views and we look forward to explaining them.""
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is moving closer toward finalizing its first deal since 2008 to limit oil output, with most members prepared to offer Iran significant flexibility on production volumes, ministers and sources said on Friday. 
Iran has been the main stumbling block for such a deal because Tehran wants exemptions as it tries to regain oil market share after the easing of Western sanctions in January.

2,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2016 05:49PM ET</span>",Developer says Dakota Access pipeline will not be rerouted: AP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Energy Transfer Partners LP Chief Executive Officer Kelcy Warren said the company will not consider rerouting its Dakota Access oil pipeline despite concerns voiced by U.S. native groups, according to an Associated Press interview published on Friday.
President Barack Obama said earlier this month that the government was examining ways to reroute the pipeline.
Energy Transfer did not immediately respond to calls and emails seeking comment. Warren did tell the AP that he would like to meet with tribal leaders to ease their concerns about the project.
The Dakota Access Pipeline has been delayed since September, when federal regulators including the Army Corps of Engineers decided to re-review permitting under Lake Oahe, a federally owned parcel of land where the pipeline needs to cross.
The stoppage came after protests from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, whose reservation is adjacent to the federal land where the pipeline runs. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers elected to review their permitting again, and this past week deferred a decision, citing concerns about the tribe having been moved off its lands in the past.
On Friday, North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple asked the Army to resolve the permitting issues, citing protests that have sometimes turned violent at Cannon Ball, where the Standing Rock Sioux have erected a large camp that they plan to man throughout the winter. He also asked for assistance in law enforcement from federal authorities.
“Further delays simply prolong the risks to public safety, prolong the hardships endured by area residents and increase costs incurred by the state of North Dakota and Morton County,"" he said in a statement.
The 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline is expected to take oil from North Dakota's Bakken shale region to Patoka, Illinois, en route to the Gulf of Mexico.
Production in North Dakota has been declining, however, in part because of low oil prices and the crude there is more expensive to extract than other regions, and also because of the limited transport opportunities by pipeline.
Production in North Dakota fell to 972,000 barrels daily in September, lowest since February 2014, according to latest state data.
ETP crews have been moving equipment in recent weeks to the edges of Lake Oahe; the company has said it will begin tunneling under the lake once it is finished. It does not yet have the permit to do so, however.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday blocked new exploration for oil and gas in Arctic waters, in a win for environmental groups that had fought development of the ecologically fragile region.
The Department of the Interior released a 2017 to 2022 leasing plan that blocked drilling in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas off northern Alaska. It also limited petroleum development in the Cook Inlet off south-central Alaska. 
Environmental activists have battled drilling in Alaska to protect whales, walruses and seals, and as part of a broader movement to keep remaining fossil fuels in the ground.
The Interior Department said the plan was ""balanced,"" and left 70 percent of economically recoverable oil and gas resources open to drilling, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico.
The plan focuses on the best areas ""with the highest resource potential, lowest conflict and established infrastructure - and removes regions that are simply not right to lease,"" Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said. 
President Barack Obama, who last year became the first sitting president to cross the Arctic Circle, has made fighting climate change and protecting the Arctic priorities in his administration.
But President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican who takes office on Jan. 20, 2017, has vowed to open resources to petroleum development and could take steps to reverse the decision.
Oil interests have pressured the administration to explore for energy in the Arctic. Jack Girard, the head of the American Petroleum Institute industry group, said the decision ""puts the U.S. at a serious competitive disadvantage.""
Russia and Norway have also explored the Arctic, though   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) wound down drilling in the Russian north in 2014 due to U.S. sanctions over Moscow's aggression in eastern Ukraine.
Fierce winds and frigid waters make the Arctic treacherous for drilling equipment. After spending billions of dollars to explore the Alaskan Arctic, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) retreated in 2015 after suffering a gash in one of its ships and environmentalists had uncovered details of an old law that forced the company to cut exploration there by half. 
The U.S. Coast Guard complained when Shell was drilling off Alaska that it had been forced to divert resources, including a vessel that fought cocaine trafficking, to keep operations in the region safe. (http://reut.rs/2g4yHSW)
Environmentalists applauded the new lease plan, which built on a similar decision in March when the government removed much of the Atlantic ocean from oil and gas leasing for five years.
""This is excellent news for our oceans, from the Arctic to the Atlantic,"" said Jacqueline Savitz, deputy vice president for U.S. campaigns of Oceana, an international advocacy group.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2016 10:58AM ET</span>",Iraq's oil contracts make joining OPEC output cut more painful,"By Ahmad Ghaddar and Ahmed Rasheed
LONDON/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq would have to compensate international oil companies for limits placed on their production, according to industry sources and documents seen by Reuters, further reducing the prospect it will join any OPEC deal to curb the group's output.
The compensation - stipulated in contracts - would compound the financial hit of losing much-needed revenue from crude sales, if the cash-strapped country were to yield to OPEC entreaties to curtail national production.
OPEC member Iraq pays developers a fixed dollar-denominated fee for every barrel of oil produced in the south of the country - home to its biggest reserves - under technical service contracts agreed between the international firms and the state-owned South Oil Company (SOC).
""Immediately after (an) SOC notice of ... production curtailment, the parties shall agree ... a mechanism to promptly fully compensate (the) contractor as soon as possible,"" according to an excerpt of the contract the ministry signed with  BP  (LON:BP) in 2009 for the company to develop the 20-billion-barrel Rumaila field.
The compensation, according to the excerpt seen by Reuters, ""may include, amongst other things, a revised field production schedule or an extension to the term or payment of all or part lost income to contractor"".
Britain's BP declined to comment.
The same clause also applies to other fields covered by the technical service contracts in the south, including fields being developed by Anglo-Dutch firm Shell (LON:RDSa), U.S. major  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Italy's Eni, according to industry sources. 
A Shell spokeswoman said it did not comment on contracts. Exxon declined to comment and Eni did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
A senior oil official with SOC told Reuters the country would not have to worry about curtailment clauses because it had no plans to limit production. 
""On the contrary, we're encouraging the foreign companies to raise production as much as they can,"" said the official, who declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak publicly.
'EVERY DOLLAR NEEDED'
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed in Algiers in late September to limit its collective output to 32.5-33 million barrels per day (bpd). The group's production hit a record 33.64 million bpd in October. 
Iraq has asked to be exempted from output curbs, arguing it is still trying to regain market share lost when sanctions were imposed in the 1990s during the Saddam Hussein era, and that it needs to keep up a costly battle against Islamic State.
""OPEC must submit to the fact that Iraq must stay away from any possible output cut deal because the country is in the middle of a tough war and every single dollar is needed to keep it standing on its feet,"" a senior government official close to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told Reuters.
Iraq put its output at 4.77 million bpd in October and said it would not go back to below 4.7 million bpd.
""Not for OPEC, not for anybody else,"" said Falah al-Amri, Iraq's OPEC governor and head of the country's state marketer SOMO.
There is, however, no certainty over how the discussions will play out at an OPEC meeting on Nov. 30. 
As a consequence, the Iraqi oil ministry and oil companies will not be able to finalize their 2017 spending plans until after the meeting, to have enough clarity on what route Iraq will take on its near-term production ambitions, an industry source told Reuters. 
Iraq has been making great efforts to ensure it pays its dues to oil firms promptly and oil minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi has made boosting production in the country a priority. 
""[Iraq] is one of the countries in the region that doesn't have large foreign reserves, so will want to continue to maximize its revenue,"" said Jessica Brewer, Middle East upstream oil analyst at UK-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
She added that while most Middle Eastern OPEC members had all or most of their production operated by national oil companies, Iraq was one of the few that relied on international oil companies for the majority of its output.

5,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2016 10:57AM ET</span>",Can Trump make coal great again? At least some companies think so,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Most of the U.S. coal industry doubts Donald Trump can fulfill his promise to make the ailing industry great again in a country awash in dirt-cheap natural gas, a competing fuel. 
But a small sub-section of the coal sector that mines metallurgical coal - a variety used by steel makers instead of power plants - is gearing up for a Trump-inspired boom.
That’s because the Republican president-elect has promised a spending surge for roads, bridges and tunnels after he takes office on Jan. 20, a push to upgrade America's infrastructure with the support of leading Democrats that could jolt demand for metallurgical coal from American steel mills. Prices for met coal, as it is called, have already risen in recent months on lower supply from China.
""This is the best news that Appalachia as a whole has had in about 10 years,"" said Jason Bostic, a vice president at the West Virginia Coal Association, referring to Trump’s infrastructure agenda. ""Suddenly there’s a little bit of hope here.""
Corsa Coal Corp, a producer of met coal based in Pennsylvania, was already encouraged by the China-driven price spike before Trump’s victory. Now it believes U.S. politics are going its way too.
""The thing that has got me the most excited is the potential for infrastructure spending,"" said George Dethlefsen, Corsa's chief executive. ""All those things are very energy- and steel-intensive, and that's good for our business.""
The company plans to boost its production of met coal by 70 percent in 2017 to around 1.2 million short tons. In the meantime, it is putting mines on a six-day-a-week schedule, up from four days, and it is looking at loading coal on its midnight shift, which it normally reserves for maintenance.
Arch Coal Inc, which produces both met and steam coal used in power plants, said it was also optimistic about Trump, particularly his promise to roll back regulations. But other representatives of the steam coal industry have said regulation reversals may not overcome their main problem: plentiful and cheap natural gas following a decade-long hydraulic fracturing drilling boom.
National production figures for met coal are unavailable, since the government does not break the data out. But total U.S. coal production has fallen to its lowest level since 1986, costing the industry thousands of jobs, as low natural gas prices and President Barack Obama's emissions and water regulations took their toll.
Met coal prices, however, reflect the coal sector's only major sign of life this year. They have risen to above $270 a metric ton this month from lows of $70 a ton in February, driven in part by China reducing its output.
Corsa and Arch are among a very small number of U.S. met coal producers that are publicly traded, with most of the others small and privately owned. Alpha Natural Resources, which emerged from bankruptcy in July, declined to comment. 
INFRASTRUCTURE BANK
Trump's transition team is weighing an ""infrastructure bank"" to make investments in projects as part of an economic focus that also includes revamping taxes and regulation, a Trump adviser said this week.
Democrats, including Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, have indicated they hope to work quickly with Trump on infrastructure. But whether they will succeed is far from certain, as many Republicans oppose spending bills.
Ramaco, a private company, announced in September it will open two met coal mines in West Virginia and Virginia next year, thanks to $90 million in private equity investments that came in as global met coal prices swung upward.
Randy Atkins, the chairman and chief executive of Ramaco, said adding new mines was possible if Trump's U.S. infrastructure push succeeds but would depend on whether additional investors flock in to fund them.
Banks and financial institutions are sensitive to recent bankruptcies of major coal companies - including Arch and Peabody Energy Corp - and the weak financial conditions of others, Atkins said.
Jim Truman, the director of global metallurgical coal markets at research group Wood Mackenzie, said the specialized workers that would be required, such as underground electricians, could also be hard to find given coal's downturn since 2008.
Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America, said the other key to the U.S. met coal industry's outlook is whether new infrastructure relies on American-made steel and coal as Trump has promised.

""If we are importing the coal or importing steel made with foreign coal, then it won't make any difference for American miners,"" Smith said.

6,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2016 09:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Glencore seeks $550 million to raise stakes in Kurdish oil game,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) -  Glencore  is seeking to raise $550 million from investors via a debt issue guaranteed by oil from Iraqi Kurdistan in an attempt to secure a big slice of the high-risk - and high-reward - market in a region at war with Islamic State.
Kurdish oil has been targeted by European traders over the past two years, during an industry downturn, since Erbil began selling oil independently from Baghdad. It has been relatively cheap due to the potential for supply disruptions and threats from Iraq's central government to sue anyone touching the crude.
The government of the autonomous Kurdish region in Erbil has borrowed around $2 billion from Glencore's rivals such as Vitol, Petraco and Trafigura to be repaid in oil. The companies have all borrowed money from banks and lent it to Erbil at their own risk. 
Glencore (L:GLEN), whose commodity trading division has been under pressure to perform as mining profits have declined, was the last merchant to enter the game earlier this year by lending $300 million to Erbil. The loan is being repaid by way of one mid-sized oil cargo a month, worth around $25 million.
Now the company is seeking a much bigger role in the region, but wants to split the risks by selling debt notes to be repaid with Kurdish oil income, according to a prospectus seen by Reuters. 
Technically, the money would be raised by a special-purpose vehicle, says the document which has been sent to a small number of investors who specialize in high-risk markets.
It says Glencore expects to enter into a new 5-year agreement with the government of Kurdistan to buy its crude, with deliveries rising from one cargo in January, to two in February-March, four in April and six from May onwards.
Six cargoes a month would represent a quarter of overall exports from Kurdistan and would be worth over $1.7 billion a year at today's price of around $40 per barrel for Kurdish oil, and more than $8 billion over the course of five years.
Glencore declined to comment.
The risks of investments linked to Kurdish crude is reflected in the high returns offered in the debt issue.
Glencore's planned five-year note would carry an interest rate of 12 percent, according to the prospectus. That contrasts sharply with its other borrowings - it is currently buying back bonds carrying rates of 2.5 percent to 3.125 percent.
The company is also seeking a 36-month grace period before it starts repaying the debt in monthly installments, another reason why investors might expect a high return.
MILITANT ATTACKS
While Glencore and rivals have loaned money to Erbil, sources have previously told Reuters, they have never publicly acknowledged such deals for fears of confronting the Iraqi central government, which says the Kurds have failed to respect deals to transfer agreed volumes of oil to Baghdad.
Baghdad has softened its tone on Erbil in recent months as they wage a joint battle against Islamic State, but Iraqi state oil firm SOMO still occasionally threatens to sue buyers and sellers of Kurdish crude.
Kurdistan exports its oil via the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. Flows have been running at over 600,000 barrels per day since September after being occasionally disrupted in 2015 and at the start of this year due to militant attacks in Turkey and Kurdistan.
Glencore says in its prospectus that, at today's oil prices, the value of oil that it will receive under its new 5-year contract with Kurdistan will be over six times bigger than the $550 million debt issue.
But it also warns that disruption of deliveries ""may lead to deferral of monthly interest payments and principal"". It adds, however, ""that historical recovery track record for Glencore of these types of oil-backed facilities is exceptional"".
Glencore has been pre-financing oil exports from difficult places for decades since it was set up by the godfather of oil trading Marc Rich in the 1970s.
Such transactions do occasionally face setbacks like in the case of Moroccan refiner Samir, where several trading houses including Glencore lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year.
Glencore said it would hold a minimum of 10 percent of the notes at all times following the issue.
The move to secure larger volumes of oil from Kurdistan might put pressure on its rivals Vitol, Petraco and Trafigura which are renegotiating their contracts for 2017.

Vitol has so far been the largest buyer, with Petraco second and Trafigura and Glencore third and fourth respectively.

DOHA (Reuters) - OPEC is moving closer toward finalizing this month its first deal since 2008 to limit oil output, with most members prepared to offer Iran significant flexibility on production volumes, ministers and sources said on Friday.
Iran has been the main stumbling block for such a deal because Tehran wants exemptions as it tries to regain oil market share after the easing of Western sanctions in January.
Iran's rival Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has argued Iran's output has peaked and it should not be granted major concessions.
On Friday, several OPEC oil ministers including Saudi Arabia's Khalid al-Falih met in Doha on the sidelines of a gas forum. Iranian officials attended the gathering although minister Bijan Zanganeh did not come.
At the meeting, OPEC member countries proposed Iran cap its oil output at 3.92 million barrels per day (bpd), a source familiar with the proposal told Reuters.
Iran has previously said it would accept a freeze at between 4.0 and 4.2 million bpd.
Gulf OPEC sources have said they wanted Iran to cap output at around 3.6-3.7 million bpd - the volume the Islamic Republic is currently producing, according to OPEC estimates.
The source said Tehran had yet to respond to the proposal.
Iran's OPEC governor, who attended Friday's talks, said he was optimistic that the producer group would reach a deal when it gathers formally in Vienna on Nov. 30. 
Falih said the Friday meeting went well, but declined further comment.
If OPEC reaches a deal on Nov. 30, it may also draw support from non-OPEC members including Russia, which promised to cooperate but so far has refrained from any firm commitment.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak participated in Friday's meeting and said he thought OPEC was moving closer to a deal. If an agreement were reached, Russia was prepared to join and cap output for six months or longer, Novak said.

He also said more non-OPEC producers could join such a pact. The Azeri Energy Ministry said on Friday it would send a delegation to consultations in Vienna later this month.

9,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 18, 2016 06:54AM ET</span>",Crude prices edge higher amid OPEC deal hopes,"Investing.com - U.S. oil prices edged higher on Friday, as the prospect of a potential oil production freeze deal overshadowed the strength of the U.S. dollar.
U.S. crude futures for December delivery were up 0.24% at $45.53 a barrel.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the January Brent contract gained 0.37% to trade at $46.66 a barrel.
Crude prices found support after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Thursday that he was optimistic that OPEC would formalize a preliminary oil output deal reached in Algeria in September.
He said talks were ongoing with Qatar's Energy Minister Mohammed al-Sada, who had invited him to Qatar to continue discussions.
His comments came after Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday that Russia is ready to support OPEC's decision on an oil output freeze and sees big chances that the oil producers' group can agree on the terms of the freeze by November 30.
He also said there was a possibility he could meet Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih at a gas conference in Doha this week.
OPEC reached an agreement to cap output to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held in Algeria in late September. However, OPEC said it won’t finalize details on individual output quotas until its next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.
But the commodity’s gains were capped as the dollar remained broadly supported after strong U.S. initial jobless claims and inflation data on Thursday fueled further expectations for a rate hike at the Fed’s December policy meeting.
In addition, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in testimony to Congress that an increase in interest rates could be ""appropriate relatively soon"".

10,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2016 06:34AM ET</span>",Oil set for first weekly gain in five on OPEC deal optimism,"By Ahmad Ghaddar
LONDON (Reuters) - Brent crude oil prices were headed for their first weekly gain in five on Friday buoyed by renewed hopes that OPEC might agree production cuts, but a stronger U.S. dollar capped gains. 
Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) were flat at $46.49 per barrel at 1101 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures (CLc1) were down 7 cents at $45.35 a barrel and were on track for a their first weekly gain in four. 
OPEC member countries have proposed Iran cap its oil output at 3.92 million barrels per day (bpd) under a production-limiting deal for the whole group, a source familiar with the proposal has told Reuters. 
While Iran has not yet responded to the proposal, it means OPEC members may be coming nearer to a consensus on how much Iran should produce.
Iran has previously sent mixed signals, saying it would accept a freeze at between 4.0 and 4.2 million bpd.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday after meeting OPEC members he was more confident an output deal could be reached between Moscow and the group to help to boost oil prices.
Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said on Thursday he was optimistic about OPEC's deal to limit oil output and mentioned the lower end of a previously agreed production target of 32.5-33 million bpd.
But analysts said there were still obstacles for the producer group to overcome before it could reach a deal. OPEC is scheduled to meet next on Nov. 30. 
""Iranian and Iraqi intransigence to the proposed output cuts remains in full force while competitive pressures among OPEC members was highlighted by news that Iran displaced Saudi Arabia as the top oil supplier to India,"" Stephen Brennock of oil brokerage PVM said. 
Iran overtook Saudi Arabia as India's top oil supplier for the first time in October, shipping data showed.
Iraq would have to compensate international oil companies for limits placed on their production, further reducing the prospect it would join any OPEC deal to curb the group's output.
Jason Gammel of U.S. investment bank Jefferies said at least a 700,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) cut is needed to balance the market in the first quarter of 2017.
The rise in the U.S. dollar to its highest levels since 2003 against a basket of currencies on Friday weighed on oil prices. A stronger U.S. dollar makes oil, which is priced in dollars, more expensive to buyers using other currencies.
The U.S. dollar index (DXY) reached a 13-1/2-year high on comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen that a rate increase could happen ""relatively soon"", indicating higher chances of the rate hike in December.

11,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 18, 2016 03:04AM ET</span>",Gold hovers at 6-month lows on stronger dollar,"Investing.com - Gold prices were hovering at a six-month low on Friday, as a broadly stronger U.S. dollar continued to dampen demand for the precious metal.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for December delivery were down 1.01% at $1,204.50, the lowest since May.
The December contract ended Thursday’s session 0.57% lower at $1,216.90 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,199.00 and resistance at $1,231.00, Thursday’s high.
The greenback strengthened broadly after the U.S. Department of Labor said on Thursday that initial jobless claims fell by 19,000 last week to 235,000, the lowest level since 1973.
Separately, the Commerce Department said housing starts surged 25% in October to hit 1.323 million units, while building permits rose 0.3% to 1.229 million units.
 Data also showed that U.S. consumer prices rose 0.4% in October, in line with expectations. Year-over-year, consumer prices increased by 1.6% last month, its highest reading since October 2014.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.30% at a fresh 14-year peak of 101.30.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
The upbeat data added to optimism over the strength of the U.S. economy and also fueled further expectations for a rate hike at the Fed’s policy meeting next month.
Earlier Thursday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen warned Congress of the danger of waiting too long to tighten monetary policy and that a rate hike was likely ""relatively soon.""

16,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2016 02:00PM ET</span>",Trump pullout from climate deal would make odd couple with Nicaragua,"By Alister Doyle
MARRAKESH, Morocco (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threat of pulling the United States out of a global agreement to curb climate change could place the United States in a tiny club with just one other nation - Nicaragua.
If he acts on the threat, the two countries will be alone in formally opposing the Paris Agreement adopted by almost 200 other states - but for very different reasons.
Nicaragua was the only nation to reject the agreement last December. It has been arguing, at a meeting of almost 200 nations in Marrakesh, for far more drastic action to limit rising temperatures.
By contrast, Trump has called the very concept of man-made global warming a hoax and has said he will withdraw from the agreement, instead wanting to bolster the U.S. coal, oil and shale industries.
""Paris was not successful. It was a failure,"" Nicaragua's chief delegate Paul Oquist told Reuters in Marrakesh. ""The world needs urgent action now.""
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, who won re-election this month, has often been at odds with the United States. He was in power in the 1980s when former U.S. president Ronald Reagan funded right-wing rebels in a failed bid to topple his government.
U.S. climate envoy Jonathan Pershing, asked about the possibility that the United States would be in a group with Nicaragua, said it was too early to speculate about Trump's policies.
""We do not believe that the United States would have it in its interests not to be a party to this (agreement),"" he said. ""We believe it's deeply in our interest.""
Oquist said the Paris Agreement, built from government promises for national actions, was far too weak to achieve its core goal of limiting a rise in temperature to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.
He said rich countries should take on legally binding cuts in emissions to limit warming that could undermine farming such as coffee in Nicaragua, spread floods and droughts and raise sea levels. He said Nicaragua was doing its own fair share by shifting to renewable energies.

Dozens of nations have reiterated support for the Paris Agreement since Trump's victory, but there are worries that it might drain support for the Paris Agreement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday, with U.S. crude briefly rising as much as $1 a barrel, as expectations of an OPEC deal to limit production outweighed oversupply concerns, but a rallying dollar capped gains. 
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he was optimistic the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would formalize a preliminary oil output deal reached in Algeria in September.
""I'm still optimistic that the consensus reached in Algeria for capping production will translate, God willing, into caps on states' levels and fair and balanced cuts among countries,"" he told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya TV.
Falih said he believed the market was on its way to becoming balanced and that an agreement by OPEC at its meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30 would speed the recovery.
OPEC members are ready to reach a ""forceful"" agreement, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on Wednesday, following a meeting with OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo, who described the situation as the most severe oil market crisis in 50 years.
Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was up 23 cents a barrel at $46.86 by 11:53 a.m. ET after retreating from a high of $47.62. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) was also up 32 cents at $45.89. It reached a session high of $46.58. 
The dollar (DXY) rose after strong U.S. economic data and comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen further bolstered the case for hiking rates next month. [USD/]
""Two things the market is looking at: they're looking at the OPEC news, and they're looking at Janet Yellen,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""Right now with the dollar turning positive, I think that's where we pull back."" 
A stronger dollar makes the greenback-denominated crude more expensive for holders of other currencies, compounding bearish sentiments from evidence of oversupply.
The market was also still under pressure from U.S. Energy Information Administration data on Wednesday that showed a larger-than-expected crude build of 5.3 million barrels in the week to Nov. 11.[EIA/S]
Stockpiles at the U.S. delivery hub for crude futures in Cushing, Oklahoma, which the EIA said increased nearly 700,00 barrels last week, rose 303,001 barrels in the week to Nov. 15, according to traders, citing energy monitoring service Genscape.
Crude inventories were also rising elsewhere, thanks to record output by OPEC, which pumps around 40 percent of world oil supply.
""The name of the game is 'volatility' as confusing signals are arriving before OPEC meets,"" said Tamas Varga, senior analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.

""We have evidence of oversupply - U.S. stocks rising - versus hopes for some action by OPEC.""

Natural gas for delivery in December on the New York Mercantile Exchange tumbled 4.6 cents, or 1.7%, to $2.716 per million British thermal units by 10:33AM ET (15:33GMT). Futures were at around $2.740 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 30 billion cubic feet  in the week ended November 11, just below market expectations for an increase of 31 billion cubic feet.
That compared with a gain of 54 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 15 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 3 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 4.047 trillion cubic feet, 1.3% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 5.3% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market analysts have warned that supplies in storage could peak at around 4.050 trillion cubic feet by the end of November unless subfreezing winter temperatures result in higher demand.
Updated forecasting models showed a weather system pushing into the western U.S. later this week, which will then track toward the eastern U.S. next weekend, bringing rain, snow, and cooler than normal temperatures along with it.
Natural gas prices typically rise ahead of the winter as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand.

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is due to testify on the economic outlook before the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee on Thursday at 10:00AM ET (15:00GMT).
Her comments will be monitored closely for any new insight on policy. The Fed left interest rates unchanged earlier this month, in a widely expected decision, but signaled it could hike in December as the economy gathers momentum and inflation picks up.
Besides Yellen, there is important data Thursday. CPI, housing starts, the Philly Fed survey and weekly jobless claims are all due at 8:30AM ET (13:30GMT).
Investors are currently pricing an 86% chance of a rate hike at the Fed's December 13-14 meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
The greenback hovered close to the prior session's 14-year high against a basket of major currencies early on Thursday, supported by expectations of higher interest rates in the coming months.
The dollar index was recently at 100.33, after climbing to 100.59 the day before, a level not seen since April 2003.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Meanwhile, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury was down 2.5 basis points at 2.198% in early trade, pulling back from a 10-month high of 2.302% set earlier in the week.
Market analysts warned that the outlook for gold remains cloudy in the near-term. Prices of the yellow metal are down more than 6% over the past week amid optimism that increased U.S. fiscal spending and tax cuts under a Trump administration will spur economic growth and inflation, which would ultimately lead to an era of higher interest rates.

LONDON (Reuters) - Commodities-related revenue at the 12 biggest investment banks fell 22 percent in the first nine months due to weak industrial metals trading and lackluster investor interest, a report by financial industry analytics firm Coalition said.
Revenue from commodity trading, selling derivatives to investors and other activities in the sector slid to $3.1 billion between January to September from $4 billion in the same period in 2015, the report published on Thursday found.
In 2015, the banks' commodities revenue dropped 18 percent, mainly due to slow business in metals and investor products, and also reflecting a return to more normal turnover in the power and gas markets after the previous year's surge.
Coalition's report highlighted oil's weakness and poor trading results as well as a ""decline in investor products despite the anticipation of increased client activity in 2H16.""
Oil and base metals prices have been volatile, slumping to multi-year lows before rebounding. U.S. oil prices (CLc1) crashed below $27 a barrel on Jan. 20 for the first time since 2003 but ended the third quarter at $48.

Trump has called global climate change a hoax and has pledged to walk away from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which was strongly supported by outgoing Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama. Trump has also promised to roll back some of America's environmental policies, which he said would revive the ailing U.S. oil and coal industries. 
""Trump administration's energy policy direction contrasts with that of the Obama administration, therefore, substantial changes in domestic and global energy markets are inevitable,"" Vice Energy Minister Woo Tae-hee said, according to a copy of a speech he was to deliver at an industry forum in Seoul. 
""As a result, uncertainty of energy policy is increasing greatly,"" Woo said. 
To minimize the impact of U.S. energy policy changes, Woo urged Korean private companies to look for more opportunities to participate in U.S. exploration projects as U.S. shale gas production is expected to rise. 
Woo also suggested that South Korea should expand other cooperation in the oil and gas sector, citing as an example Korea Gas Corp's (KS:036460) long-term shale gas supply deal with U.S. Cheniere Energy (A:LNG). 
The two companies signed a 20-year deal in 2012, and KOGAS is set to start next year to bring 2.8 million tonnes per annum of liquefied natural gas processed by Cheniere to South Korea. 
In the renewable energy sector, which is likely to be hit hard by U.S. policy changes, the vice minister said South Korea should bolster cooperation with the U.S. in clean energy fields, including solar power, despite worries over slow market growth. 
South Korea unveiled an investment plan worth about $37 billion in early July this year to grow renewable energy and related businesses by 2020 with an aim to cut greenhouse emissions and improve the economy.

That followed a near 6 percent price surge on Tuesday on news the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would renew efforts to limit production ahead of its official meeting in Vienna.
Russia said it was ready to support OPEC's decision on an output freeze and sees big chances that the oil producers' group can agree on the terms of the freeze by Nov. 30, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said.

Those informal meetings could include energy ministers from Saudi Arabia and Russia. But Iran's oil minister will not be attending, sending the country's OPEC governor instead, sources said.
""We see enough cooperation between these two oil power houses to keep a significant amount of OPEC premium embedded in the market,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors who sent copper to a 17-month peak on hopes for a splurge of U.S. infrastructure spending by Donald Trump may end up underwhelmed given that the plans, even if successful, would add only modestly to world demand.
China dominates the global copper market, accounting for half of all demand, and an uptick in consumption there following further stimulus is much more relevant to the market.
That, together with less mine supply than expected, would support slightly firmer prices, but not the wild frenzy that erupted after the U.S. election last week, investors and analysts said.
""The infrastructure ambitions of Trump I think are meaningless in terms of the course and direction of commodities,"" said Scottish hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry, founder and chief investment officer of Eclectica Asset Management, which has around $200 million under management.
Copper prices soared about 25 percent from the start of the month to a peak of $6,025 a ton last Friday, but have since retreated to $5,466 by Wednesday - still nearly a fifth higher since the start of 2016.
Experts brush off the impact on copper of plans by the incoming U.S. president to spend $1 trillion over 10 years on building infrastructure, even as they are more upbeat on the plan's impact on the U.S. steel sector.
Unlike copper, steel prices are set regionally, and an infrastructure spending spree coupled with even stronger trade protectionism would initially be a big boost for the U.S. steel market, even though longer term the fear is that steel price inflation will cripple demand growth.
U.S. COPPER DEMAND SLIDES
Copper consumption in the United States has slid 40 percent over the past 15 years to 1.8 million tonnes last year, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
That compares to 10 million in China, Thomson Reuters GFMS data shows.
""Even an assumed 10 percent increase in infrastructure-related copper consumption would hardly matter on a global scale,"" said analyst Carsten Menke at Julius Baer in Switzerland.
""This is not least due to the fact that part of the increase in copper demand would be met by increasing recycling, considering that existing infrastructure would be replaced rather than expanded.""
A position paper by Trump's advisors about his infrastructure plans published before the election did not mention specific projects, but referred to the broad sweep of possibilities including bridges, airports and digital superhighways.
""Even if Trump’s infrastructure plan goes ahead, the impact on physical markets is likely to be only modest,"" said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""If spending goes toward building roads and bridges, this wouldn’t be as beneficial for metals demand as extra spending on sectors such as power, transportation and capital infrastructure projects,"" Bhar said in a note.
More important is whether stronger demand in China on the back of stimulus earlier this year persists.
China's real estate sector is a prime driver of demand for industrial metals including copper, but investment has slowed and builders started fewer new homes year-on-year in September, the first such decline since December.
""These are lead indicators for copper demand by six to 12 months, but have clearly turned sharply negative,"" Liberum analyst Richard Knights said in a note.
Hendry, although dismissing the impact of infrastructure spending on commodities, says a wider fiscal stimulus could boost overall economic growth and give the sector a lift.
""A trillion plus tax cuts are not (meaningless) and would certainly seem to be the first dramatic and politically supported step,"" he told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit.
""That's a world where commodities, you have to imagine, retain their outperformance.""

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. shale oil producers will increase their output if oil prices hit $60 a barrel, meaning OPEC will have to walk a fine line if it curtails production to prop up prices, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.
OPEC members are due to meet in Vienna at the end of the month to push through the first output limiting deal since 2008.
""If this decision pushes the prices up (to) around $60 dollars, we may well see a significant increase from shale oil from the U.S.,"" Fatih Birol told Reuters on Wednesday.
He said this level would be enough for many U.S. shale companies to restart stalled production, although it would take around nine months for the new supply to reach the market.
Low prices have led to two consecutive years of falling investment in upstream oil and gas investments, a pattern Birol expects to continue in 2017.
This, he said, could lead to tighter oil supply and price spikes in the future.

""We are entering a period of greater oil price volatility and the companies, organizations and countries should prepare themselves accordingly,"" he said.

(Reuters) - U.S. crude oil inventories rose more than expected last week on increased imports and a build at the storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed on Wednesday.
Crude inventories  rose for the third consecutive week, increasing 5.3 million barrels in week ended Nov. 11, compared with expectations for an increase of 1.5 million barrels. 
The price of oil was higher on the day. U.S. crude futures (CLc1) initially dipped on the inventory rise, but subsequent headlines from Russia's energy minister suggesting major oil-producing nations hope to reach balance in the market in a shorter time frame reversed those losses.
U.S. crude was up 29 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $46.11 a barrel, while Brent crude rose 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $47.21 a barrel, as of 10:51 a.m. EST (1551 GMT).
""This (build) is larger than expected but not enough to offset the anticipation of OPEC and some of the macro things that are going on around the world,"" said Scott Shelton, energy specialist at ICAP (LON:IAP) in Durham, North Carolina.
""I would not be surprised if the market ignores this and we end up higher on the day."" 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet at the end of the month, where it is expected to cap oil production to offset an ongoing supply glut.
U.S. crude imports  rose last week by 910,000 barrels per day. Heavy imports contributed to a 4.9 million-barrel increase in stocks in the U.S. Gulf, the country's refining hub.
Stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures  rose 691,000 barrels, EIA said.
The build came even as refinery crude runs  rose by 309,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed, and refinery utilization rates  rose 2.1 percentage points.
Gasoline stocks  rose 746,000 barrels, compared with expectations for a 416,000-barrel drop.

Distillate stockpiles , which include diesel and heating oil, increased 310,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 1.7 million-barrel decline, the EIA said.

Crude oil for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was down 63 cents, or 1.38%, at $45.18 a barrel by 10:33AM ET (15:33GMT). Prices were at around $45.38 prior to the release of the inventory data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 5.3 million barrels in the week ended November 11. Market analysts' expected a crude-stock gain of 1.5 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply increase of 3.7 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, increased by 691,000 barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 490.3 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 0.7 million barrels, compared to expectations for a decline of 0.4 million barrels.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a gain of 0.3 million barrels.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for January delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London shed 54 cents, or 1.15%, to $46.41 a barrel.
Oil traders continued to weigh prospects of a coordinated production cut among major global oil producers.
An informal meeting of OPEC members is likely to be convened in the Qatari capital, Doha, on Friday to build consensus over decisions taken by the group in September, an Algerian energy source said on Wednesday.
Prices rallied nearly 6% on Tuesday amid reports that several OPEC members were engaged in a last-minute push to overcome divisions between the cartel’s biggest producers.
The oil group reached an agreement to cap output to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held in Algeria in late September. However, OPEC said it won’t finalize details on individual output quotas until its next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.
The cartel pumped 33.64 million barrels of crude per day in October. The figures added to skepticism over the implementation of a planned deal by OPEC to limit production.
The possibility that producers could walk away empty-handed from the November meeting looms large after Iraq, Iran, Nigeria and Libya all signaled they might not take part in the proposed production cut deal. Russia’s unclear stance is also fueling uncertainty.

Natural gas for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 6.0 cents, or 2.2%, to $2.766 per million British thermal units by 9:02AM ET (14:02GMT). It lost 4.0 cents, or 1.46%, the day before.
Market participants awaited weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 21 and 30 billion cubic feet in the week ended November 11.
That compares with a gain of 54 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 15 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 3 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at an all-time high of 4.017 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 1.2% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 4.7% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market analysts have warned that supplies in storage could peak at around 4.050 trillion cubic feet by the end of November unless subfreezing winter temperatures result in higher demand.
Updated forecasting models showed a weather system pushing into the western U.S. later this week, which will then track toward the eastern U.S. next weekend, bringing rain, snow, and cooler than normal temperatures along with it.
Natural gas prices typically rise ahead of the winter as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand.

LONDON/DOHA (Reuters) - OPEC officials are working to nail down details of their plan to limit oil supply and gaps over some sticking points are narrowing, OPEC sources said, a sign of progress in finalizing the exporter group's first such deal since 2008.
OPEC agreed in Algeria on Sept. 28 to limit supply with special conditions given to Libya, Nigeria and Iran, whose output has been hit by wars and sanctions. The details are meant to be finalised when OPEC ministers meet in Vienna on Nov. 30.
With two weeks to go, differences persist over details and the prospect of a supply glut persisting in 2017 has weighed on oil prices (LCOc1), which are below $47 a barrel. Crude reached a 2016 high near $54 after the September deal.
Two sources familiar with discussions said efforts were under way to narrow gaps and a final agreement would be reached.
""It is difficult at some points but I don't see any deadlock,"" one of the sources said. ""What happened in Algeria gave a lot of hope and impetus and I think people are committed to that.""
One issue has been the level of production at which Iran would be expected to freeze its output.
Sources say Iran wants an output cap of 4 million barrels per day, while other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries want Iran to freeze supply at about 3.7 million bpd.
This issue, several OPEC sources told Reuters, was a source of tension at an Oct. 28 meeting in Vienna of the High Level Committee, a panel looking at how to divide the Algeria agreement into individual supply limits.
Other OPEC members are willing to be more flexible on this, two sources said. One of them said while meeting Iran's demand for 4 million bpd was unlikely, Tehran would probably be offered a figure of 3.75 million bpd or higher.
""Whatever it takes to reach a consensus will be taken by the ministers,"" said a third OPEC source familiar with discussions, referring to finding a compromise over Iran. ""We cannot leave Vienna on November the 30th without an agreement.""
The High Level Committee meets for a second time in Vienna on Monday, and a number of OPEC ministers are likely to hold talks informally in Doha on Friday on the sidelines of a gas conference.
In a further effort to forge consensus, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo is visiting more OPEC members in the next few days. He is scheduled to meet Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro later on Wednesday, and he then travels to Ecuador and Iran, a source said.
Barkindo said on Nov. 7 that OPEC was committed to implementing the deal.

In a statement addressed to Trump, U.S. President Barack Obama, members of the U.S. Congress and global leaders, the group, called 360+, reaffirmed its commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change.
The 360+ group includes companies such as DuPont (NYSE:DD), Gap ,  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) , Hewlett Packard , Hilton , Kellogg, Levi Strauss & Co., L'Oreal USA,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) , Mars Incorporated, Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) .
The Paris Agreement, aiming to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions this century, came into force on Nov. 4 and now has backing from 110 nations including the United States.
The Nov. 7-18 meeting in Marrakesh is where U.N. officials and government representatives are trying to work out the details of the pact. However, Trump's victory in the U.S. election last week has overshadowed the event.
Trump has threatened to tear up the U.S. commitment to the accord.

Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on $3.10, or 0.25%, to $1,227.60 a troy ounce by 3:50AM ET (08:50GMT). It posted a modest gain of 0.2% the day before.
Market analysts warned that the outlook for gold remains cloudy in the near-term. Prices of the yellow metal are down more than 6% over the past week amid optimism that increased fiscal spending and tax cuts under a Trump administration will spur economic growth and inflation, which would ultimately lead to an era of higher interest rates.
Investors are currently pricing a 90.6% chance of a rate hike at the Fed's December 13-14 meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
The greenback hovered close to an 11-month high against a basket of major currencies early on Wednesday, supported by expectations of rising rates.
The dollar index was recently up 0.1% at 100.29, after climbing to 100.34 earlier, the most since December 2015. If it rises above 100.51, it would reach its highest level since April 2003.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Meanwhile, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note was up 2.2 basis points at 2.260% in early trade, within sight of a 10-month high of 2.302% set earlier in the week.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2016 03:50AM ET</span>","Oil demand won't peak before 2040, despite Paris deal: IEA","By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - The International Energy Agency expects global oil consumption to peak no sooner than 2040, leaving its long-term forecasts for supply and demand unchanged despite the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement entering into force.
The Paris accord to cut harmful emissions seeks to wean the world economy off fossil fuels in the second half of the century in an effort to limit the rise in average world temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.
But while demand for oil to power passenger cars, for example, may drop, other sectors may offset this fall.
""The difficulty of finding alternatives to oil in road freight, aviation and petrochemicals means that, up to 2040, the growth in these three sectors alone is greater than the growth in global oil demand,"" the IEA said in its annual World Energy Outlook.
From 2020, the European Union will impose much tougher legislation to control vehicle emissions, which many expect to quickly erode use of traditional fuels such as gasoline and diesel, a major source of oil demand.
In the report, the IEA looks at three scenarios for oil supply and demand. Its central, or ""New Policies"", scenario assumes signatory countries will attempt to meet the requirements set by Paris, as well as existing environmental legislation, while its ""450 scenario"" assumes signatories will adhere to the agreement and oil demand will fall off sharply and the ""current policies"" scenario does not factor in the Paris deal.
The IEA's central scenario assumes demand will reach 103.5 million barrels per day by 2040 from 92.5 million bpd in 2015, for which India will be the leading source of demand growth and China will overtake the United States to become the single largest oil-consuming nation.
Overall, under the New Policies scenario, the IEA said it sees non-OECD oil demand growth running at the slowest pace for more than 20 years, but this would still be enough to offset a continued fall in OECD country demand, which will be tempered by policies aimed at improving vehicle fuel efficiency.
""In the New Policies Scenario, balancing supply and demand requires an oil price approaching $80 a barrel in 2020 and further gradual increases thereafter,"" the IEA said, leaving its price forecast under this scenario unchanged from last year's World Energy Outlook.
DROP-OFF IN DEMAND
The IEA's ""450 scenario"" forecasts rising use of electric vehicles and consumption of biofuels that will cut oil demand.
""In the 450 Scenario, global oil demand peaks by 2020, at just over 93 million bpd. The subsequent decline in demand accelerates year-on-year, so that by the late 2020s global demand is falling by over 1 million bpd every year,"" the IEA said.
""Oil use in passenger vehicles in the 450 Scenario falls from just under 24 million bpd to 15 million bpd in 2040, nearly 10 million bpd lower than the 2040 level in the New Policies Scenario,"" the agency said.
Without factoring in implementation of the Paris Agreement and only assuming the measures adopted by mid-2016 will apply, the IEA's ""current policies"" scenario forecasts a rise in demand to 117 million bpd by 2040.
On the supply side, in both the New Policies and 450 scenarios, the IEA expects the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain its strategy of controlling output in order to support prices.
It sees a gradual decline in OPEC production out to 2040, when it expects the group's output to be around 10 percent lower than its current level of 33.8 million bpd, but says this drop will be much slower than the decline in non-OPEC production, which it expects to fall by nearly a third in this time.
In the New Policies scenario, global oil output is expected to rise to around 100.5 million bpd by 2040, from 2015's 92.5 million bpd, while under the 450 scenario, supply is expected to fall to around 71 million bpd.
In its Current Policies outlook, the IEA estimates global supply will rise to 113.6 million bpd by 2040.

""OPEC provides an increasing share, approaching 50 percent of global production by 2040 – a level not seen since the 1970s – while unconventional production more than doubles between 2015 and 2040,"" the agency said.

LONDON/NEW DELHI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - A multi-billion-dollar Russian deal to buy Indian refiner Essar was nearly sunk at the eleventh hour by a rival bid from Saudi Arabia as the two oil superpowers vie for supremacy across the world.
The deal between Essar and a consortium led by Kremlin oil giant Rosneft (MM:ROSN) appeared dead in the water two months ago after Saudi state energy firm Aramco weighed in, according to seven Russia, India and Saudi-based industry sources familiar with or involved in the negotiations.
It was salvaged due to the involvement of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who were keen for it go through, and after the consortium agreed to pay $13 billion - more than double what Rosneft had initially valued Essar at, sources told Reuters. 
This made the refiner the biggest-ever foreign acquisition in India and Russia's largest outbound deal. 
The tussle for Essar - a state-of-the-art plant in the world's fastest-growing fuel market - illustrates the growing battle for oil markets between Russia and Saudi Arabia, the world's two largest crude exporters.
It also sheds light on the challenges OPEC member Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Russia - which are also fighting a proxy conflict in Syria's civil war - will face in trying to clinch a global agreement to limit output growth to prop up oil prices. 
The full details of how the Essar deal was struck remain unclear. Two industry sources said it was rescued thanks to the involvement of Putin and Modi while three other sources said Rosneft had simply outbid Saudi Aramco. 
Officials in Modi's office declined to comment while Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied there was any Kremlin intervention in the deal. 
""Naturally, we defend the interests of our companies. Of course we lobby for them, especially on such large deals,"" said Peskov, but added that in the case of Essar ""there were no orders from the Kremlin"". 
""It was a corporate decision by Rosneft to gain synergies via cooperation with India,"" he said. 
Rosneft and Saudi Aramco declined to comment. 
Essar said it had held discussions with several potential buyers but had gone with the Rosneft consortium because their offer was considered the most attractive. It denied there was any intervention from Putin or Modi.
SHOWDOWN
Rosneft boss Igor Sechin is keen to buy refining assets around the world to guarantee outlets for Russian oil. He had been negotiating since 2014 to buy 49 percent of Essar from its owners, Indian brothers Ravi and Shashi Ruia, and the two parties had been in exclusive talks since July 2015 when a preliminary deal was signed. 
While the exact amount Rosneft was prepared to offer for the stake at that stage is unclear, Russian and Indian industry sources said it valued the whole of Essar at about $5.7 billion. 
However it became apparent that there were problems with the deal in early September, when Sechin traveled to India to meet the Ruia brothers, flying from Hangzhou, China, where he had been part of Putin's G20 summit delegation.
Sechin walked into the meeting with the Ruia brothers soon after landing in India at 1 a.m., determined to close the deal, according to sources briefed on the discussions.
As the meeting started, one of the brothers told Sechin the deal process had been going on for too long, the exclusivity period had expired in July and Essar was now talking to other parties. 
Those other parties included Saudi Aramco, he said.
According to the sources familiar with how the meeting unfolded, Sechin responded by saying that if Essar walked away from the deal it risked losing Russian financial and oil-supply support.
The Ruia brothers then said the talks with Rosneft were over and called an abrupt end to the meeting.
""People started leaving the room, embarrassed,"" one of the sources said. Another source said the Essar management had drafted a statement to say the deal with Rosneft was off.
Rosneft and Essar declined to comment on what transpired at the meeting, or on whether such a statement had existed. Sechin and the Ruia brothers could not be reached for comment.
Three Saudi-based sources familiar with details of talks between Essar and Saudi Aramco said the firm was seriously considering buying Essar. One of the sources said Aramco was prepared to pay up to $9 billion for all or most of the refiner.
Aramco declined to comment on whether it had made a bid. 
TOO BIG TO FAIL
In the end, however, the Rosneft-Essar deal proved to be too big to fail.
For India, a deal collapse or a delay because of talks with another party would set back Modi's drive to clean up India's $140 billion mountain of bad debt given Essar's multi-billion-dollar debts to local and foreign banks after years of rapid expansion.
For Russia, the deal in the huge Indian market represented an important milestone in building a global oil empire despite Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its actions in Ukraine. 
Facing the Saudi competition, Rosneft formed a consortium that bought 98 per cent of the refiner plus a fuel terminal for $13 billion. The Kremlin oil firm bought 49 percent - below the 50 percent level that would have fallen foul of Western sanctions - with Swiss trading house Trafigura and Russian private investment group UCP buying the other 49 percent. 
According to the Indian and Russian industry sources, Rosneft and Essar returned to the negotiating table within days of the spat in early September, and the deal was finally struck.
One of the sources said there was a fierce battle between Essar and Rosneft over the terms. They said the Russian-led consortium was forced to outbid the Saudi offer, which they said comprised a combination of cash, long-term low interest credit and oil supplies. 
Trafigura declined to comment on how the deal came together, while UCP did not reply to a written request asking for comment. Washington said the deal did not violate sanctions.
The deal was signed in Mauritius on Oct. 14, a day before a formal announcement on the sidelines of a BRICS summit in Goa where Putin and Modi met. The leaders also oversaw the signing of a raft of other transactions including India agreeing to pay $5 billion for Russian long-range air defense missile systems.
Two industry sources said the Essar deal had first been discussed by Putin and Modi as far back as May 2014 on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg Economic Forum, Russia's main investor show. 
It was unclear what form - if any - high-level government intervention might have taken after the September dispute. 
But the two sources said that without political will in Moscow and New Delhi, an agreement could not have been struck. 
""Putin and Modi saved that deal,"" said one.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department finalized rules on Tuesday aimed at preventing methane leaks from oil and gas production on federal and tribal lands, one of the last major Obama administration rules aimed at fighting climate change.
Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) said on Tuesday the rule, updating 30-year-old regulations that govern flaring, venting and natural gas leaks from oil and gas production, could avoid wasting up to 41 billion cubic feet (BCF) of natural gas per year. 
“This rule to prevent waste of our nation’s natural gas supplies is good government, plain and simple,” said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. 
“We are proving that we can cut harmful methane emissions that contribute to climate change, while putting in place standards that make good economic sense for the nation.""
Environmental groups praised the rule, but industry and some western states called it unnecessary. One industry group sued BLM. The incoming Trump administration has promised to cut what it calls superfluous restrictions on energy production.
An Interior Department fact sheet said that between 2009 and 2015, oil and gas producers vented, flared and leaked 462 BCF of natural gas on federal and Indian lands, wasting as much as $23 million annually in royalty revenue.
Venting and leaks during oil and gas operations cause major emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas at least 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
The rule would phase in a limit on flaring over several years affecting 16 percent of oil wells, which account for 87 percent of gas flared, the BLM said.
Oil and gas operators can comply by expanding gas-capture technology or connecting wells to existing infrastructure through gathering lines.
Operators would have to use technology such as infrared cameras to detect methane leaks, invisible to the naked eye. BLM could also set and adjust royalty rates for oil and gas drilled on federal land to at or above 12.5 percent. Currently BLM has no discretion to raise the rate.
“Today’s announcement is a win for Western taxpayers. For too long, big oil companies have wasted natural gas that belongs to all Americans with no accountability,"" said Chris Saeger, Director of NGO Western Values Project.
“BLM is right to address methane waste from existing oil and gas facilities; these actions build on important state and federal progress already underway,"" said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund.

Moments after the rule's release, the Western Energy Alliance and Independent Petroleum Association of America filed a lawsuit against the BLM in a Wyoming court.

BP, one of the largest oil producers in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, said GE's Plant Operations Advisor (POA) software should help it save more than $200 million annually from its deployment at up to 33 platforms globally. 
The POA gathers data from various pieces of equipment on offshore platforms and processes it through GE's proprietary Predix software to inform BP engineers when a part may be near breaking down.
Terms of the BP-GE deal were not disclosed. The two companies started a partnership earlier this year with the goal of developing oilfield efficiency products.
""This makes it much easier for people to act on the information and the data we already collect,"" said Ahmed Hashmi, head of upstream technology at BP.
BP estimates that using the GE software program will boost its efficiency by 2 percent to 4 percent.
For GE's part, executives are hoping the BP partnership will portend future opportunities across the oil industry, especially ahead of the company's merger of its oil and gas division with  Baker Hughes  (N:BHI).

""Baker Hughes provides more opportunity to take Big Data into the oilfields,"" said Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of GE Oil & Gas. ""We're seeing good examples of how big data is changing the outcomes of the oil and gas industry.""

Exxon has appealed the Oct. 5 court ruling, but the appeals court hearing has been delayed because of the talks, Bloomberg reported, citing a lawyer for Exxon. (http://bloom.bg/2fRpf5n)
The court decision fined a consortium led by Exxon over 44 trillion CFA francs ($73.44 billion) - nearly four times BP's Deepwater Horizon settlement and roughly seven times Chad's annual gross domestic product.
The consortium, which includes Malaysian state oil firm Petronas  and Chadian oil company SNT, were found to owe the country nearly 484 billion CFA francs ($808 million) in royalties, according to the court judgment.
It did not explain why the penalty amounted to more than 90 times that amount.
The unpaid royalties stem from a dispute over fees, sources in the Chadian finance ministry have told Reuters. The finance ministry, they said, is seeking a 2 percent royalty fee from the consortium, a rate the defendants have said is higher than the agreed level.

Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Petronas and SNT could not immediately be reached.

Natural gas for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by as much as 2.7% earlier to a daily peak of $2.822 per million British thermal units.
It was last at $2.808 by 10:20AM ET (15:20GMT), after rallying 13.0 cents, or 4.96%, the day before, the biggest one-day gain since July.
Updated forecasting models showed a weather system pushing into the western U.S. later this week, which will then track toward the eastern U.S. next weekend, bringing rain, snow, and cooler than normal temperatures along with it.
Natural gas prices typically rise ahead of the winter as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand.
Meanwhile, market participants awaited weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 21 and 30 billion cubic feet in the week ended November 11.
That compares with a gain of 54 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 15 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 3 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at an all-time high of 4.017 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 1.2% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 4.7% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market analysts have warned that supplies in storage could peak at around 4.050 trillion cubic feet by the end of November unless subfreezing winter temperatures result in higher demand.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Demonstrators across U.S. cities will gather outside offices of the Army Corps of Engineers, banks and energy companies on Tuesday in the largest protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline since the U.S. government halted the project in September.
More than 200 protests are set to take place in a ""Day of Action"" called for by indigenous leaders in support of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and in an effort to urge the Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. government to stop the pipeline, according to Dallas Goldtooth, a spokesman for Indigenous Environmental Network, one of the organizers.
The $3.7 billion Dakota Access project has drawn steady opposition since last summer from the tribe, along with environmental activists, who claim it could pollute nearby water supplies and destroy sacred historical sites.
""The purpose is to elevate the issue and to encourage the Army Corps to exert its power to stop this pipeline,"" Goldtooth said of Tuesday's protests in which more than 30 groups, including Greenpeace and CREDO Action, are participating.
The Army Corps and Department of Interior on Monday delayed a decision on whether to grant an easement to Energy Transfer Partners, the main company behind the pipeline, for an easement to tunnel under Lake Oahe, the water source that is the focus of protests.
Construction of the 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline is about 85 percent complete, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), one of the pipeline's investors, said last week. The only outstanding construction work to be done in North Dakota is the segment of the line that would run under the lake, Energy Transfer said last week.
Energy Transfer has said the pipeline would be a more efficient and safer way to transport oil from the Bakken shale of North Dakota to the Midwest and onto the U.S. Gulf Coast. The company last week said it was confident the Army Corps would grant the easement, allowing it to begin drilling under the lake about two weeks later.
Tuesday's protests will be focused outside Army Corps offices throughout the country, and at major banks financing construction of the pipeline. Norwegian bank DNB this month said it would reconsider financing the project if the concerns of the Standing Rock Sioux were not addressed. In Houston, Texas, demonstrators will gather outside Energy Transfer Partners' office.
Although the protests were planned in advance of the November presidential election, they come as groups opposed to the Dakota Access line could face headwinds following the election of Republican Donald Trump.
While the president-elect has not weighed in on the Dakota Access specifically, he has expressed strong support for development of energy infrastructure projects, including oil pipelines.
Kelcy Warren, the top executive at Energy Transfer, donated more than $100,000 to the Trump campaign.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Soros Fund Management LLC dissolved its shares in the world's biggest gold exchange-traded fund in the third quarter of 2016, ahead of the U.S. presidential election, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed on Monday.
By the end of September, billionaire financier George Soros' fund eliminated its position in SPDR Gold Trust as bullion prices briefly rose to the highest in more than two years, having held 240,000 shares worth $30.4 million in the second quarter, 
Soros more than doubled its shares in miner Barrick Gold Corp to 2.85 million shares worth $50.5 million, from 1.07 million shares in the second quarter, the 13F filing showed.
Paulson & Co, led by longtime gold bull John Paulson, held its stake in SPDR Gold Trust unchanged at 4.78 million shares. Its value fell to $600 million by the end of the third quarter from $603.9 million in the second quarter.
Inflows into SPDR Gold Trust increased by more than 3 percent to a three-year high in the third quarter as higher gold prices typically attract investment money to bullion, which is often seen as a hedge against inflation. [GOL/ETF]
In July, spot gold prices extended the steep 25 percent gains made in the first half of 2016 to peak at $1,374.91 an ounce, the highest since March 2014.

62,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2016 04:04PM ET</span>",Oil mogul Hamm tops Trump list for U.S. energy secretary: sources,"By Michelle Conlin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Continental Resources Chief Executive Harold Hamm is at the top of President-elect Donald Trump's list to serve as energy secretary, according to U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a Trump energy adviser who confirmed he is also under consideration for the job.
""In my view, Harold Hamm has the right of first refusal,"" Cramer told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""In my view, he's likely to be asked. And, because he's a patriot and an American, he's likely to say yes.""
Hamm, 70, became one of America's wealthiest men during the U.S. oil and gas drilling boom over the past decade, tapping into controversial hydraulic fracturing drilling technology to access vast deposits in North Dakota's shale fields.
Continental spokeswoman Kristin Thomas said, ""There has never been a conversation"" between Trump and Hamm about the position. She declined to speculate on how Hamm would respond if asked to take the job.
People close to Hamm were mixed on the possibility.
""I think Harold would be great in the (Energy Secretary) job. If the president calls, I think he would do it,"" said Mike Cantrell, a former vice president of government affairs at Continental who remains close to Hamm.
Another prominent U.S. oil and gas executive who knows Hamm and asked not to be named, however, said he doubted Hamm would be willing to leave Continental and may be more interested in having a strong say in who gets the job.
Aside from Hamm and Cramer, Trump's short list for energy secretary also includes venture capitalist Robert Grady, who served as associate director for Natural Resources, Energy and Science in President George H. W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget, according to Cramer and two other sources with knowledge of the situation.
Grady did not respond to requests for comment. 
If Hamm is nominated, the Oklahoman would be the first U.S. energy secretary drawn directly from the industry since the cabinet position was created in 1977, a move that would jolt environmental advocates but bolster Trump's pro-drilling energy platform.
Trump, a Republican who will take office on Jan. 20 and succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, is also working to fill other top administration jobs in the coming weeks.
SECOND TIME AROUND
Hamm addressed the Republican convention in July, calling for expanded drilling and saying too much environmental regulation threatened to limit U.S. oil production and increase the country's dependence on Middle East oil producers. 
Past heads of the U.S. Department of Energy, which is charged with advancing U.S. energy security and technology, including nuclear weapons production and labs, have typically boasted a political or academic background.
Dan Eberhart, a Texas oil investor and Republican party financier who has worked with Hamm and has had conversations with the Trump campaign, said, ""I know Hamm is being seriously considered. And I know that he wants it.""
A former Capitol Hill staffer who knows both Hamm and Cramer said he thought Trump would be wise to favor the North Dakota congressman, a self-described climate change skeptic who has a history of supporting the oil, gas and coal sectors.
""Both Hamm and Cramer would be fantastic choices, but I think Cramer brings more balance and stability,"" he said, asking not to be named. 
This is not the first time Hamm has been in contention for the job.
The Republican Party's presidential nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, vetted Hamm to be energy secretary but ultimately decided against him because the two men have differing positions on renewable energy sources like wind.

Hamm made headlines in 2015 after settling a protracted divorce case and agreeing to pay his ex-wife $975 million - reported to be one of the biggest divorce settlement in history.

Natural gas for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 13.0 cents, or 4.96%, to $2.749 per million British thermal units by 10:10AM ET (15:10GMT), after rallying to $2.752 in early trade.
Updated forecasting models showed a weather system pushing into the western U.S. later this week, which will then track toward the eastern U.S. next weekend, bringing rain, snow, and cooler than normal temperatures along with it.
That prompted traders to close out bets on lower prices, a move known as short-covering.
Natural gas futures lost more than 5% last week and are down nearly 10% so far this month as a mild start to the winter heating season added to concerns over a deepening supply glut.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather reduces demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
Meanwhile, market participants awaited weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 21 and 30 billion cubic feet in the week ended November 11.
That compares with a gain of 54 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 15 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 3 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at an all-time high of 4.017 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 1.2% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 4.7% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market analysts have warned that supplies in storage could peak at around 4.050 trillion cubic feet by the end of November unless subfreezing winter temperatures result in higher demand.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell to its lowest in three months on Monday, as the prospect of another year of oversupply and weak prices overshadowed chances that OPEC will reach a deal to cut output.
Donald Trump's surprise victory in last week's U.S. presidential election has boosted stocks and the dollar, but undermined much of the commodities complex, including oil, which has sagged as expectations that the world's largest exporters will agree to reduce output this month have waned.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) fell 43 cents on the day to $44.32 a barrel by 1205 GMT (7:05 a.m. ET), while NYMEX crude futures (CLc1) shed 56 cents to trade at $42.85 a barrel. 
""In the same way that a strong OPEC agreement was needed to continue the rally above $55, a lack of agreement will be needed to break below $40 and right now, we're at $45,"" Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said.
""So I think on a risk basis, we're starting to be a bit more concerned about the upside price risk, than about the downside.""
OPEC plans to cut or freeze output, but analysts doubt the group's ability to reach an agreement at its meeting on Nov. 30.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said on Friday its output hit a record 33.64 million barrels per day in October, and forecast an even larger global surplus in 2017 than the International Energy Agency on Thursday. [IEA/M]
Yet, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih has said it was imperative for OPEC to reach a consensus on activating a deal made in September in Algiers to cut production. 
""OPEC know what needs to be done but too few members will agree to take the production pain for the price gain, knowing also that the price gain incentivizes non-OPEC to produce more, lengthening the rebalancing process,"" PVM Oil Associates analyst David Hufton said.
The dollar index (DXY) hit an 11-month peak on Monday, driven by an aggressive sell-off in bonds that has pushed Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) to their highest since January.
Ordinarily, a strong dollar would push oil lower, but the correlation between the two is at its most positive in two months, suggesting they are more likely to move in lockstep with one another than in opposite directions.

Data from the InterContinental Exchange on Monday showed investors delivered the largest weekly cut on record to their bets on a sustained rise in the price of oil. [O/ICE]

(Reuters) - North Dakota authorities are investigating a weekend incident in which pipeline protesters said a woman was struck by a man driving a truck who drove over her feet and fired shots into the air.
The Morton County Sheriff's Department is looking into what occurred, spokesman Rob Keller said in an email on Sunday, declining to comment further because the investigation is ongoing.
Early on Saturday, protesters against the oil pipeline near sacred tribal lands briefly blocked two entrances to a work yard near the rural town of Mandan, causing workers to leave the area.
Videos and pictures posted online show a man in a white vehicle holding a handgun and yelling obscenities while driving forward through a crowd of protesters. One video shows the man later raising his gun into the air and firing several shots, although it is not clear from the video whether any protesters were nearby at the time. The man was not identified. 
A protester was injured in the incident and an ambulance was called, but she refused treatment, Keller said.
The circumstances of the injury were not clear, but one video shows the man striking a woman while she hangs off the truck's side-view mirror. Protesters said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that a woman's hand had been smashed, requiring three stitches on a finger, and that her feet had been run over. The woman could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Vicki Granado, a spokeswoman for Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners, the company leading the construction of the pipeline, said the man with the gun ""is not associated with the pipeline project in any way."" 
""It is my understanding he lives in the area and was just trying to get where he needed to go and felt threatened,"" Granado said in an email.
Protests have sometimes turned violent over the $3.8 billion Dakota Access construction project, which has drawn steady opposition from Native American and environmental activists since the summer.
Last month, a demonstrator was charged with the attempted murder of a law enforcement officer. Authorities said she fired at a police officer three times during a struggle without hitting him.

The 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline, being built by a group of companies led by  Energy Transfer Partners LP  (N:ETP), would offer the fastest and most direct route to bring Bakken shale oil from North Dakota to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in December ell 0.28% to $43.29 a barrel. On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for January gained 0.34% to $44.70.
China said fixed asset investment for October rose 8.3%, beating the 8.2% rise seen year-on-year and industrial production gained 6.1%, below the expected 6.2% rise seen and retail sales increased 10.0%, below the 10.7% increase seen.
Earlier, Japan reported third quarter GDP jumped 0.5% quarter-on-quarter and at a 2.2% pace year-on-year, handily beating expected gains of 0.2% and 0.9% respectively.
Oil futures tumbled to multi-week lows on Friday after OPEC reported that its crude production rose to its highest level on record and pointed to a larger surplus next year, despite an agreement to potentially cut output.
In its monthly market report published Friday, OPEC said that output from its own 14 members increased by 240,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 33.64 million in October, with Nigeria, Libya and Iraq blamed for the increase.
With demand for OPEC crude in 2017 expected to average 32.69 million bpd, the report indicates there will now be an average surplus of 950,000 bpd if OPEC keeps output steady. Last month's report pointed to an 800,000-bpd surplus.
The bearish report came one day after the International Energy Agency warned that the market risks running another surplus in 2017 without an output cut from OPEC.
The IEA said global supply rose by 800,000 bpd in October to 97.8 million, led by record OPEC output and rising production from non-OPEC members such as Russia, Brazil, Canada and Kazakhstan.
The Paris-based organization kept its demand growth forecast for 2016 at 1.2 million bpd and expects consumption to increase at the same pace next year, having gradually slowed from a five-year peak of 1.8 million bpd in 2015.
The reports added to skepticism over the implementation of a planned deal by OPEC to limit production.
The oil group reached an agreement to cap output to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held in Algeria in late September. However, OPEC said it won’t finalize details on individual output quotas until its next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.
The possibility that producers could walk away empty-handed from the November meeting looms large after Iraq, Iran, Nigeria and Libya all signaled they might not take part in the proposed production cut deal. Russia’s unclear stance is also fueling uncertainty.
Prices stayed lower after oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week rose by 2 to 452, the 21st increase out of the last 24 weeks.
Prices were also weighed by evidence of rising crude supplies in the U.S., where weekly supply data on Wednesday showed a larger than expected build in oil stockpiles.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said that crude oil inventories rose by 2.4 million barrels last week to 485.0 million, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
After a historic week in which U.S. politics dominated market sentiment, investors will get back to the business of watching the Federal Reserve and economic data in the coming days as expectations mount for a December rate hike.
Meanwhile, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.

On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for January was last quoted at 44.55 a barrel.
In its monthly market report published Friday, OPEC said that output from its own 14 members increased by 240,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 33.64 million in October, with Nigeria, Libya and Iraq blamed for the increase.

The oil group reached an agreement to cap output to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held in Algeria in late September. However, OPEC said it won’t finalize details on individual output quotas until its next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.

LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC reported an increase in its oil production in October to a record high led by members hoping to be exempt from the producer group's attempt to curb supply, weighing on prices and pointing to a larger global surplus next year.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 33.64 million barrels per day (bpd) last month, according to figures OPEC collects from secondary sources, up 240,000 bpd from September, OPEC said in a monthly report.
The OPEC figures point to a bigger surplus than those of the International Energy Agency and underline OPEC's challenge in restraining supplies. Oil (LCOc1) fell below $45 a barrel after the report was released, having reached a 2016 high near $54 after OPEC's deal was announced in September.
OPEC made little mention of the surprise election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president, beyond noting that currency markets had seen ""significant"" volatility. It left unchanged its 2017 forecasts for U.S. and world economic growth.
""More data over the coming months will provide further insight to allow a more detailed review of the U.S. economic situation, particularly after the most recent elections,"" OPEC said in the report.
To speed up a rebalancing of the market, OPEC agreed at a meeting in Algeria on Sept. 28 to cut supply to between 32.50 million bpd and 33.0 million bpd. The group hopes to finalize further details at a meeting on Nov. 30.
The latest figures could complicate OPEC talks on how to share out the cuts. OPEC experts meet to discuss this on Nov. 25 and on Nov. 28 will meet officials from non-OPEC countries, OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said on Monday. 
According to OPEC's report, October's supply boost mostly came from Libya, Nigeria and Iraq - members that have sought to be exempt from cuts due to conflict. Iran, seeking an exemption as output was held back by Western sanctions, also pumped more. 
OPEC uses two sets of figures to monitor its output - figures provided by each country, and secondary sources which include industry media. This is a legacy of old disputes over how much countries were really pumping.
Iran told OPEC it produced 3.92 million bpd in October, while the secondary sources put output at 3.69 million bpd. From Iran's point of view, joining the OPEC supply cut deal from the higher figure would be more favorable.
OPEC issued a revised report on Friday to add Iraq's figure. Baghdad, which has questioned the accuracy of the secondary-source numbers, told OPEC its October output was steady at 4.77 million bpd - 210,000 million bpd more than the secondary sources estimate.
That aside, OPEC's report is the latest to show output is hitting new peaks. The October figure is the highest since at least 2008, according to a Reuters review of past OPEC reports.
In the report, OPEC trimmed its forecast of non-OPEC supply this year, although supply growth in 2017 is put at 230,000 bpd, little changed from last month.
With demand for OPEC crude in 2017 expected to average 32.69 million bpd, the report indicates there will now be an average surplus of 950,000 bpd if OPEC keeps output steady. Last month's report pointed to an 800,000 bpd surplus. 

The 2017 surplus implied by the IEA in its latest report on Thursday is closer to 500,000 bpd.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's top oil producer Rosneft reported strong cashflow on Friday, strengthening its position for a continuing acquisition drive despite a worse than expected 77 percent decline in third-quarter net profit.
Rosneft, which bought a controlling stake in mid-sized oil company Bashneft for 323 billion rubles ($4.9 billion) last month, has been looking for ways to increase its global exposure and become a leading international oil major. 
The Kremlin-controlled company also intends to buy back 19.5 percent of its shares from state holding company Rosneftegaz (ROSNG.UL) as Russia looks to step up privatization plans. 
Rosneft said on Friday that it had generated free cashflow of $4.1 billion in the first nine months of the year in contrast to negative cashflow at several rival oil majors.
Third-quarter net profit, however, tumbled by nearly 80 percent year on year to 26 billion rubles ($401 million), with the company citing weak oil prices.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast net income of 45 billion rubles.
""The environment on the commodity markets remained difficult,"" Chief Executive Igor Sechin said in a statement, adding that profitability was also pressured by the lag effect on export duty.
Rosneft could also receive funding for its buyback from Rosneftegaz, sources have told Reuters, and the government has said the deal would be of a transitory nature with the stake eventually being sold to investors.
BUYBACK FUNDING
Egor Fedorov, a senior credit analyst at ING Wholesale Banking in Moscow, said: ""According to analyst's calculations, by the end of nine months, Rosneftegaz had accumulated around 543.4 billion rubles in cash and short-term financial assets, from which nearly 387 billion rubles could be provided to Rosneft,"" he said. 
Rosneft also said it would have to redeem debt of $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter and $12.9 billion in 2017. In the third quarter net debt rose by 11.5 percent from the previous three months to $26.1 billion.
Sales, meanwhile, declined by 4 percent year on year to 1.22 trillion rubles and analysts are eager to for further guidance on the company's production outlook.
Earlier this week, Rosneft said oil production rose in the third quarter by 1.3 percent year on year to 4.15 million barrels per day. 
That is more oil than the amount produced by Iraq, OPEC's second-largest crude producer, and could complicate global talks to curb output to support prices. Sechin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has told Reuters that Rosneft would not cap its production.
According to a document seen by Reuters, Sechin is due to present a speech at a meeting on the energy sector chaired by Putin on Nov. 23, a week before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meets in Vienna to discuss production cuts.
Shares in Rosneft Rosneft's shares were down 0.7 percent at 0620 ET.

On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the January Brent contract tumbled 1.20% to trade at $45.28 a barrel, not far from Wednesday’s three-month trough of $44.40.

The December contract ended Thursday’s session 0.56% lower at $1,266.40 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,249.90, the low from October 17 and resistance at $1,287.50, Thursday’s high.
Demand for the safe-haven precious metal weakened as investors began to think that a Trump presidency may not be as bad for financial markets as initially expected.
Market participants were especially hoping to see Trump's policies boost spending and inflation in the U.S.
Donald Trump was declared the 45th U.S. President on Wednesday, confounding expectations for a Democratic victory.
Gold was also hit by a stronger dollar, after the U.S. Department of Labor said on Thursday that initial jobless claims decreased by 11,000 to 254,000 in the week ending November 5. Analysts had expected jobless claims to drop by 5,000 to 260,000 last week.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.18% at 98.60, just off Thursday’s two-and-a-half week highs of 99.08.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.

Prices of the red metal gained 7.9 cents, or 3.34%, on Wednesday after Trump's victory speech included a pledge to spend on rebuilding America's infrastructure.
The metal is regarded as a leading indicator of the global economy. It is used in the construction of buildings, power generation and transmission and the manufacture of consumer electronics.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Friday as the market refocused on a persistent fuel supply overhang that is not expected to abate unless OPEC and other producers make a significant cut to their output.
International Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) were trading at $45.77 per barrel at 0743 GMT (2:43 a.m. ET), down 7 cents from their last close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures (CLc1) were trading down 10 cents at $44.56 per barrel, weighed down by weakening U.S. demand.
""This week, both U.S. gasoline and diesel demand decelerated on a 4-week rolling average basis to -2.1 percent year-on-year and +0.9 percent, respectively,"" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said on Friday.
Traders said that an ongoing crude and refined product supply overhang that has dogged markets for over two years was dragging on markets.
""Crude oil prices fell as the focus returned to supply growth. The IEA suggested prices may continue to retreat amid relentless supply growth unless OPEC makes significant supply cuts,"" ANZ bank said on Friday.
The supply overhang could run into a third year in 2017 without an output cut from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), while escalating production from other exporters could lead to relentless supply growth, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday.
In its monthly oil market report, the group said global supply rose by 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) in October to 97.8 million bpd, led by record OPEC output and rising production from non-OPEC members such as Russia, Brazil, Canada and Kazakhstan.
In Africa, Nigeria is working out new oil and gas policies to attract more private investors and boost crude production by 500,000 bpd by 2020, state firm NNPC said on Thursday.
The IEA kept its demand growth forecast for 2016 at 1.2 million bpd and expects consumption to increase at the same pace next year, having gradually slowed from a five-year peak of 1.8 million bpd in 2015. 
Beyond oversupply, a surging dollar (DXY) following the initial shock of Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election win also put pressure on prices, traders said.

Because oil and refined products are traded in dollars, its import costs rise for any country using other currencies at home, potentially crimping demand.

The world's top consumer of many raw materials has been pushing to boost its influence on pricing of everything from iron ore to oil, mainly through steps such as promoting Chinese futures contracts as regional or global benchmarks.
But analysts and traders said that a wave of moves to cool coal prices, which surged as a side-effect of radical government measures to fight pollution by curbing mining, show that Beijing could be reluctant to let markets trade freely and openly.
""(Moves like those taken in coal markets) dampen hopes from investors that the government will be transparent,"" said Wang Fei, a coal analyst in eastern China.
Soaring coal markets have sparked a weeks-long effort by China's state economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), to rein in prices, culminating in Wednesday's announcement that two of the nation's top coal miners had signed long-term supply contracts with a utility at a quarter below current spot rates.
Market sources said the body had ramped up its meetings with coal miners to as many as three a week from the usual monthly gatherings. The latest meeting is scheduled for Friday.
Adding to its scrutiny over the market, the NDRC also said on Wednesday that it was vetting the sector for hoarding, as well as investigating a coal pricing data firm in the province of Shanxi for ""problems"" in its data.
While the NDRC did not give any details, FenWei Energy, a Shanxi-based coal data company, this week suspended its spot physical thermal coal price index - used as the domestic industry benchmark - saying its prices did not reflect the majority of business transacted in the country.
The NDRC did not respond to requests for comment.
Meanwhile, China's three main commodity exchanges this week launched a series of fee and margin hikes in a coordinated effort to make it more expensive to trade everything from thermal coal to rubber to ferro-silicon to tame wild price swings.
With all these steps, the BSPI weekly index published on Thursday fell by 1 yuan per ton to 606 yuan per ton, its first drop in 4-1/2 months. Even so, the price remained close to historic highs supported by robust demand as the first cold spells of winter start to grip the country.
TRUE TO FORM?
The government has form when it comes to exerting pressure on financial markets. Past tactics have included halting margin trading in equities last year and changing trading limits and margin requirements for some commodity futures contracts earlier this year.
And the latest moves come just as the Shanghai International Energy Exchange, known as INE, prepares to launch a crude oil futures contract that will compete with established benchmarks in the United States and Europe. INE did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.
""If NDRC can do this to the coal industry, it can deploy the same strategy with other commodities,"" said Lin Boqiang, director at the energy institute at Xiamen University.

90,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2016 03:50PM ET</span>",Trade group urges Trump to revise auto emissions rules,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A major auto trade group on Thursday urged President-elect Donald Trump's transition team to revise fuel efficiency mandates that could cost them billions of dollars and called for a full-scale review of the Obama administration's autonomous vehicle policies.
In an eight-page letter Thursday to Trump's transition team made public and reported earlier by Reuters, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which presents major automakers including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Toyota Motor Corp, urged the incoming Trump White House to find ""a pathway forward"" on setting final fuel efficiency standards through 2025, calling on the next administration to ""harmonize and adjust"" the rules.
The letter also urges Trump to create a presidential advisory committee to ""coordinate auto sector regulators"" and said the panel could suggest a new approach to auto regulations.
Automakers told Trump's team in the letter ""technology and change are swamping the regulatory capacity to manage our emerging reality. Reform is imperative.""
Major automakers have raised concerns about the Obama administration's ambitious targets for cutting vehicle greenhouse gas emissions through 2025, arguing low gasoline prices and weak demand for electric vehicles may require significant revisions to the rules. 
The automakers' letter urges the Trump administration to conduct a ""comprehensive regulatory review"" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's new guidance on self-driving vehicles. 
In September, the Obama administration unveiled guidance asking automakers to voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems in a 15 point ""safety assessment."" 
The Obama administration said it was considering seeking the power to review and approve technology for self-driving cars before they hit the road.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must decide by April 2018 whether the 2022 through 2025 model year requirements for fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions are feasible or should be changed. 
Automakers in 2011 backed aggressive fuel rules to nearly double fuel efficiency by 2025, but only if the policy included a ""mid-term review.""
On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly vowed to restore auto jobs. On Wednesday, GM said it would cut 2,000 jobs because of slowing demand for smaller cars.
Automakers have expressed concern that states may set their own self-driving rules that could make it difficult or impossible to roll out the technology. 
The letter wants the Trump administration to harmonize fuel rules, warning automakers ""may be in compliance with the EPA program, yet subject to fines in the NHTSA program... Potentially billions of dollars in fines under the NHTSA (fuel economy) program are anticipated."" 
The letter also seeks a ""robust examination"" of the combined impact of ""uncoordinated regulatory oversight"" by at least 10 federal and state agencies. 
It urges creation of a new timetable for regulators to respond to industry requests and seeks that regulators adopt a ""whole car cost analysis"" for new vehicle regulations.

The Trump transition team, NHTSA and the EPA did not immediately comment on the letter.

91,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2016 12:38PM ET</span>",ConocoPhillips aims to sell up to $8 billion in gas assets,"By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (N:COP), the largest U.S. independent oil producer, will sell up to $8 billion in natural gas assets and trim its capital budget by 4 percent next year to provide funds to bolster operations, executives said on Thursday.
The moves highlighted not only the energy industry's increasing push for efficiency gains that reduce the cost of drawing oil and natural gas from the earth but also low commodity prices, which have hampered Conoco and peers the past two years.
Shares of the Houston-based company fell about 2.6 percent to $44.53 in midday trading as U.S. oil prices (CLc1) fell more than 1.3 percent. 
The asset sale alone reflects a bold move by Chief Executive Ryan Lance to reduce the company's $28.7 billion debt load. 
Conoco plans to sell $5 billion to $8 billion in North American natural gas assets, a divestiture that is massive in its size and scope. For example, Chesapeake Energy Corp (N:CHK), the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer, has a $5 billion market valuation.
The spending reduction comes after Conoco more than halved its budget last year. Indeed, its 2015 capex had eclipsed $10 billion.
""The world has changed,"" Lance said Thursday morning in an annual presentation to analysts and investors in New York.
""You can't count on rising commodity prices to bail out your business model,"" Lance said. ""You have to position your business for the commodity price cycles.""
Lance, CEO since 2012, said the spending cuts, asset sales and other steps should help the company be profitable with Brent oil prices (LCOc1) of $50 per barrel. Brent traded at $46.18 on Thursday.
Most of the budget next year will be spent on shale projects in the contiguous United States, with some focus on Alaska and Europe, as well as maintenance of existing operations.
The focus is smaller than earlier this decade, when ConocoPhillips operated in more than 28 locations around the globe. Today it operates in about 14, a smaller portfolio that executives said would further help focus capital.
""When your treadmill's not running at breakneck speed, you can focus on quality, not quantity,"" Don Wallette, the company's finance chief, told analysts. 
The spending should result in 2017 production of 1.54 million to 1.57 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which would be a slight increase from estimated 2016 output, executives said. 

The company also announced a $3 billion share repurchase program. The buybacks will start this quarter, the company said.

92,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 10, 2016 10:32AM ET</span>",U.S. natural gas slides 4% after weekly storage data,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures fell sharply on Thursday morning, after data showed that natural gas supplies in storage in the U.S. rose slightly more than forecast last week.
Natural gas for delivery in December on the New York Mercantile Exchange tumbled 8.4 cents, or 3.12%, to $2.607 per million British thermal units by 10:32AM ET (15:32GMT). Futures were at around $2.615 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 54 billion cubic feet in the week ended November 4, just above market expectations for an increase of 53 billion cubic feet.
That compared with a gain of 54 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 54 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 38 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 4.017 trillion cubic feet, just 1.2% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 4.7% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, updated weather forecasting models showed that high pressure weather systems will dominate over the central and southern U.S. in the coming days, resulting in much warmer than normal conditions.
Overall, demand for natural gas will be much lighter than normal with the lack of subfreezing temperatures across the eastern U.S. and the Great Lakes-region.
Natural gas futures are down almost 16% over the past two weeks as a mild start to the winter heating season added to concerns over a deepening supply glut.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather reduces demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Thursday as markets recovered from their initial shock at U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's surprise victory, but investors were cautious ahead of a key OPEC meeting to decide on production.
Most markets shook off post-election losses and bounced back on Thursday. 
But the oil market is heavily oversupplied and investors are focusing on a gathering of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Nov. 30, which may lead to output cuts.
Brent crude was up 10 cents at $46.46 a barrel by 0920 GMT. U.S. light crude was down 10 cents at $45.17.
""If no agreement is reached and some individual members continue to expand their production then the market will remain in surplus throughout the year, with little prospect of oil prices rising significantly higher,"" the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its monthly report on Thursday.
""If the supply surplus persists in 2017 there must be some risk of prices falling back,"" the IEA added.
Carsten Fritsch, senior oil and commodities analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt, agreed:
""We are still in an oversupplied market and that is not going to change for the foreseeable future unless OPEC cuts.""
The market was dampened by a 2.4-million-barrel rise in U.S. crude inventories to 485 million barrels last week, reported by the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.
Investors are still assessing the long-term impact of a Trump presidency on world oil supply and demand.
BMI Research said the billionaire's expected pro oil and gas industry policies might mean U.S. ""production of oil and gas could recover at a faster rate in 2017 as developers grow more encouraged"".
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said a Trump presidency would likely result in higher investment and, in time, increased U.S. oil output as the president-elect has said he would deregulate fossil fuel production.
Internationally, the bank said Trump's threat of renewed U.S. sanctions against OPEC member Iran would ""further incentivize Iran to maximize production in the short term rather than comply to an OPEC freeze"".

This reinforced traders' doubts over the ability of OPEC and other producers such as Russia to trim output to prop up prices.

LONDON (Reuters) - The oil market risks running another surplus in 2017 without an output cut from OPEC, as producers around the globe ramp up supply and demand growth falters, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday. 
In its monthly oil market report, the group said global supply rose by 800,000 barrels per day in October to 97.8 million bpd, led by record OPEC output and rising production from non-OPEC members such as Russia, Brazil, Canada and Kazakhstan.
The Paris-based IEA kept its demand growth forecast for 2016 at 1.2 million bpd and expects consumption to increase at the same pace next year, having gradually slowed from a five-year peak of 1.8 million bpd in 2015.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets at the end of November to discuss a proposed cut in production to a range of 32.5 to 33 million bpd, but discord among members over exemptions and production levels has raised doubt over OPEC's ability to deliver a meaningful reduction.
""Whatever the outcome, the Vienna meeting will have a major impact on the eventual - and oft-postponed - rebalancing of the oil market,"" the IEA said.
""If no agreement is reached and some individual members continue to expand their production then the market will remain in surplus throughout the year, with little prospect of oil prices rising significantly higher. Indeed, if the supply surplus persists in 2017 there must be some risk of prices falling back.""
The group said it expects non-OPEC production to grow at a rate of 500,000 bpd next year, compared with a 900,000-bpd decline this year, meaning 2017 could see inventories building again if there is no cut from OPEC.
""This means that 2017 could be another year of relentless global supply growth similar to that seen in 2016,"" the IEA said.
Furthermore, slower global economic growth and more modest demand in previous consumption hot spots such as India and China mean overall demand for oil will likely not pick up next year, the IEA said.

""There is currently little evidence to suggest that economic activity is sufficiently robust to deliver higher oil demand growth, and any stimulus that might have been provided at the end of 2015 and in the early part of 2016 when crude oil prices fell below $30 a barrel is now in the past,"" the agency said.

Crude oil for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 0.15% to $45.20 a barrel.
Overnight, oil prices edged lower during North American hours on Wednesday, after data showed that crude supplies rose the second straight week.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 2.4 million barrels in the week ended November 4. Market analysts' expected a crude-stock gain of 1.3 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply increase of 4.4 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, increased by 28,000 barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 485.0 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories decreased by 2.8 million barrels, compared to expectations for a decline of 1.0 million barrels.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a drop of 1.9 million barrels.
Brent oil for January delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was last quoted at $46.53 a barrel.
Oil plunged along with other risk-sensitive assets overnight as Donald Trump shocked financial markets by winning the U.S. presidential election.
But sentiment recovered after Trump gave a victory speech in which he said he would seek common ground and not hostility, contrasting the heated words he has become famous for at campaign rallies.
Meanwhile, oil traders continued to weigh prospects of a coordinated production cut among major global oil producers.
OPEC reached an agreement to cap output to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held in Algeria in late September. However, the 14-member oil group said it won’t finalize details on individual output quotas until its next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.
The possibility that producers could walk away empty-handed from the November meeting looms large after Iraq, Iran, Nigeria and Libya all signaled they might not take part in the proposed production cut deal. Russia’s unclear stance is also fueling uncertainty.

105,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2016 05:00PM ET</span>","Big Oil revels in Trump victory, expects less red tape","By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - The U.S. energy industry on Wednesday reveled in Republican Donald Trump's presidential victory, expecting him to advocate for more oil and gas output and to cut red tape holding back billions of dollars of investment in new projects.
Shares of most oil and gas producers, energy construction firms and pipeline operators rose after the election results, while crude oil prices also settled higher. 
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, said it hoped Trump's administration would use ""sound science"" on future regulations.
Exxon has drawn fire from environmentalists who say the company misled investors and the public about the risks of climate change. Trump has previously called climate change a hoax.
""We intend to work constructively with the president-elect and his administration,"" said Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers.
Exxon's shares were up about 1.0 percent, and shares of  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) rose about 0.3 percent.
The world's largest energy market saw an energy revolution under Democratic President Barack Obama's administration, as improved technology led to the rapid development of shale oil and gas reserves.
Even as shale expanded, the energy industry bemoaned environmental regulations that slowed development. Now, the industry expects Trump to roll back those restrictions. For one thing, Trump has promised to rescind the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Rule, which the industry called an attempt to regulate fracking.
ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), the largest U.S. independent oil producer, said it would work with Trump to protect the environment but also to produce needed oil and gas.
""The American people have spoken and elected Mr. Trump as president and ConocoPhillips respects that choice,"" spokesman Daren Beaudo said.
While Trump has given few details on energy policy, he has surrounded himself with shale industry supporters and he backs development of infrastructure, including pipelines.
""We are looking forward to President Trump doing what he promised, which is to undo many of the onerous regulations that have plagued our industry throughout an Obama presidency,"" Harold Hamm, chief executive officer of oil producer Continental Resources Inc, said in a statement. 
Trump has considered making Hamm the first energy secretary from the oil and gas industry since the position was created in 1977.
Trump's promise to create jobs and boost manufacturing could bode well for delayed energy projects across the United States, including the Dakota Access Pipeline, analysts said.
SHARE MOVEMENT 
Shale oil-focused shares outpaced the wider oil and gas sector gains on Wednesday. Oasis Petroleum and Whiting Petroleum, spiked about 5 percent, a sign of optimism that the federal government would not impose more restrictions on fracking, and leave such regulation to individual states. 
Shares of oil construction companies also jumped, including KBR Inc , Chicago Bridge & Iron and Jacobs Engineering Group (NYSE:JEC) . 
Pipeline companies rallied, as the Trump victory gave a fillip to an industry whose growth prospects have been hit by environmental and native group activism as well as the steep two-year oil price slump. 
TransCanada Corp, which wants to build the Keystone XL pipeline, rose more than 1 percent. During the election campaign, Trump said he would approve the pipeline if elected.
The Trump administration will not be able to change bearish oil fundamentals of oversupply and lagging demand. A rise in U.S. oil output could further pressure crude prices that remain around half of levels just over two years ago.
The energy stock rally on Wednesday ""has little to do with fundamentals and leaves us more incrementally concerned than bullish,"" said Tim Rezvan, an oil industry analyst with Mizuho Securities USA.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets to negotiate output cuts, and the election result could influence OPEC's meeting.
A Trump administration was not expected to oppose drilling on public lands and may be interested in advancing coal leases on public lands, with advice coming from the industry, said Scott Segal, co-head of the federal government relations practice at Bracewell LLP.
""I believe this administration will rely heavily on corporate America to understand the issues,"" Segal said.
In North Dakota, the No. 2 oil producing state, Trump's victory was seen as a boon for energy companies. 
""Trump is bullish on the economy. He's bullish on energy. He's got the wherewithal to make it all happen,"" said Ron Ness, head of the North Dakota Petroleum Council trade group.

""This is a day of tremendous optimism for the energy industry.""

MARRAKESH, Morocco (Reuters) - Donald Trump's election as U.S. president triggered fears that his view that global warming is a hoax might lead other nations to scale back ambitions under a landmark climate change deal, while renewable energy stocks fell on world markets.
Trump's victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton cast a cloud over delegates attending a 200-nation meeting in Marrakesh to celebrate the start of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming last Friday. 
Trump has threatened to tear up the Paris accord for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, worked out in two decades of negotiations by countries as diverse as China, Pacific islands and OPEC oil producers.
Some delegates expressed concern that Trump, who in the past has dismissed climate change as a hoax, could cause other nations to reconsider their position on global warming. Trump has also said climate change was an invention by China and wants instead to promote jobs in the U.S. fossil fuel industry.
""We will have a lot more hurdles,"" said Ian Fry, head of the delegation from Tuvalu, a Pacific island state which fears rising sea levels. He said Trump's victory could have a ""domino effect on other nations"".
The Paris Agreement allows all nations to set national targets to slow climate change and some could scale those back. The Marrakesh talks are also meant to start writing a ""rule book"" to oversee the pact that might be less stringent without the United States. There are no sanctions for non-compliance.
Many nations vowed to push ahead despite Trump with the sweeping plan to phase out net global greenhouse gas emissions between 2050 and 2100 by shifting from coal and oil to cleaner energies such as wind or solar power.
""The world can count on (the) EU to continue to lead on climate and drive the global clean energy transition. We need all our partners on board,"" European Climate Commissioner Arias Canete wrote in a Tweet.
""No change,"" Japan's delegation chief in Marrakesh, Shigeru Ushio, told Reuters of Japan's policies. He noted the agreement says it will take four years for any country to pull out of the agreement - the length of Trump's presidential term.
On markets, Trump's victory drove down renewable energy stocks. Shares in Vestas (CO:VWS), the world's biggest wind turbine maker, were down 8.6 percent, while Germany's  Nordex  (DE:NDXG) traded 7.9 percent lower.
By contrast, benchmark coal prices  were up 2.3 percent.
""DARK, DARK DAY""
Many delegates expressed hopes Trump as president would accept mainstream scientific findings. A U.N. panel of climate scientists says it is at least 95 percent likely that man-made emissions are the main cause of rising temperatures since 1950.
Average global temperatures this year are set to be the hottest in records dating back to the 19th century, beating 2015. ""Even Donald Trump cannot do anything about the laws of physics,"" said Laurence Tubiana, France's climate ambassador.
She told Reuters she was betting ""all countries will stick to the Paris Agreement"" as rising temperatures were damaging the global economy with more heatwaves, floods and droughts.
In Marrakesh, some youth campaigners wept at a demonstration against Trump. The United States is the number two greenhouse gas emitter behind China. 
""This is a dark, dark day,"" said Jesse Bragg, of Corporate Accountability International. ""My heart is absolutely broken,"" said Becky Chung of SustainUS. 
Among statements about climate change, Trump asked in a January 2014 Tweet amid a cold snap: ""Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?""
Overnight, at one Marrakesh hotel, environmentalists and climate scientists huddled around a television expecting a Clinton victory. Their mood descended into silence as the result became clear.
Other renewable shares were also hit. Spain's  Gamesa  (MC:GAM), which is being merged with  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), and Portugal's  EDP Renovaveis  (LS:EDPR) traded 4.3 and 5.4 percent lower, respectively.
Still, many businesses, cities and investors are on track for greener growth.
Stephanie Pfeifer, CEO of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, a European forum for 128 investors with more than 13 trillion euros of assets, said changes towards greener growth were ""irreversible"".
""Renewables have already overtaken coal as a global power source, electric vehicles are the growth segment of the auto industry and jobs are being created in clean energy sectors faster than any other,"" she said.
""Industrial development of renewable energy has reached a stage where it is no longer dependent on political support,"" echoed Tomas Kaberger, executive board chairman of Japan’s Renewable Energy Institute.

""American cities, states, and businesses from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) will continue to drive toward the clean energy future. This election cannot change that,"" said Nathaniel Keohane, of the U.S. Environmental Defense Fund.

110,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2016 08:50AM ET</span>",EU proposes reformed trade defense against Chinese dumping,"By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed on Wednesday a new way to assess whether Chinese manufacturers are exporting products such as steel at unfairly low prices in response to Beijing's demand for change by the end of the year.
The European Union and many of China's other trading partners have been debating whether to grant China ""market economy status"" (MES) from mid-December, which Beijing says is its right 15 years after it joined the World Trade Organization.
For now, China is treated as a special case. EU investigators seeking to pinpoint dumping compare Chinese export prices to those of a third country, such as the United States, rather than to domestic prices in China.
The United States has warned China it has not done enough to qualify for market economy status. Beijing has insisted it be treated like any other WTO member. Not doing so is seen as risking a wave of litigation and a trade war.
EU trade ministers are expected to discuss the new anti-dumping measures at a meeting on Friday along with other plans to modernize the EU's trade defense arsenal.
The Commission's proposal, which would need approval from the 28 member states and the European Parliament to become law, says that in general the normal reference value in dumping cases involving WTO members would be the domestic prices.
However, if there are ""significant distortions"" affecting domestic prices as well, investigators can instead use international benchmark prices.
Such significant distortions primarily relate to state interference, whether directly or indirectly such as public policy leading to cheap finance.
""This does not mean today we say that China is a market economy. It clearly isn't,"" EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told a news conference.
Outside, some 15,000 steel workers marched to demand action to protect the sector. Protection against Chinese dumping is a central demand. Steel has been the focus of recent EU trade action against China, with many steel grades now facing duties.
Aegis Europe, an alliance of 30 European manufacturing industries, said the anti-dumping proposal crucially shifts the burden of proof, meaning EU producers must show such distortions. Under the current regime, it is for Chinese firms to prove they are operating under normal market conditions.
To counter this, the Commission says it will issue reports identifying such distortions in certain countries or certain sectors. EU manufacturers may be able to rely on a report to calculate what the normal reference price should be.

Aegis also said it created legal uncertainty and called for improvements. The conservative EPP group in the European parliament said it was important to ensure the rules were safe from challenges at the WTO.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's election as president raises the prospect the United States will pull out of the nuclear pact it signed last year with Iran, alienating Washington from its allies and potentially freeing Iran to act on its ambitions.
Outgoing President Barack Obama's administration touted the deal, a legacy foreign policy achievement, as a way to suspend Tehran's suspected drive to develop atomic weapons. In return Obama, a Democrat, agreed to a lifting of most sanctions.
The deal, harshly opposed by Republicans in Congress, was reached as a political commitment rather than a treaty ratified by lawmakers, making it vulnerable to a new U.S. president, such as Trump, who might disagree with its terms.
A Republican, Trump ran for the White House opposing the deal but contradictory statements made it unclear how he would act. In an upset over Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump won on Tuesday and will succeed Obama on Jan. 20.
A businessman-turned-politician who has never held public office, Trump called the nuclear pact a ""disaster"" and ""the worst deal ever negotiated"" during his campaign and said it could lead to a ""nuclear holocaust."" 
In a speech to the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC in March, Trump declared that his “Number-One priority” would be to “dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.” 
He said he would have negotiated a better deal, with longer restrictions, but somewhat paradoxically, he criticized remaining U.S. sanctions that prevent American companies from dealing with Iran.
By contrast, he has conceded it would be hard to destroy a deal enshrined in a United Nations resolution. In August 2015, he said he would not “rip up” the nuclear deal, but that he would “police that contract so tough they don’t have a chance.”
Iran denies ever having considered developing atomic weapons. But experts said any U.S. violation of the deal would allow Iran also to pull back from its commitments to curb nuclear development. 
Those commitments include reducing the number of its centrifuges by two-thirds, capping its level of uranium enrichment well below the level needed for bomb-grade material, reducing its enriched uranium stockpile from around 10,000 kg to 300 kg for 15 years, and submitting to international inspections to verify its compliance.
'DIVISIVE DEAL'
“Say goodbye to the Iran deal,” said Richard Nephew, a former U.S. negotiator with Iran now at Columbia University.
“There is very little likelihood that it stays, either because of a deliberate decision to tear it up by Trump, or steps that the U.S. takes which prompt an Iranian walk back.”
The spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Behrouz Kamalvandi, was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency: ""Iran is prepared for any change,"" adding that Iran would try to stand by the deal.
The nuclear deal was divisive in Iran, with hardliners opposed to better relations with the West arguing that pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani was giving up too much of the country’s nuclear infrastructure for too little relief.
Rouhani said on Wednesday the U.S. election results would have no effect on Tehran's policies, state news agency IRNA quoted him as saying. [nL8N1DA46H]
Some of Washington’s closest Middle East allies have been skeptical of the nuclear deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been outright hostile. Gulf leaders say the deal has emboldened Iran's pursuit of regional hegemony in part through support for proxy groups fueling regional conflicts.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, whose power supersedes that of Rouhani, regularly criticizes the United States and says it should not be trusted, but ultimately assented to the terms of the deal, known by its acronym JCPOA.
KHAMENEI BIG WINNER
“The big winner in the aftermath of a Trump victory is Iran’s Supreme Leader,” said Suzanne Maloney, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution.
“He will have the most cartoonish American enemy, he will exult in the (hopefully brief) crash of the American economy, and he will be able to walk away from Iran’s obligations under the JCPOA while pinning the responsibility on Washington.”
Further complicating any Trump effort to renegotiate the deal is that it is a multilateral agreement involving U.S. allies in Europe as well as fellow world powers Russia and China. European and Asian firms have been returning to Iran and making major investments there, meaning the United States would likely be alone in pulling out of the deal, possibly isolating it from its partners.
On Wednesday, the head of gas, renewables and power for French oil and gas company Total TOTF.PA in Iran said Trump's election would have no impact on investments [nP6N1CW004].
Khamenei has already promised to “set fire” to the nuclear deal if the West violates it. Iran has repeatedly complained it has not received benefits promised. Though European companies have been eager to explore business prospects in Iran, few deals have been enacted in part because European banks have been reluctant to finance deals involving Iran.
“As to whether he can negotiate a ‘better’ deal, it takes two (or seven) sides to agree to begin that process, something I rate as highly unlikely,” said Zachary Goldman, executive director of the Center on Law and Security at New York University and a former U.S. Treasury official.

“And if we walk away from the deal I think we will be in the worst of all worlds - Iran will feel freed from its commitments and we may be blamed for the deal falling apart.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil reversed early losses of almost 4 percent to trade above $46 a barrel on Wednesday, as the market recovered from an initial Brexit-like reaction to Donald Trump's surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election.
The result sparked a flight from risky assets in a move analysts compared to June's referendum in which Britons voted to leave the European Union. But the dollar steadied and European stocks pared losses, with traders citing what some saw as a conciliatory speech by Trump following his win.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was up seven cents at $46.11 a barrel by 0625 ET, after falling to $44.40, the lowest since Aug. 11. U.S. crude (CLc1) gained 1 cent to $44.99.
Trump's victory may have some implications supportive of oil prices, analysts said. For one, he has criticized the West's nuclear deal with Iran, an accord that has allowed Tehran to increase crude exports sharply this year.
""There are a lot of unknowns about what will be the Trump position in the geopolitics of the Middle East,"" said Olivier Jakob, analyst at consultancy Petromatrix. 
""President Obama from the start of his election worked towards a detente with Iran and we can't be sure that President Trump will continue in the same direction.""
Iran on Wednesday said Trump should stay committed to the deal.
Oil prices are less than half of their level of mid-2014, pressured by excess supplies.
The election result could compound the supply-side headwinds that oil producers face with demand concerns, said Daniel Yergin, vice-chairman of analysis firm IHS Markit and author of The Prize, a well known history of the oil industry.
""The outcome of the U.S. election adds to the challenges for the oil exporters because it likely leads to weaker economic growth in an already fragile global economy,"" he said. ""And that means additional pressure on oil demand.""
In an attempt to boost prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed in September to cut output, although investor doubts have grown that it will be able to implement the deal at its next meeting on Nov. 30. 
A report by industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. crude inventories rising by 4.4 million barrels last week, weighing on oil. That would be more than the 1.3-million-barrel increase analysts expected. 

The U.S. government's official supply report is due for release later on Wednesday .

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC's job of trying to prop up oil prices has just got much harder.
With Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential election, the 14-country oil-producing cartel may have to battle a sourer outlook for the global economy and weaker demand for crude.
It also faces the prospect of increased U.S. oil output - a major bugbear for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries - given Trump's pledge to open all federal land and waters for fossil fuel exploration.
OPEC's internal dynamic could change, with Trump promising to tighten policies on Iran just as oil companies begin slowly to return to the Islamic Republic.
""Buckle up your seatbelts for a more turbulent and uncertain global economy that is ahead,"" Pulitzer Prize-winning U.S. oil historian Daniel Yergin, vice-chairman of the IHS Markit think tank, told Reuters. 
""The outcome of the U.S. election adds to the challenges for the oil exporters because it will likely lead to weaker economic growth in an already fragile global economy. And that means additional pressure on oil demand,"" Yergin said.
Oil prices fell almost 4 percent early on Wednesday but recovered to trade up slightly at around $46 per barrel by 1055 GMT (LCOc1) [O/R]. 
OPEC will meet on Nov. 30 in an effort to curtail output and reduce the global oil glut that has seen prices more than halve since 2014.
OPEC sources said they expected oil to remain weak in the days and weeks ahead due to worries about the global economy and uncertainty about Trump's policies for the Middle East.
""Oil is doomed,"" one of the sources said.
A second source said the OPEC meeting in November might fail to have a strong impact on prices even if it strikes a deal to limit output: ""I don’t think prices will go up much more than the current levels.""
Trump has promised to double U.S. economic growth but also pledged protectionist trade policies.
""This will have huge negative implications for Asia, given how much their GDP is tied to trade with the U.S. Hence it is negative for growth and oil demand, at least due to the uncertainty that Trump creates,"" said Amrita Sen, of the think tank Energy Aspects.
Trump's energy policies have been limited in detail so far.
But what he has said will be seen as supportive for the share prices of U.S. independent oil and gas producers as well as oil majors with large exposure to the U.S. shale industry such as  Chevron  (N:CVX), ExxonMobil (N:XOM) and Shell (L:RDSa).
""Trump has vowed to lead a fossil-fuel revival to underpin job growth and has also put man-made climate change denial at the forefront of his energy policy,"" JBC Energy analysts said in a note.
Trump said he was in favor of removing oil-sector regulations, opening federal land to drilling, and vowed to revive a major trans-Canadian and trans-U.S. oil pipeline project while pledging to support the coal industry.
The stocks of oil majors  BP  (L:BP) and Shell were down in line with the price of crude, while France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) underperformed peers.
Earlier this week, Total signed a deal with Iran to help it develop a huge gas field, becoming the first Western energy company to ink a major deal with Tehran since the lifting of international sanctions this year.
Trump has criticized the West's nuclear deal with Iran, adding to uncertainty and frustrating Tehran's push for foreign investment to revive its economy.
An executive from an oil major negotiating with Iran said that given Tehran wanted to repay investments slowly, maybe over five to 10 years, many oil firms would take a slow approach in finalizing deals until Trump's policies became clearer.

""It is a significant amount of money that will be put at risk should sanctions be brought back,"" the executive said.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its weekly report on oil supplies at 10:30AM ET (14:30GMT), amid analyst expectations for an increase of 1.3 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories are expected to fall by 1.0 million barrels while stocks of distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, are forecast to drop by 2.1 million barrels.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories increased by 4.4 million barrels in the week ended November 4, well above market expectations.
The API report also showed a decline of 3.6 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillates showed a drop of 4.3 million barrels on the week.
Meanwhile, oil traders continued to weigh prospects of a coordinated production cut among major global oil producers.
OPEC reached an agreement to cap output to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held in Algeria in late September. However, the 14-member oil group said it won’t finalize details on individual output quotas until its next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.
The possibility that producers could walk away empty-handed from the November meeting looms large after Iraq, Iran, Nigeria and Libya all signaled they might not take part in the proposed production cut deal. Russia’s unclear stance is also fueling uncertainty.

Philippe Sauquet told journalist on the sidelines of an energy summit in Paris that a heads of agreement signed by Total earlier this week would not be impacted by the Trump's election.
Trump has called last year's deal ending a diplomatic standoff between Iran and six world powers over the country's nuclear policy and opening the way for western investment ""the worst deal ever negotiated,"" although he has also conceded it would be hard to rip up a deal enshrined in a U.N. resolution. 
""We have always said that we are interested in returning to Iran on condition that the investments that are proposed to us are sufficiently attractive and knowing that for us, it was out of the question to do anything that would contravene international rules,"" Sauquet told reporters. 
""The election that took place in the United States does not change anything,"" Sauquet said.

Total on Tuesday, became the first western energy company to sign a major deal with Tehran since the lifting of international sanctions earlier this year.

Republican candidate Donald Trump has been elected 45th president of the United States on Wednesday, shattering expectations for a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton.
CNN and NBC reported that Clinton called Trump to concede the presidency.
Trump clinched victories in the key battleground states of Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.
Republicans were expected to remain in control of the U.S. House of Representatives, and were also on track to defend their Senate majority, although the Senate majority narrowed.
Global stock markets crashed on the news, the U.S. dollar tumbled over 1% to a one-month low against the other major currencies, while the Mexican peso plummeted to record lows, with MXN/USD down more than 8%.

MANILA/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Gold jumped nearly 4 percent on Wednesday to its strongest in more than five weeks as investors sought safe havens with Republican Donald Trump leading Democrat Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House.
It marked gold's biggest single-day gain since June when it rose as much as 8 percent when Britain decided to leave the European Union.
Trump won the key battleground state of Ohio and led Clinton in a series of other states that were too close to call, including Florida and North Carolina.
Trump is leading Clinton by 36 Electoral College votes, as of 10:35 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (0335 GMT on Wednesday), according to media reports.
Spot gold  rose as far as $1,323.10, its strongest since Sept. 30, and was trading up 3.2 percent at $1,315.84 by 0341 GMT.
If Trump wins ""there's more uncertainty in his platform and the direction that his policy may aim, so there may be more volatility with risk assets and over the short-term you may have investors flock to gold,"" said Mark Watkins, regional investment manager with The Private Client Group of U.S. Bank.
The U.S. dollar sank and stock markets slammed into reverse in wild trade as investors faced the real possibility of a shock win by Trump that could upend the global political order. Sovereign bonds shot higher while the Mexican peso went into near freefall. [MKTS/GLOB]
U.S. gold for December delivery  was last up 3.3 percent at $1,317.30 an ounce, after earlier hitting $1,324.30.
Spot silver  rose as far as $18.84 an ounce and was last up 1.9 percent at $18.69. 
U.S. rates futures imply traders see only 36 percent chance of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates next month, which should support further gains in gold.
""The market turbulence that a Trump victory looks likely to bring will deter the Fed from hiking next month,"" said Craig Erlam, analyst at Oanda.
""Given that markets have strongly priced in a hike, I think we would see a significant repricing over the coming days, with odds falling dramatically from above 80 percent where it stood yesterday.""

Natural gas for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange tumbled 13.2 cents, or 4.69%, to $2.684 per million British thermal units by 10:35AM ET (15:35GMT), after sliding to $2.671 in early trade.
Updated weather forecasting models showed that high pressure weather systems will dominate over the central and southern U.S. this week, resulting in much warmer than normal conditions.
Overall, demand for natural gas will be much lighter than normal with the lack of subfreezing temperatures across the eastern U.S. and the Great Lakes-region.
Natural gas futures are down almost 12% so far this month as warmer-than-average weather in key gas-consuming regions in the U.S. ignited speculation that a mild winter will curtail demand for the heating fuel and leave a glut of it in storage, weighing on prices next year.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather reduces demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
Meanwhile, market participants awaited weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 51 and 61 billion cubic feet in the week ended November 4.
That compares with a gain of 54 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 54 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 38 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.963 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 1.2% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 4.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Tuesday, paring earlier gains as voting in the U.S. presidential election got under way, in line with a retreat in U.S. stock index futures and a pickup in the dollar. 
In a swell of investor risk appetite, U.S. stocks racked up their biggest one-day gain since March on Monday, but this boost, which lifted oil, copper and European equities earlier on Tuesday faded.
The most recent polls have put Democrat Hillary Clinton ahead of Republican rival Donald Trump in Tuesday's election. Clinton is seen by investors as offering greater certainty and stability.
Brent January crude oil futures were down 37 cents at $45.78 a barrel by 1437 GMT, off a session peak of $46.69. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 34 cents to $44.55, after the U.S. dollar pared losses and S&P futures surrendered gains.
""Seeing oil coming off today, that's more reflective of the equity futures in the U.S. coming off the highs and European stocks coming off,"" CMC Markets analyst Jasper Lawler said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries forecast demand for its oil will rise in the next three years, suggesting its 2014 decision to let prices fall to curb costlier rival supplies is delivering higher market share. [OPEC/M]
""OPEC raising its forecasts, ordinarily a positive, but we're all obviously election-focussed ... so I don’t think that's driving (oil) as much as it normally would,"" Lawler said.
The group meets on Nov. 30 and has pledged to reach a deal on cutting output to try to erode a two-year-old global surplus.
But a series of member states asking to be exempt from any deal, along with questions over the likelihood of non-OPEC rival Russia joining in, have created doubt over OPEC's ability to deliver a meaningful cut.
""The emerging sense of disappointment surrounding the OPEC meeting in three weeks’ time is likely to prompt further financial investors to jettison their long positions, too,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
Mohammed Barkindo, secretary-general of OPEC, warned on Tuesday that failure to implement the agreement reached in Algiers in September to cut output would bring negative consequences to an already fragile oil industry.

In physical oil markets, U.S. pipeline companies with operations at the heart of the country's commercial oil industry at Cushing, Oklahoma, restarted on Monday after an earthquake triggered safety shutdowns.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's Total has signed a deal with Iran to further develop its part of the world's largest gas field, becoming the first western energy company to sign a major deal with Tehran since the lifting of international sanctions earlier this year.
Total confirmed on Tuesday it had signed a heads of agreement with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the Phase 11 development of South Pars in the Gulf, which extends into Qatari waters where it is known as the North field.
The SP11 project will progress in two stages, the first costing an estimated $2 billion, Total said. The produced gas will be fed into Iran's gas network.
The French company has already played a key role in Iran's energy industry, including the development of phases 2 and 3 of South Pars in the 2000s, before pulling out of the country after international sanctions were imposed in 2010.
Foreign companies keen to tap into Iran's vast oil and gas reserves have so far made little inroads into the country despite the lifting of many sanctions earlier this year following a landmark agreement on Iran's nuclear program.
Tehran has pledged to open up its oil industry but foreign companies, including  BP  (LON:BP) and Italy's Eni recently said they still have little information about Iranian oil fields and contract terms, hindering investment decisions.
Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne, who has taken some major investment decisions in recent years despite one of the sector's longest downturns, said the agreement ""resulted in an attractive commercial framework.""
Total said it would operate the SP11 project and have a 50.1 percent stake in it. Petropars, a subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company, will have a 19.9 percent stake while state-China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) [CNPET.UL] will have a 30 percent stake.
The development will have a production capacity of 1.8 billion cubic feet per day, or 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent, with output to be fed into Iran's gas network.
""This project fits with the group's strategy of expanding its presence in the Middle East, where the origins of the group lie, and growing its gas portfolio by adding low unit cost, long plateau gas assets,"" Pouyanne said in a statement. 

Total will develop the project in compliance with national and international laws and the investment will be undertaken without bank finance, he told reporters.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2016 01:41PM ET</span>","Saudi oil shipments to Egypt halted indefinitely, Egyptian officials say","CAIRO/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has informed Egypt that shipments of oil products expected under a $23 billion aid deal have been halted indefinitely, suggesting a deepening rift between the Arab world's richest country and its most populous.
Saudi Arabia has been a major donor to Egypt since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi seized power in mid-2013 but Riyadh has become frustrated with Sisi's lack of economic reforms and his reluctance to be drawn into the conflict in Yemen.
During a visit by Saudi King Salman in April, Saudi Arabia agreed to provide Egypt with 700,000 tonnes of refined oil products per month for five years but the cargoes stopped arriving in early October as festering political tensions burst into the open.
Egyptian officials have said since that the contract with Saudi Arabia's state oil firm Aramco remains valid and had appeared to expect that oil would start flowing again soon. 
On Monday, however, Egyptian Oil Minister Tarek El Molla confirmed it had stopped shipments indefinitely. Aramco has not commented on the halt and did not respond to calls on Monday.
""They did not give us a reason,"" an oil ministry official told Reuters. ""They only informed the authority about halting shipments of petroleum products until further notice.""
The move comes as a source in Molla's delegation said late on Sunday evening that he would visit Iran, Saudi Arabia's main political rival, to try to strike new oil deals.
Egypt and Iran's diplomatic relations have been strained since the 1970s. An Egyptian official visiting Iran would cement a break in its alliance with Saudi Arabia and mark a seismic shift in the regional political order.
Speaking to reporters in Abu Dhabi, Molla said he was not going to Iran. An Iranian oil official later said that a report by the semi-official Mehr news agency suggesting Molla would meet his Iranian counterpart in Tehran on Monday was ""incorrect"". 
Egyptian Prime Minister Sherif Ismail also said Molla was not visiting Iran and Egypt was not negotiating with Tehran over importing oil products, state newspaper al-Ahram reported.
But two security sources and the source in Molla's delegation said the minister had been scheduled to go, and the low-key visit was now delayed after the news became public. 
Gulf Arab countries, led by Saudi Arabia, have pumped billions of dollars into Egypt's flagging economy since former general Sisi took over after a year of divisive rule by the Muslim Brotherhood.
But with the Brotherhood threat diminished, Gulf rulers have grown disillusioned at what they consider Sisi's inability to reform an economy that has become a black hole for aid, and his reluctance to back them on the regional stage.
Egypt has been reluctant to provide military backing for Riyadh's war against the Iranian-backed Houthi group in Yemen. 
In Syria, where Saudi Arabia is a leading backer of rebels fighting against Iranian-backed Bashar al-Assad, Sisi has supported Russia's decision to bomb in support of the president.

A deal to hand over two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, made at the same time as the oil aid agreement, has faced legal challenges and is now bogged down in an Egyptian court.

140,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2016 01:00PM ET</span>","Bashneft stops sending oil to Hungary, Slovakia via Druzhba pipeline - sources","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Bashneft (MM:BANE) has stopped sending oil to Hungary and Slovakia through the Druzhba pipeline, three industry sources said, in what traders believe reflects a change in marketing strategy under Bashneft's new owner Rosneft .
Bashneft had an export quota of 525,000 tonnes via the Druzhba pipeline to Slovakia and Hungary in October-December 2016. In October, it shipped around 180,000 tonnes of oil in line with the export schedule, traders said.
Bashneft has exported oil through the pipeline for the last four years, selling it via Belize-based trading firm Normeston under a long-term contract.
But since the start of November, Bashneft has stopped sending oil to Slovakia and Hungary via the Druzhba pipeline, industry sources said.
Traders believe the cut-off is related to changes Rosneft has made to Bashneft's trading practices and export destinations since the state-controlled Russian energy major acquired a controlling stake in Bashneft last month.
Rosneft paid 330 billion roubles ($5.2 billion) for a 50.1 percent stake in Bashneft and is now seeking government approval to buy up to 100 percent of Bashneft.
Traders believe that Bashneft will now stop trading its crude oil via Normeston as Rosneft's management favors direct contracts with end-users.
Traders think that Rosneft diverted Bashneft oil intended for Slovakia and Hungary to the ports. Rosneft and Bashneft each got extra positions in the November loading plan as of the start of last week. 
Rosneft did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. Hungarian energy company MOL is the only end buyer of crude oil from Russia delivered to Hungary and Slovakia.
Apart from Bashneft, Lukoil, Russneft and small independent Russian producers supply crude oil to Hungary and Slovakia. MOL also imports various Mediterranean grades via the port of Omisalj.
Traders saw no political overtones to the decision to stop sending oil via the pipeline and believe Hungary and Slokavia should easily be able to make up for the shortfall in oil imports by buying more from its main supplier - Lukoil.
Moscow has in the past used energy supplies as a political and economic tool, responding to natural gas price disputes with Ukraine for example by cutting off supplies, affecting its European clients further down its pipelines. 

With tensions between Russia and Ukraine running high since Moscow's seizure of Crimea in March 2014, Ukraine has increased its ability to import gas from EU countries such as Slovakia and Hungary.

Natural gas for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 4.9 cents, or 1.77%, to $2.816 per million British thermal units by 10:20AM ET (15:20GMT), after jumping to $2.876 in early trade.
Updated weather forecasting models revealed that a strong cold blast with rain and snow will arrive into the eastern U.S. by next week for the first relatively cold Fall-like weather system this year.
Natural gas futures lost nearly 11% last week as warmer-than-average weather in key gas-consuming regions in the U.S. ignited speculation that a mild winter will curtail demand for the heating fuel and leave a glut of it in storage, weighing on prices next year.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather reduces demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
Meanwhile, market participants awaited weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 51 and 61 billion cubic feet in the week ended November 4.

OPEC reached an agreement to cap output to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held in Algeria in late September with details on individual quotas to be finalized at the next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.
These analysts insisted in a note to clients that “poor fundamentals don’t prevent headline-related price reversals.” 
They noted that “OPEC can still spook markets” and has been “adept at talking up declining markets”. 
“The group has repeatedly made bullish announcements about OPEC intervention during periods of low liquidity (e.g. US holidays), and whenever short positions become large,” they explained.
Though Morgan Stanley admitted that skepticism of OPEC’s capability to follow through is warranted, the broker warned that prices still move on these headlines.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose more than 1 percent on Monday, boosted by a commitment from OPEC to stick to a deal to cut output, but prices remained more than $7 below last month's high due to persistent doubts over the feasibility of the group's plan.

""Market belief that OPEC can reach a credible deal has collapsed and prices are now $8 a barrel off the post-Algiers highs,"" David Hufton, managing director of PVM Oil Associates, said in a note. 
He cited record OPEC production in October, infighting between Iran and Saudi Arabia, as well as calls from Iraq for its own exemption from any cut.
""The numbers show that the best deal OPEC are likely to come up with is well short of what is needed to achieve a balanced market in 2017,"" Hufton said. 
Oil futures posted their biggest weekly percentage decline since January last week with Brent falling as low as $45.08, its weakest since Aug. 11, and WTI hitting $43.57, its lowest since Sept. 20.
There are also risks that the oil glut, which has dogged markets for over two years, could continue as OPEC's de-facto leader Saudi Arabia threatened to increase production.
Even if Saudi Arabia does not follow through on that threat, its exports could rise.
""Saudi local oil demand is falling, and just maintaining current output could imply higher exports,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) bank said.

There were also signs of rising future U.S. output as the number of drilling rigs looking for new oil rose by nine to 450 in the week to Nov. 4, the highest level since February.

The news lifted a cloud over Clinton's presidential campaign just two days before the U.S. election and possibly blunted momentum for rival Donald Trump.

The possibility that producers could walk away empty-handed from the November meeting looms large after Iraq, Iran, Nigeria and Libya all signaled they might not take part in the proposed production cut deal. Russia’s unclear stance is also fueling uncertainty.

The development comes after lawyers for four U.S. steel producers said in September that they would file petitions with the department alleging that Chinese competitors diverted shipments to Vietnam immediately after the U.S. government set preliminary anti-dumping duties on their stainless steel.
The U.S. duties, ranging from 63.86 percent to 76.64 percent, were proposed after preliminary findings showed the imports were being dumped in the U.S. market at below fair value.
The U.S. firms alleged the Chinese steel was modified to be corrosion-resistant and then sent to the United States at Vietnam's U.S. tariff rate, which is lower than for China.
The newspaper said the heart of the issue is whether the steel is modified enough to be a new product made in Vietnam.
The newspaper said a spokesman for the department declined to comment on its story. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters on Sunday.

The U.S. firms that were petitioning the department include ArcelorMittal USA,  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE), AK Steel Holdings Corp (N:AKS) and United States Steel Corp (N:X)

After that suspension, Egypt voted in favor of a Russian-backed U.N. resolution on Syria in October that excluded calls to stop bombing Aleppo, which Saudi Arabia strongly opposed.
Saudi Arabia has showered Egypt with billions of dollars in aid since 2013, when President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ousted elected Mohammed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood and banned the Islamist movement, which Riyadh opposes.
The Saudi deal was for 700,000 tonnes of oil products a month for five years under a $23 billion deal between Saudi Aramco and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) to be paid off over 15 years. 
Molla is set to meet several senior Iranian officials to discuss the possibility of securing oil supplies from Tehran, one source, who accompanied Molla to the airport, said.
His visit to Iran, Saudi Arabia's main regional rival, may signal a further rift between Egypt and its top benefactor.
Molla said last month it was unclear when the Saudi oil deliveries would resume and Saudi Arabia has provided no reason for their suspension.
Egypt has since worked to secure new energy sources, signing a memorandum of understanding last week with Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR for up to 2 million barrels of crude oil.
The EGPC last week signed a farm-out agreement with Kuwait Energy Plc giving Egypt's state oil buyer a 20-percent participating interest in its Siba field in Iraq. 

Egypt and Iran have had strained diplomatic ties since the late 1970s and an Egyptian official visiting Tehran is a rarity.

157,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2016 01:38PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudis could raise oil output again as sparring with Iran returns - sources,"By Rania El Gamal, Alex Lawler and Dmitry Zhdannikov
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Old disputes between Saudi Arabia and rival Iran resurfaced at a meeting of OPEC experts last week, with Riyadh saying it could raise oil output steeply to bring prices down if Tehran refuses to limit its supply, OPEC sources say.
Clashes between the two OPEC heavyweights, which are fighting proxy wars in Syria and Yemen, have become frequent in recent years.
Tensions subsided, however, in recent months after Saudi Arabia agreed to support a global oil supply limiting pact, thus raising the prospect that OPEC would take steps to boost oil prices.
But a meeting of OPEC experts last week, designed to work out details of cuts for the next OPEC ministerial gathering on Nov. 30, saw Saudis and Iranian clashing again, according to five OPEC sources who were present at the meeting and spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
""The Saudis have threatened to raise their production to 11 million barrels per day and even 12 million bpd, bringing oil prices down, and to withdraw from the meeting,"" one OPEC source who attended the meeting told Reuters.
OPEC headquarters declined to comment on discussions during the closed-door meetings last week. Saudi and Iranian OPEC delegates also declined official comments.
A senior Gulf OPEC source said Saudi Arabia did not say output will rise, rather that it ""could"" rise.
""Saudi doesn't threat, Saudi Arabia doesn't produce more than the customers need,"" the source said. ""All oil producers could raise their production if there was no agreement, this is a fact.""
Oil prices fell on Friday. Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 77 cents at $45.58 a barrel as of 1249 ET.
Saudi Arabia has increased output since 2014 to record highs of around 10.5 million-10.7 million barrels per day and adding extra supply would only worsen the global glut, which has already seen prices more than halving from $115 a barrel since mid-2014.
The Saudi stance followed objections by Iran, which said it was unwilling to freeze its output, the same OPEC sources said. Iran has argued it should be exempt from such limits as its production recovers after the lifting of EU sanctions.
Riyadh's position will revive memories of a pump war that it embarked on at the end of 2014 to claw market share back from higher-cost producers. Iran along with other OPEC price hawks have severely criticized the Saudi strategy.
Riyadh has softened its stance since the appointment of Khalid al-Falih as energy minister in May this year.
In September, OPEC agreed at a meeting in Algeria on modest preliminary oil output cuts in the first such deal since 2008, with special conditions given to Libya, Nigeria and Iran, whose output has been hit by wars and sanctions.
A new rise in tensions observed during the meeting of experts last week highlights the fragile nature of OPEC agreements. The group has a long way to go before it turns its preliminary Algerian accord into a real deal.
The Saudi comments on raising output came as a surprise even to Riyadh's Gulf OPEC allies, sources who attended the meeting of experts on Oct. 28 said.
One source said the Saudi OPEC delegation has asked to call off the next day's meeting with non-OPEC producers, including Russia, on Oct. 29 since Iran was objecting to a deal. But they were convinced by other members to attend it in order not to embarrass the group.
""We felt as if they (the Saudis) wanted the meeting to fail,"" said a third, non-Iranian OPEC source.
""WAR FRONT""
The Saudi OPEC delegation told their Iranian counterparts that Tehran should freeze output at 3.66 million bpd - the latest estimates of Iranian output by OPEC experts, known as secondary sources.
Iran has reported its output at 3.85 million bpd in September and said it would only cap its output at 12.7 percent of OPEC's total ceiling - or 4.2 million bpd.
Iran's counter-argument at the meeting was that Saudi Arabia has raised its output by almost 1 million bpd since 2014, and is now trying to convince others it would cut output by 400,000 bpd to get a deal, though in reality Riyadh has already won extra production and revenue, according to OPEC sources.
Iranian comments after meeting to domestic media indicated tensions were high. 
""Working in oil industry is like operating at war fronts and we have to preserve our trenches by raising our production capacity as much as we can,"" Ali Kardor, managing director of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), told the oil ministry's news agency Shana.
""The next OPEC meeting is near and we will never cease to recapture our quota in the organization,"" he said on Monday, adding that Iran's crude oil output was nearing 4 million bpd.
OPEC sources have said Saudi Arabia offered to reduce its output from summer peaks of 10.7 million bpd to about 10.2 million if Iran agreed to freeze production at around levels of 3.6 million-3.7 million bpd.
The Saturday meeting with non-OPEC producers went ahead though they made no specific commitment.
The High Level Committee of experts will meet again in Vienna on Nov. 25 to finalize the details ahead of the next meeting of OPEC ministers on Nov. 30.
OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo has said he is ""optimistic"" a final agreement will be reached.
An OPEC delegate, who attended Friday's meeting, said he still hoped for a deal in November.

""People can look at it from different angles. The fact that discussions are still going on is a positive one. They are going to work on it, close to the ministers’ meeting,"" the delegate said.

158,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2016 08:30AM ET</span>",Brazil could pay Petrobras up to $20 billion over rights: paper,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - State-run oil company Petrobras could receive as much as $20 billion from the Brazilian government as compensation for a fall in oil prices since the purchase of offshore drilling rights in 2010, newspaper Folha de S. Paulo said on Friday.
Petróleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, said in a securities filing that no decision had yet been made regarding a review of some of its oil and gas drilling prerogatives in the so called Transfer of Rights Area.
Petrobras paid the government $54 billion to purchase the rights in 2010 without competitive bidding. Terms of the sale included a renegotiation after five years. 
The amount to be paid will be determined by independent experts hired by Petrobras and government regulatory agency ANP, Petrobras said in the filing.
Many analysts had been concerned that Petrobras would have to pay the government billions of dollars to hang on to the rights, which lie in Brazil's offshore subsalt region where vast deposits of oil and gas lie beneath a layer of salt. 
However, Petrobras Chief Executive Pedro Parente told Reuters in late September he believed the government will end up owing Petrobras instead..
The reasoning is that price of oil has plunged since 2010, making the drilling rights area less valuable.
The government is the controlling shareholder in Petrobras.
Petrobras and the government expect to conclude the renegotiation by the end of the year, Folha said, citing unidentified sources.
One government condition is that Petrobras use part of the money it receives to pay overdue taxes, Folha said. The newspaper added that the government could offer Petrobras rights to explore other offshore areas for a portion of the payment.
The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the report. 

Petrobras, the world's most indebted oil company, accounts for about 10 percent of Brazil's economic output.

The 300-page book, titled ""Out of the Desert"" and published by Portfolio Penguin, describes the battles waged by the influential industry veteran including fending off Western attempts to gain control of oil giant Aramco's best assets. 
Naimi joined Aramco as a teenager in 1947 and climbed through the ranks to become company chief from 1983 to 1995, when he was named minister of petroleum - a post he retained until his retirement this year. 
His career spans the rise of the ""petro-politics"" that defined the recent history of the kingdom, including the birth of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1969 and the oil embargo in 1973.
Even though the book holds back from detailing any political jostling within the secretive Saudi royal family and government, it gives a clear idea that various factions have often pushed for different paths for Saudi Aramco.
Naimi describes several instances throughout his career when he fought top executives from Western companies including U.S. giant  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) trying what he describes as winning lucrative deals via good connections with some Saudi officials.
""They (Exxon) wanted us to turn over highly restricted information about our Ghawar field, for instance, that isn't even known within the kingdom outside of the oil ministry and Saudi Aramco,"" Naimi writes about gas talks between oil majors and Aramco at the end of the 1990s.
If Aramco does list its stock as planned in 2018, investors would expect the firm to disclose classified information on its reserves, including Ghawar - Saudi Arabia's biggest oilfield.
But it could avoid doing so given the sensitivity of the issue and just say that by buying into Aramco, investors would gain access to the world's cheapest reserves, still controlled by the state, according to sources briefed on the offering.
Naimi retired in April and was replaced by Aramco chairman Khalid al-Falih as energy minister. 
The Saudi oil portfolio is overseen by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 31, who has been actively promoting the Aramco IPO.
Sources in the kingdom have suggested the royal family is far from united on the issue as some see the offering as giving away the crown jewels cheaply to foreigners at a time of low oil prices.
Naimi says he fought hard for ""the heart and soul"" of Aramco to avoid giving Westerners unnecessarily lucrative deals.
""(Exxon's then-boss) Lee Raymond for instance was trying to make the most of his relationship with (the foreign minister at the time) Prince Saud al-Faisal to get a better deal for ExxonMobil,"" Naimi writes.
Naimi says he was convinced that as part of gas talks in the 1990s, Exxon and other oil majors hoped to acquire cheap Saudi reserves of gas condensate, a high-quality form of crude oil.
""I told Lee Raymond my views and that I felt he was trying to gain an unfair advantage. Lee responded in kind and it got a little ugly. From that point onward our negotiations were over. I haven't seen Lee Raymond since, which was a shame because we were once good friends,"" Naimi continues.
Naimi effectively won the battle, as Aramco offered to oil majors pure upstream gas exploration contracts without gas condensate and only Shell (LON:RDSa) and Total entered into a deal.
A similar fight happened a few years earlier when Naimi says Shell, Mobil and Total tried to persuade his predecessor, oil minister Hisham Nazer, to allow them to develop the Shaybah oilfield for what Naimi saw as an overly expensive contract.
Naimi even says Francois Mitterrand, France's then-president, was convinced that King Fahd had promised him the field in exchange for French participation in the first Gulf War.
Again, Naimi fought against the idea as the companies became ""greedy"".
He cites praise from his successor, Falih: ""By holding his ground, minister al-Naimi was not necessarily protecting Saudi Aramco, he was protecting the kingdom from having substantial value drained away in those transactions.""
As Aramco's IPO draws nearer, the issue of value drain will become increasingly relevant.

To cite Naimi: ""When the camel goes down, many knives come out. That is an old Arabic proverb. In the mid-1980s the camel was Aramco, the knives were the vested interest of Saudis who viewed us as a symbol of foreign influence and the era of colonialism.""

162,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2016 06:20AM ET</span>","Battered U.S. coal industry hopes for Trump, prepares for Clinton","By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has won over the U.S. coal industry by promising to revive the downtrodden sector and scrap regulations if elected. 
But the industry has a Plan B if the New York businessman loses to his more green-minded Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on Tuesday: carbon capture and storage, a technology that captures carbon dioxide from burning coal and injects it underground, where many scientists are optimistic it cannot contribute to global warming.
Coal backers see CCS as a politically feasible solution that could help the next president thread the needle between environmentalists and a once-powerful business that is in desperate need of a lifeline. They have been pushing both major party candidates to embrace it.
Staff at the National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative held separate teleconferences with the Clinton and Trump campaigns in August on the merits of a bill that would extend and raise tax breaks for coal and other fossil fuel companies doing CCS in oilfields, from $10 per ton of carbon stored to $35 a ton. NEORI is made up of diverse groups ranging from environmental ogranizations to some of the country's largest coal companies.
Weeks after the teleconference, Clinton announced her support for the bipartisan CCS bill. Nearly 20 of 100 senators, including Clinton's vice presidential running mate Tim Kaine, also back it and expect it to gain momentum. 
Trump has not given a position on the bill, but a senior policy adviser to Trump's campaign, Dan Kowalski, said he ""supports all sources of American energy. This includes clean coal and research into new coal technologies."" 
""My sense is Clinton recognizes that, especially in certain parts of the country, coal-based energy and other fossil fuels provide some of the highest-paying jobs in our economy,” said Brad Crabtree, of the Great Plains Institute, a policy group that pushes for the deployment technologies to reduce fossil fuel emissions, and the parent organization of NEORI.
Oil drillers have used CCS since the 1970s, pumping carbon dioxide into aging reservoirs to force out remaining crude. Coal advocates want to expand CCS to coal-fueled power plants. But the business is expensive and needs incentives.
TRUMP'S PLEDGE, CLINTON'S PRAGMATISM
Trump's anti-regulation stance has made him a clear favorite of the industry, because it suggests lower costs and risks for major producers like Arch Coal Inc, Peabody Energy Corp, Cloud Peak Energy Inc and Alpha Natural Resources Inc.
The sector has given about $223,000 in support of Trump, compared with none for Clinton, according to a Reuters analysis of contributions over $200 made by several of the biggest coal companies and their employees.
Coal faces a potentially starker future under Clinton. She has promised to build on Democratic President Barack Obama's disputed Clean Power Plan to curb carbon output and suffered political damage earlier this year when she said that by doing so ""we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."" 
Those jobs are already quickly evaporating. 
The industry now employs only about 65,000 miners across states like West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Wyoming, down from around 91,000 in 2011, according to the most recent statistics from the U.S. Department of Energy. The country's top two biggest coal companies, Arch and Peabody Energy, this year filed for bankruptcy.
Neither Trump scrapping federal regulations nor the expanded use of CCS will likely restore the sector, where production last year dropped to the lowest level since 1986, to its previous heights. Coal  faces a dual headwind of both a global push for cleaner energy such as wind and solar power, and drilling technology that has made its competitor natural gas abundant - and cheap.
Jeff Holmstead, a Republican lobbyist at Bracewell Law, said if Clinton wins, much of coal's fate in coming years could be determined in the first 30 to 60 days. By then it should be known whether she appoints staunch environmentalists at departments including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior.
But he is confident that Clinton would work with industry on CCS and allow ""coal to play a role in the future in the U.S. power sector."" 

Elizabeth Gore, a Democrat who lobbies with Brownstein, Hyatt, Farber and Schreck for a coal-burning cooperative said coal companies must ""find the marginal changes they can make to buy themselves some time, to provide more of a soft landing.""

U.S. crude futures for December delivery were down 0.11% at $44.61 a barrel, just off a fresh five-week low of $44.30 a barrel hit overnight.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the December Brent contract slipped 0.28% to trade at $46.20 a barrel, close to the five-week trough of $45.97 a barrel hit earlier in the session.
Crude prices were hit after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that crude oil inventories rose by 14.4 million barrels last week, much more than the expected crude-stock gain of 1.0 million barrels.
The commodity also remained under pressure amid growing skepticism over the implementation of a planned deal by OPEC to limit production.
OPEC reached an agreement to cap output to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held in Algeria in late September. However, the 14-member oil group said it won’t finalize details on individual output quotas until its next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.
The possibility that producers could walk away empty-handed from the November meeting looms large after Iraq, Iran, Nigeria and Libya all signaled they might not take part in the proposed production cut deal. Russia’s unclear stance is also fueling uncertainty.

164,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2016 03:58AM ET</span>",Oil set for sixth straight day of declines,"By Henning Gloystein
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices were on course for their sixth straight day of falls on Friday, dragged lower by a surge in U.S. crude inventories, timid demand and doubts over the ability of producers to coordinate output cuts.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $46.21 per barrel at 0740 GMT (3:40 a.m. ET) , down 14 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were down 9 cents at $44.57 a barrel.
The dips put crude on the longest losing run since June and, before that, since January, with Brent shedding almost 14 percent since its recent peak in mid-October.
""The persistent market dynamic of softer demand and stronger supply will become a more dominant driver of prices as the impact of OPEC's verbal interventions begins to fade and expectations for coordinated cuts are readjusted,"" BMI Research said.
""We see a trading range of $43-53 per barrel leading oil markets into the new year and we maintain our forecasts of an average 55 per barrel and $53.5 per barrel for Brent and WTI respectively for 2017,"" it added.
Analysts said markets were also weighed down by traders pulling out money from futures ahead of the U.S. presidential elections, which are seen as a risk to markets.
""I suspect the main drivers are that risk is being taken off the table ahead of next week's election,"" said Jeffrey Halley of OANDA brokerage in Singapore.
Beyond concerns ahead of the elections, traders said oil fundamentals were also weak, with U.S. crude stocks surging, demand growth low, and doubts that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producer Russia can agree on a meaningful output cut this month.
While oil production remains near records and inventories are high, British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said demand growth was timid.
Demand growth over July-September was less than a third that of the year-ago quarter, Barclays said in a note, estimating last quarter's growth below 1 million barrels per day (bpd). 
The consumption rise for the last quarter will not be much higher, before averaging 1.3 million bpd in 2017, it added. 
In the United States, crude oil stockpiles soared more than 14 million barrels last week, the largest build on record, highlighting that a global fuel supply overhang is far from over.
""The sharp increase in U.S. crude imports (+2 million bpd week-on-week), led to a strong inventory build (first one since late August), with crude inventories now back to the top of the 5-year range,"" Jefferies bank said.

Also in the United States, the Colonial Pipeline carrying gasoline, which was disrupted this week by an explosion, is expected to restart Line 1 on Sunday afternoon.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The global accord to combat climate change agreed in Paris last year officially entered into force Friday, putting pressure on nearly 200 countries to start executing plans to slash their greenhouse gas emissions. 
""This is a moment to celebrate,"" said United Nations climate chief Patricia Espinosa. ""It is also a moment to look ahead with sober assessment and renewed will over the task ahead.""
The Paris Agreement seeks to wean the world economy off fossil fuels in the second half of the century, limiting the rise in average world temperatures to ""well below"" 2.0 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above preindustrial times.
It takes effect as greenhouse gas emissions are projected by 2030 to exceed by 12 billion to 14 billion tonnes what is needed to keep global warming to the internationally agreed target, the United Nations said this week.
Representatives from nearly 200 countries on Monday will convene in Marrakesh, Morocco for two weeks to discuss the nuts and bolts of the Paris accord and the policies, technology and finance needed to ensure the Paris goals are achieved.
""The timetable is pressing because globally greenhouse gas emissions which drive climate change and its impacts are not yet falling – a fact which the Marrakesh meeting must have at the front of its concerns and collective resolve,"" said Espinosa.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 54 billion cubic feet in the week ended October 28, just below market expectations for an increase of 56 billion cubic feet.

HUNTINGTON, WV (Reuters) - When Carissa Sellards talks to her West Virginia University friends about post-graduation plans, one dilemma keeps coming up – whether to stay in their home state or strike out for more promising opportunities elsewhere.
If recent history holds, over half of them will either not find work or leave the state, contributing to a brain drain of young talent that is pushing the state to try to reinvent its economy and break with a coal industry in long-term decline.
""Companies don’t come here to invest because they only associate us with coal,"" said Sellards, a 20-year-old sophomore who addressed the state legislature when she was in high school about the lack of opportunities for young people in a post-coal economy.
The often stark choices faced by Sellards and other young, educated West Virginians underline the challenges awaiting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton here and in other “Rust Belt” states if she wins the Nov. 8 election, as most polls suggest she will.
West Virginia is expected to vote decisively for Republican Donald Trump, who has gained in recent polls and promises to revive the coal industry and put miners back to work by easing environmental restrictions and renegotiating trade deals to America’s advantage. It is a message that has resonated with millions of older voters in other Rust Belt states facing declines in manufacturing jobs and feeling threatened by foreign competition. 
But it largely rings hollow for college-educated millennials like Sellards, who are seeking jobs in the service economy or technology sector.
By contrast, Clinton alienated swathes of West Virginia voters by saying earlier this year that “we’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business” in transitioning to cleaner energy. Coal industry backers have long accused President Barack Obama of waging a “war on coal” by imposing tougher environmental standards.
Clinton later apologized for her comment, and has proposed a $30 billion plan to help revitalize coal communities. The plan promises to secure health benefits for former coal workers, invest in new infrastructure such as broadband access, and repurpose old mines and power plant sites.
Clinton energy adviser Trevor Houser has said her challenge will be to help coal and other Rust Belt communities deal with economic realities rather than ""false promises"" of restoring dying industries.
Beneath the nostalgic coal rhetoric, West Virginia officials and grassroots groups have quietly started to focus on reversing the flight of college-educated millennials to help drive an economic revival.
Of the 124,358 students who graduated from public higher education in West Virginia in the last decade, 58,730 were working in the state in 2014, a work participation rate of 47.2 percent, according to a report released by West Virginia University's Bureau of Business and Economic Research on Monday.
The state had the 11th biggest net outflow of college degree holders from 2007-2014, according to the most recent U.S. census.
One barrier to keeping graduates in state is a business start-up rate that is the lowest in the country at 5.1 percent in 2014, the most recent year of available data.
A Reuters analysis of national data shows a strong connection between migration patterns of college graduates and local start-up rates: Among the 25 states with start-up rates below the 2014 median of 6.8 percent, 19 saw a net outflow of college grads between 2007 and 2014.
The debate over West Virginia’s economic future comes as its coal production this year hit its lowest level since the 1970s.
West Virginia's energy sector, which includes coal, natural gas production and utilities, account for 17 percent of the state's GDP but only 4 percent of employment. Coal industry employment plunged 53 percent between the fourth quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2016, down from nearly 26,000 to just over 12,000.
The government is the state's biggest employer, accounting for 20 percent of jobs, with healthcare a fast-growing sector at 17 percent. In 2014, West Virginia's real GDP grew 0.7 percent from the previous year compared to the national average of 2.2 percent.
The state is one of a few whose population shrank over the past two years, according to the latest national census. By median age it is the second-oldest U.S. state, four years above the national average.
At the West Virginia University Institute of Technology’s new campus in Beckley, which opened in August, close to some of the state’s coal counties, officials hope to turn the struggling city into an innovation hub.
In addition to offering courses in burgeoning fields like computer science, sustainable tourism and health care, WVU Tech hosts the Launch Lab, a small business incubator that helps budding entrepreneurs bring ideas to fruition.
Joe Carlucci, a small business coach and director of the LaunchLab, said West Virginia is at the start of a long process of reinvention after decades of mourning coal.
“They are prepared to plant that seed and not see the shade of that tree,"" he said. ""They are seeing that we have to change our own story.""
 
FEDERAL SUPPORT
Although Clinton would struggle to regain popularity in Rust Belt states if elected, these regions would have an incentive to work with her administration to tap into federal grants.
West Virginia Republican Congressman Evan Jenkins, a member of the House appropriations committee who represents the state’s southern coal-producing regions, said the state cannot turn down assistance to diversify its economy.
""I want to continue fueling grant-making opportunities to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit and energy of the state’s millennials,” he told Reuters at a ceremony in August in which federal grants were awarded.
But unleashing that spirit will require a significant investment in infrastructure, specifically broadband access, something that local lawmakers ignored when coal was still performing well eight years ago, said Chris Walters, a 30-year old Republican state senator. 
Walters is focused on getting legislation passed to expand broadband access throughout the mountainous state, which ranks near the bottom of the list of broadband connectivity, just ahead of Guam and Puerto Rico.
“If we don’t give connectivity to our residents, we aren’t giving them the opportunity to succeed in the global economy,” said Walters.
In state capital Charleston, NGO Generation West Virginia has helped pass legislation to attract young entrepreneurs seeking low-cost alternatives to places like Denver or San Francisco, including a bill to waive business start-up fees to people under 30 and another to allow crowd-funding to help seed new businesses.
Entrepreneurship also extends to industries like agriculture, which state officials see as an opportunity in the state’s rural coal counties.
An entrepreneurship program called the Coalfield Development Corporation won a $2 million grant this year to help train young people from coal counties to run businesses, offering them college classes, life skills and paid apprenticeships.
Ben Gilmer, the 34-year-old director of the corporation's agriculture entrepreneurship program Refresh Appalachia, said part of Clinton's challenge in coal country will be to sell the vision of a future that is unfamiliar.
Small programs like his can offer concrete examples and help ease the transition, he said.
""Politicians take advantage of people’s fear of what comes next,"" Gilmer said. ""But five years from now, we will have examples and that will speak louder than any rhetoric that's out there.""

182,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2016 05:31PM ET</span>",Militants attack oil pipeline in Niger Delta,"By Tife Owolabi and Alexis Akwagyiram
YENAGOA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Militants in Nigeria's southern Niger Delta oil hub attacked a pipeline operated by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the state oil company said on Wednesday, a day after regional leaders put a series of demands to the president.
Community leaders from the Niger Delta, which is the source of most of the OPEC member's oil, met President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday and asked him to pull the army out of the oil hub, order oil firms to move headquarters there and spend more on development to end militancy in the region.
It was the first time that Buhari had met leaders from the since militants started a wave of attacks on oil pipelines in January to push for the impoverished region to receive a greater share of oil revenues.
The military said on Wednesday that troops taking part in a routine patrol in Delta State heard an explosive sound, believed to have been caused by attackers, at Batan Flow Station around Ekweregbene. Sheriff Mulade, a witness, said the attack happened at around 1200 GMT.
NNPC spokesman Garba Deen Muhammad later confirmed that the attack took place. ""Production is affected but I cannot tell you by what magnitude,"" he said.
The flow station is located in a creek between the southern city of Warri and the Forcados oil terminal, which last week resumed crude exports following repairs after an attack.
Although attacks had cut oil production by around a third in recent months, the oil minister said on Tuesday production was back up to 2.1 million barrels a day.
The production rise follows a ceasefire observed by many militant groups in the region over the last few months.
Niger Delta Avengers, the most active group in the region, said in August it would halt hostilities. Since then it has carried out two attacks - one in September and another last week.
Nigeria has held months of talks to end the violence but no lasting ceasefire has been agreed in the oil hub, where many complain about poverty, even though the region provides much of Nigeria's oil exports.
Any ceasefire would be difficult to enforce as the militants are splintered into small groups of angry, young unemployed men whom even their leaders struggle to control.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said the U.S. government is examining ways to reroute an oil pipeline in North Dakota as it addresses concerns raised by Native American tribes protesting against its construction.
Obama's comments late on Tuesday to online news site Now This were his first to directly address the escalating clashes between local authorities and protesters over Energy Transfer Partners' $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline project. 
""My view is that there is a way for us to accommodate sacred lands of Native Americans. And I think that right now the Army Corps is examining whether there are ways to reroute this pipeline,"" Obama said in the video interview.
On Wednesday, protesters on the banks of the Cantapeta Creek confronted law enforcement, as they attempted to build a wooden pedestrian bridge across the creek to gain access to the Cannon Ball Ranch, private land owned by ETP, according to a statement from Morton County officials. 
The U.S. Justice and Interior Departments along with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers halted construction on part of the pipeline in September due to protests by Native American tribes who contend the pipeline would disturb sacred land and pollute waterways supplying nearby homes. The affected area includes land under Lake Oahe, a large and culturally important reservoir on the Missouri River where the line was supposed to cross.
Construction is continuing on sections of the pipeline away from the Missouri River, one of the owners of the pipeline and a U.S. refiner Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) said. 
The 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline, being built by a group of companies led by Energy Transfer Partners, would offer the fastest and most direct route to bring Bakken shale oil from North Dakota to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.
North Dakota officials are girding for a long fight. The state's emergency commission on Tuesday approved another $4 million loan to support law enforcement during the protests. 
David Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, in a Wednesday statement lauded Obama's comments and called on the administration and the Army Corp of Engineers to issue a stop-work order on the pipeline on federal land. He also called for a full environmental impact study.
""The nation and the world are watching,"" he said. ""The injustices done to Native people in North Dakota and throughout the country must be addressed. We believe President Obama and his Administration will do the right thing.""
LETTING THE SITUATION PLAY OUT
Obama said government agencies will let the situation ""play out for several more weeks and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that I think is properly attentive to the traditions of First Americans."" 
Morton County Commission Chairman Cody Schulz, in response to Obama’s statement regarding the pipeline, said that letting the situation play out ""affords the opportunity to the out-of-state militant faction of this protest to keep escalating their violent activities."" 
The Now This video, however, suggests that Obama was talking about the review process, not the protests. The president later in the interview says that he wants to make sure that both protesters and law enforcement are ""refraining from situations that might result in people being hurt."" 
The fight against the pipeline has drawn international attention and growing celebrity support amid confrontations between riot police and protesters. More than 140 people were arrested when a protest was broken up by law enforcement nearly a week ago.
Some have said an alternative pipeline route could be a way to get over the impasse.
In North Dakota, gubernatorial candidate Marvin Nelson, a Democratic state representative, said in an interview with Reuters last week that moving the route 10 miles north could make a difference.
""It would take some time to do that, but it seems to me to be a much safer route and it wouldn't need to cross culturally sensitive land,"" he said. 
Environmental group 350.org urged Obama to reject the federal permit for the entire project.
""There's no reroute that doesn't involve the same risks to water and climate,"" said Sara Shor, a campaign manager for 350.org. 

""President Obama breaking the silence on Dakota Access is a testament to the powerful resistance of Indigenous leaders, but he shouldn't sit back while people are facing violent repression from militarized law enforcement on the ground.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Attorneys for Brazil's state-controlled oil company, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, asked a U.S. federal appeals court on Wednesday to decertify a class of investors trying to recoup billions of dollars in losses stemming from a sprawling corruption scandal.
Petrobras, as the company is known, and its bank underwriters argued that it is not clear buyers and sellers of the company's securities, traded on exchanges all around the world, were doing transactions in the Unites States. Only securities traded in the United States can be included in the class action.
The attorneys also argued before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that the plaintiffs had failed to adequately show the news of the bribery and political kickback scandal in Brazil had a downward effect on the company's stock price.
Petrobras wants to reverse a decision made in February by lower-court Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan that certified two classes of plaintiffs, saying their claims are similar enough to be pursued as groups.
Class certification can make it easier for investors to recoup larger sums than if they sued individually, though it does not guarantee they will be recover.
Prosecutors in Brazil have accused former Petrobras executives of accepting more than $2 billion of bribes over a decade, mainly to from construction and engineering companies. Petrobras has said that it was a victim of the scheme by corrupt individuals. 
The scandal has contributed to a plunge in Petrobras' market value to below $20 billion from nearly $300 billion fewer than eight years ago, according to Reuters data, and investors in the company want a payout.
Jeremy Lieberman, an attorney at Pomerantz representing the shareholders, argued that Rakoff's decision was correct and the district court would easily be able to ""call balls and strikes"" to determine who should be included and left out of the class. 
He also said there was a clear link between bad news about developments in the Petrobras investigation in Brazil and a drop in share price. 
One class approved by Rakoff bought various Petrobras securities from January 2010 to July 2015 and will be led by Universities Superannuation Scheme of Liverpool, England. The other bought debt securities from offerings in 2013 and 2014, and is led by North Carolina's treasurer and the Employees' Retirement System of Hawaii.

190,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2016 07:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Oil majors join forces in climate push with renewable energy fund,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Top oil companies including Saudi Aramco and Shell (LON:RDSa) are joining forces to create an investment fund to develop technologies to promote renewable energy, as they seek an active role in the fight against global warming, sources said. 
The chief executives of seven oil and gas companies --  BP  (LON:BP), Eni, Repsol (MC:REP), Saudi Aramco, Royal Dutch Shell,  Statoil  (OL:STL) and Total -- will announce details of the fund and other steps to reduce greenhouse gases in London on Friday.
The sector faces mounting pressure to take an active role in the fight against global warming, and Friday's event will coincide with the formal entry into force of the 2015 Paris Agreement to phase out man-made greenhouse gases in the second half of the century.
The group is part of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), which was created with the backing of the United Nations in 2014 and includes 11 companies representing 20 percent of global oil and gas production. 
The company leaders are expected to detail plans to create an investment vehicle that will focus on developing technologies to lower emissions and increase car engine and fuel efficiency, according to the sources involved in the talks who declined to be named.
The size and structure of the fund were unclear.
The fund will also focus on ways to reduce costs of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which involves capturing carbon dioxide emissions produced from fossil fuel burning plants and re-injecting them into underground caverns.
OGCI, Shell, Total and BP declined to comment.
The CEOs are also expected to announce the next phase of their plan to reduce the oil sector's emissions, primarily by reducing flaring of excess gas at fields, increasing the use of CCS and limiting the release of methane, a highly polluting gas often emitted through pipe leaks.
OGCI leaders called on governments last year to set a price on carbon emissions to encourage the use of cleaner technologies, although some companies including  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) have resisted the idea.
They now hope to show they can play an active role.
The drive to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century poses a threat to oil and gas companies as transport and power sectors gradually shift towards renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind.
Oil majors including Norway's Statoil, France's Total and Italy's Eni, have increased their investments in renewable energy in recent years, although it is still dwarfed by the main fossil fuel business.
Oil producers have also lobbied for the phasing out of coal in favor of the less pollutant natural gas in the power sector.
Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said last month that OGCI leaders will announce plans ""to work collectively to develop technologies which will be needed to face climate change issues.""
Delegates from signatory nations meet in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh on Nov. 7-18 to start turning their many promises into action and draw up a ""rule book"" for the sometimes fuzzily worded Paris Agreement on climate change, reached last December.

LONDON (Reuters) - Crude oil prices fell for a fourth day on Wednesday as jittery investors awaited official U.S. stockpile figures later in the day after industry data showed a surprise build in inventories, underlining the market's supply overhang.
The American Petroleum Institute said that crude stockpiles rose by 9.3 million barrels in the week to Oct. 28, more than nine times the amount expected by analysts polled by Reuters. [API/S]
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) fell by 70 cents to $45.97 by 0611 ET and Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 69 cents at $47.45. Both contracts were at their lowest since Sept. 28.
Official inventory data from the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration will be released later today. [EIA/S]
Rising production from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) also weighed on prices.
""We have increasing production from Libya and Nigeria helping to create more surplus. Also, all OPEC members are producing as much as they can to have a high base line to negotiate from at the OPEC meeting,"" said SEB chief commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop.
Nigerian Oil Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu said on Tuesday that oil output had recovered to 2.1 million barrels per day.
The West African country's Trans Niger Pipeline, one of two conduits to export Bonny Light crude, reopened on Oct. 28 after a month-long shutdown, a Shell (L:RDSa) spokeswoman said late on Tuesday.
Libya has doubled its output since mid-September and is currently producing about 590,000 bpd, state-run National Oil Corp said. 
OPEC production is likely to set another record high in October at 33.82 million bpd from a revised 33.69 million bpd in September, according to a Reuters survey on Monday.
Prices have slumped in recent days as hopes have faded that oil producers would settle their differences and agree to output cuts when OPEC meets on Nov. 30.
""Those who were hoping for some upside from any sort of production agreement appear to have had their hopes dashed,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. ""It looks like there are speculative longs quitting the market."" 
Meanwhile, Saudi Aramco, the state-owned producer from Saudi Arabia, expects prices to rise in the first half of 2017 as the market returns to balance, Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said late on Tuesday.

Nasser also said that preparations for the oil giant's initial public offering are going well and it is still aims to list in 2018.

Natural gas for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by as much as 5% to a session low of $2.867 per million British thermal units.
It was last at $2.892 by 10:40AM ET (14:40GMT), down 13.4 cents, or 4.4%. A day earlier, they lost 7.9 cents, or 2.54%.
Updated weather forecasting models showed that high pressure weather systems will dominate over the central and southern U.S. this week, resulting in much warmer than normal conditions.
Overall, demand for natural gas will be much lighter than normal with the lack of subfreezing temperatures across the eastern U.S. and the Great Lakes-region.
Meanwhile, market participants awaited weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 49 and 59 billion cubic feet in the week ended October 28.
That compares with a gain of 73 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 56 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 63 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.909 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 1.3% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 4.7% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas futures have been under heavy selling pressure in recent days as warmer-than-average weather in key gas-consuming regions in the U.S. ignited speculation that a mild winter will curtail demand for the heating fuel and leave a glut of it in storage, weighing on prices next year.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather reduces demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.

202,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2016 05:38AM ET</span>","Explosion, fire in Alabama on gasoline pipeline kills one","HELENA, Ala. (Reuters) - Colonial Pipeline Co shut down its main gasoline and distillates pipelines on Monday after an explosion and fire in Shelby, Alabama, killing a worker and sending five to the hospital - the second time in two months it had to close the crucial supply line to the U.S. East Coast.
A nine-man crew was conducting work on the Colonial pipeline system at the time of the explosion, Alabama Governor Robert Bentley told a briefing. Seven of the crew members were injured, with two evacuated by air.
The explosion occurred when a contract crew hit the gasoline pipeline (Line 1) with a trackhoe, igniting gasoline, Colonial said an e-mailed statement late on Monday.
One worker died at the scene and five individuals were taken to Birmingham-area hospitals for treatment, the company said.
Four were taken to the UAB hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, hospital spokesman Adam Pope said.
A segment of pipeline was undergoing maintenance on Monday afternoon when it exploded. The fire had been contained as of around 9 p.m. (0100 GMT on Tuesday), according to local media reports.
Crews built a 8-foot (2-meter) tall dirt dam to contain burning fuel, Bentley said on Twitter late on Monday.
The explosion sparked wildfires, burning 32 acres, the governor said.
Colonial said company personnel and emergency crews were responding to the incident. The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, said it had personnel on the way to the site.
Bentley's office said on Twitter the site was about a mile west of a massive leak last month that closed the gasoline pipeline for over 12 days. A 3-mile (4.8-km) area around the site had been evacuated, the governor said.
A temporary flight restriction is in effect in the area around the pipeline explosion, the Alabama Emergency Management Agency said on Twitter.
Colonial, the biggest refined products system in the United States, is responsible for supplying about one-third of the 3.2 million barrels per day of gasoline consumed on the East Coast, according to U.S. Energy Department data.
Colonial was working to restart a section of pipeline damaged after its biggest leak of gasoline in nearly two decades on Sept. 9, which released as much as 8,000 barrels (336,000 gallons) of gasoline in Shelby County. The restart was planned for mid-November after removal of a bypass line installed after the September leak.
The pipeline closure drove up gasoline prices at the pump in the U.S. Southeast and on futures markets.
On Monday, U.S. gasoline futures jumped as much as 13 percent to $1.6351 a gallon, their highest since early June, following news of the explosion. Futures pared gains thereafter, falling by about 6 cents, or 3.7 percent.
The 5,500-mile (8,850-km) Colonial Pipeline is the largest U.S. refined products pipeline system and transports gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the New York Harbor area. The pipelines that shut run from Houston to Greensboro, North Carolina.
It has already had five spills reported in Alabama in 2016, including the one in September, according to PHMSA data.
Pipeline safety has come under increased scrutiny in recent months following a dispute over Energy Transfer Partners' 1,100-mile (1,770-km) North Dakota Access Pipeline.
The U.S. government halted construction on a segment of that pipeline in early September following protests from Native Americans who said the pipeline could desecrate sacred grounds and that spills could contaminate drinking water.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices rose from one-month lows in Asian trading on Tuesday after OPEC agreed on a long-term strategy that was seen as an indication the cartel was reaching a consensus on managing production.
But further gains are likely to be limited as the market was weighed down by further indications of record output from the group, a sign the glut that has kept a lid on prices is not draining away as fast as the oil bulls would like.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were up 23 cents at $47.09 a barrel at 0725 GMT. They plunged nearly 4 percent to $46.86 a barrel in the previous session.
Brent for January delivery, the new front-month contract, was up 45 cents at $49.06 a barrel. The previous front-month contract fell nearly 3 percent before expiry on Monday.
""After such a dramatic price drop ... this could be a bit of a technical correction. I'm still bearish on oil in the sense that the OPEC deal won't be realized,"" said Jonathan Chan, oil analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.
Oil prices had risen as much as 13 percent since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced on Sept. 27 a production cut to support prices after the slump that began in mid-2014. The cartel said members' cuts will be finalised at a meeting later this month.
Still, OPEC approved a document on Monday outlining its long-term strategy that would mean returning to its role of managing the market and being more proactive in anticipating market changes.
That was a more bullish signal after OPEC representatives met on Friday in Vienna, and then again on Saturday with their counterparts from non-member producers, but failed to reach any specific terms, and sources said Iran has been reluctant to even freeze output.
""The lack of progress on implementing production quotas and the growing discord between OPEC producers suggests a declining probability of reaching a deal on November 30,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a research note.
Kazakhstan has no plans to reduce oil output despite attending the meetings of OPEC and non-OPEC producers, Kazakh Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev said on Tuesday.
Bozumbayev told reporters the giant Kashagan field, where global majors are about to begin commercial output, would be the main driver of output growth and limiting Kashagan's production would not be possible.

OPEC's oil output likely hit a record high in October, rising to 33.82 million barrels per day as Nigeria and Libya partially resumed output after disruptions and Iraq raised overseas sales, according to a Reuters survey.

210,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2016 03:08PM ET</span>",OPEC officials approve group's delayed long-term strategy: sources,"By Alex Lawler and Rania El Gamal
LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC officials approved on Monday a document outlining the exporter group's long-term strategy, in a sign its members are making progress in ironing out differences over how and when to manage production levels and, ultimately, oil prices.
The approval of the document has been repeatedly postponed with OPEC price hawks such as Algeria and Iran saying the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries should be prepared to defend oil prices by cutting production.
But OPEC's de facto leader Saudi Arabia has been arguing since the end of 2014 that oil prices should be determined by the market and OPEC should not cut output to make room for higher-cost producers.
However, since the last time the long-term strategy was debated and rejected by OPEC officials in May, the kingdom's position has shifted and OPEC in September agreed to limit its supplies to boost prices - its first such decision since 2008.
With veteran Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi replaced by Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia has signalled its willingness to return to managing the market and reducing production levels arguing that otherwise global investments could drop too steeply and cause a new super-spike in oil prices.
On Monday, four OPEC sources said the OPEC board of governors, which has been discussing an update of the long-term strategy since 2015, met in Vienna and approved the latest version.
""It's approved,"" one of the sources said, adding the meeting ""went smoothly."" 
""Yes, finally,"" another source said, adding that only few changes had been made and that unlike in previous meetings when Saudi Arabia clashed with Iran, on Monday Riyadh managed to convince other countries without much of a struggle.
The board of governors discussed how member countries would view the role of the exporting group in coming years, OPEC sources said. OPEC should not return to individual quotas and it should be more than a talking shop, the sources said, deflecting criticism of its refusal to intervene in the market two years ago when prices started falling sharply. 
They agreed that it should return to its role of managing the market - which it has effectively abandoned since 2014 - and become more proactive in anticipating changes in demand and supply patterns, the sources said. 
Executing real production cuts still remains a challenge for OPEC - on Friday its officials failed to reach a compromise after hours of talks amid objections by Iran.

But other OPEC officials including Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo remain optimistic a final deal on supply cuts will be agreed when oil ministers meet next on Nov. 30.

211,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2016 01:40PM ET</span>",Argentina negotiates oil worker contracts in effort to woo investment,"By Juliana Castilla
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's government is negotiating more flexible oil workers' contracts to woo investors to the Vaca Muerta shale fields and overcome an energy deficit, the head of one of the sector's most powerful unions told Reuters on Monday.
High labor costs are thought to be the primary obstacle to investment in the country's oil and gas sector, and negotiations are politically sensitive in a country with an influential labor movement, meaning some changes are off the table.
""Negotiations are advanced, I'd say 80 percent, but the union will not budge on job security for workers,"" Guillermo Pereyra, General Secretary of the private oil and gas union in Rio Negro, Neuquen and La Pampa, and Senator for the province of Neuquen, said in an interview.
Argentine Production Minister Francisco Cabrera told reporters in Washington last week that state-controlled energy company YPF (BA:YPFD) and unions were holding labor talks ""because it is impossible to be productive.""
An agreement would allow companies to stop paying workers for commuting time, or so-called taxi hours, and would allow some workers to be hired only for short-term projects.
Vaca Muerta in southern Argentina, one of the world's largest shale reserves at some 30,000 square kilometers, has attracted investment from  Chevron  (N:CVX) and Exxon (N:XOM), but remains largely unexplored. 
Argentina's unions became more demanding in the days of $100-per-barrel oil, and have been resistant to change, making companies like  BP  (L:BP) say they need to see more flexibility in labor laws before committing investments.
It is not clear if the labor agreement will be enough to interest new companies.
""We got to the point where we had so many strikes and conflicts that we could not even work,"" the director of one company operating in Patagonia said on condition of anonymity.
New technology should allow drilling with a team of 16 workers, but the unions require companies to continue to employ 25 workers, the director said as an example.
On top of drilling costs, companies have to make a 10 percent contribution for ""social peace,"" a subsidy for out-of-work oil workers. Some companies report up to 60 percent of their employees are frequently absent.
Daniel Gonzalez, financial director of YPF, said recently the company's production was affected by two strikes this year.

""We continue projecting stable output for the year, but it could be negatively affected by more labor conflicts,"" he said.

212,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2016 12:29PM ET</span>",GE to merge oil unit with Baker Hughes to create service giant,"By Swetha Gopinath and Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) said on Monday it would merge its oil and gas business with  Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI), creating the world's second-largest oilfield services provider as industry competition heats up to supply more-efficient products and services to the energy industry.
The deal to create a company with $32 billion in annual revenue will combine GE's strengths in making equipment long-prized by oil producers with Baker Hughes's expertise in drilling and fracking new wells.
GE is already the world's largest oilfield equipment maker, supplying blowout preventers, pumps and compressors used in exploration and production. GE also has invested heavily in large data processing services just as the oil industry eyes its potential to boost oil recovery.
Baker Hughes, by contrast, is seen as one of the world leaders in horizontal drilling, chemicals used to frack and other services key to oil production. 
""Both of them are quite complimentary in terms of their skills set,"" GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said on CNBC on Monday. ""Our oil gas customers are going to want more productivity solutions.""
Still, shares of Baker Hughes were down nearly 3 percent, a drop that Immelt and Baker CEO Martin Craighead said likely was due to the deal's complicated structure. 
The new company will vault Baker Hughes's market share ahead of rival  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL), which tried and failed to buy Baker until the deal collapsed last May, and also compete heavily with Schlumberger NV (N:SLB), the world's largest oilfield service provider, for customers. 
GE will own 62.5 percent of the new publicly traded company. The deal is expected to close in mid 2017.
Analysts said there was little overlap between the businesses of GE and Baker Hughes that would worry regulators.
GE and Baker Hughes will reach out to the Justice Department and European antitrust enforcers on Monday, according to a source close to the company. They have not yet determined how many jurisdictions they will need to file in.
GE will argue to antitrust enforcers - who stopped the deal between Halliburton and Baker Hughes just months ago - that their deal is complementary, and that they are committed to any remedy needed to win deal approval, the source said. 
A small part of GE's business is selling equipment to Baker Hughes' competitors and they will continue those sales, the source said.
One expert knowledgeable about the oil business said General Electric and Baker Hughes had largely different businesses. 
""I don't see any overlaps, significant overlaps,"" said Tom Seng, a veteran of the energy business who teaches at the University of Tulsa. 
OIL PRICES NEAR $50
The deal comes at a time when North American oil and gas producers are putting rigs back to work after a near-freeze in activity caused by a slump in oil prices that began mid-2014.
But the deal is predicated on a forecast for oil prices to rise to $60 per barrel by 2019, GE's Immelt told investors on Monday morning.
""This is a very compelling time for the deal,"" Immelt said, noting he expects $1.6 billion in annual cost savings by 2020.
Global oil prices (LCOc1) have risen by a third this year to trade near $50 a barrel.
Activist investor Nelson Peltz, whose Trian Fund Management owns about 0.8 percent of GE as of June 30, told CNBC the new company would be able to go ""nose-to-nose"" with Schlumberger.
Oilfield service providers including Schlumberger, which bought oilfield equipment maker Cameron in April, are trying to broaden their offerings to meet demand from customers for better but cheaper ways to more oil out of the ground.
GE said last week it believed the oil market had bottomed, but that demand for the equipment it makes would take longer to recover, probably until after the first half of next year.
The company has been refocusing on its industrial roots after its financial business, GE Capital, ran into problems during the 2008 financial crisis.
MOLECULE TO MEGAWATT
The combined company should help GE attract more users to its internet-based operating system, Predix, which is designed to optimize production.
Shareholders of Baker Hughes, which had a market value of about $26 billion as of Friday, will get a special one-time cash dividend from GE of $17.50 per share - or a total of $7.4 billion - after the deal closes. 
The new company, to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will have dual headquarters in Houston and London. It was not immediately clear if the new company will retain the name ""Baker Hughes.""
Baker Hughes shares rose as much as 5 percent in morning trade before reversing course to trade down 3.3 percent at $57.14. Shares of GE rose 0.5 percent to $29.35.

Centerview Partners and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are advising GE, while Shearman & Sterling is its legal adviser. Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) is Baker Hughes's financial adviser, with Davis Polk acting as legal adviser.

Natural gas for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 3.4 cents, or 1.1%, to $3.071 per million British thermal units by 10:45AM ET (14:45GMT).
Updated weather forecasting models showed that high pressure weather systems will dominate over the central and southern U.S. this week, resulting in much warmer than normal conditions.
Overall, demand for natural gas will be much lighter than normal with the lack of subfreezing temperatures across the eastern U.S. and the Great Lakes-region.
Meanwhile, market participants awaited weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 49 and 59 billion cubic feet in the week ended October 28.
That compares with a gain of 73 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 56 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 63 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.909 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 1.3% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 4.7% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas futures have been under heavy selling pressure in recent days as warmer-than-average weather in key gas-consuming regions in the U.S. ignited speculation that a mild winter will curtail demand for the heating fuel and leave a glut of it in storage, weighing on prices next year.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather reduces demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A global grain forum hosted by Russia next month, the first of its kind in seven years, looks set to be snubbed by Western agriculture ministers as tensions rise over the Syria crisis.
Three weeks before the World Grain Forum, to be hosted by the Agriculture Ministry in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on November 18-19, its public program looks dominated by local officials and analysts.
The timing could not be worse. Western power are threatening new sanctions against Moscow - already punished for its role in the Ukraine crisis - over Russian air strikes in Syria.
Russia's agriculture Minister Alexander Tkachev might have been hoping for a rare chance to see his EU counterparts at the forum as he is banned from entering the bloc.
Few, if any, of them look likely to attend.
German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt, for example, will visit Russia in November but will not attend the forum, a spokesman for the German Ministry said. Germany will be represented by specialist experts. 
""Because of the tight appointment calendar of a minister it is naturally the case that not every invitation can be accepted and not every conference can be visited personally,"" the spokesman for the ministry said.
The first World Grain Forum was held in Russia in 2009 on the initiative of then President Dmitry Medvedev, now Russia's Prime Minister, after he tabled the idea at a summit of leaders from the Group of Eight (G8), which has since become the G7 after Moscow was excluded.
Speakers at that event included government ministers or officials from Germany, Brazil, Japan, China and Ukraine as well as a leading official from the EU's executive body, the European Commission.
The provisional list of speakers this time includes professors from universities in the United States and Britain.
""It is a pure matter of policy and sanctions. Most major countries will be represented at the forum, but by experts (rather than government ministers and top officials). Business is also coming,"" said an industry source.
Organizers say they expect to see official delegations from over 50 countries and the agriculture ministry told Reuters it hopes more countries would confirm their participation in the coming weeks.

It did not provide the list of delegates but said that business and official representatives of more than 25 countries had already confirmed they would attend.

(Reuters) - Reservations over the ability of the world's largest oil producers to reach a binding agreement to limit output has prompted analysts to leave their price outlook broadly unchanged, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.
The 35 analysts and economists polled by Reuters forecast Brent crude futures will average $44.78 a barrel in 2016 and $57.08 in 2017, compared to the $44.74 a barrel and $57.28 outlook for the same periods in the previous month's survey.
Brent (LCOc1) has averaged $43.93 per barrel so far this year.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which had agreed to reduce output to a range of 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day in Algiers last month, is expected to work out the details on individual cuts in its formal meeting in November. 
However, with Iraq joining Iran, Libya and Nigeria in seeking an exemption from cutting output, analysts are skeptical the various OPEC members can reach a consensus.    
""New puzzle pieces are being revealed at every turn, puncturing the well-crafted impression of a unified OPEC cartel,"" OCBC Bank analyst Barnabas Gan said in a note.    
Iraq has asked to be excused from OPEC crude output restrictions saying it needs the income to combat Islamic State. Iran, Libya and Nigeria, whose output has been hit by sanctions or conflict, too have sought exemption from the cuts.
""The exclusion of key nations as well as the negative sentiment on the deal from the Iraqis both reinforce the idea that a true shift in the physical market is not likely,"" said Jeffrey Quigley, Director, Energy Markets, at Stratas Advisors.
While there is a strong possibility of top producer Russia agreeing to freeze output at current peak levels, other non-OPEC producers were unlikely to join the effort and may even end up increasing production, analysts said.   
Should the deal fail to materialize, analysts anticipate a sharp sell-off that could drag prices towards $40 a barrel, and for the existing supply glut to last until at least mid-2017.
""Currently, our main concerns are the very high level of speculative positions (net long non-commercial positions) and a stronger U.S. dollar, as these could fuel a sell-off in the event of deteriorating fundamentals or disappointments from the OPEC meeting,"" said Intesa SanPaolo analyst Daniela Corsini.
A possible interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve, a softening Chinese economy and easing of geo-political concerns in countries such as Libya and Nigeria may further dampen a recovery in oil prices, the poll showed.  

The poll forecast U.S. light crude (CLc1) will average $43.46 a barrel in 2016 and $55.22 in 2017. WTI has averaged $42.31 so far in 2016.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices slid on Monday after non-OPEC producers made no specific commitment to join OPEC in limiting oil output levels to prop up prices, suggesting they want the oil producing group to solve its differences first. 
Officials and experts from OPEC countries and non-OPEC nations including Azerbaijan, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Oman and Russia met for consultations in Vienna on Saturday and only agreed to meet again in November before a scheduled regular OPEC meeting on Nov. 30, they said in a statement.
London Brent crude for December delivery (LCOc1) was down 38 cents at $49.33 a barrel by 1047 GMT after settling down 76 cents on Friday.
U.S. WTI crude for December delivery (CLc1) was trading down 30 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $48.40 a barrel, after closing down $1.02 on Friday.
""Oil prices are starting the new week of trading down after a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC countries failed to produce any agreement at the weekend,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note. 
It added there could be more downward pressure later in the day as it expected OPEC production surveys to show the cartel produced ""significantly more oil than necessary in October."" 
On Friday, OPEC members failed to agree how to put in place a global deal to limit production, following objections from Iran which has been reluctant to even freeze its output, sources said. 
OPEC and non-OPEC countries said in a joint statement that their Saturday meeting was a ""positive development"" towards reaching a global output limiting deal on Nov. 30. 
Robin Bieber, director with PVM Oil Associates, said the OPEC deal was ""a shambles."" 
""If OPEC were in any doubt what awaits failure to agree a production cut in November last week's price action should have been a wake-up call,"" Bieber said. 
Asian imports of Iranian crude oil jumped by 70 percent in September on the year, a sign of its growing market share, while Russia expects to increase its oil output by 0.7 percent next year and a further 0.9 percent in 2018, the draft federal budget showed.
Russia also expects crude production to hit a record-high 548 million tonnes in 2017, up from an estimated 544 million tonnes this year.

In another bearish sign, money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions for the first time in five weeks in the week ended Oct. 25, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.

Baker Hughes' planned merger with bigger rival  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) fell through in May due to opposition from regulators.
A partnership with Baker Hughes could help GE to transform its oil and gas division and emerge a larger player in the sector to better compete with oilfield services leader Schlumberger (N:SLB).

Also, this partnership could give Baker Hughes a chance to redefine itself following the failed merger.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Non-OPEC producers made no specific commitment on Saturday to join the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in limiting oil output levels to prop up prices - a stance that suggested they wanted OPEC to solve its differences first.
Officials and experts from OPEC countries and non-OPEC nations including Azerbaijan, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Oman and Russia met for consultations in Vienna on Saturday and only agreed to meet again in November before a scheduled regular OPEC meeting on Nov. 30, they said in a statement.
A day earlier, OPEC members themselves were unable to agreed on how to implement a global deal to limit output after hours of talks amid objections by Iran which has been reluctant to even freeze its output levels, sources said.
""We have to agree on the real numbers,"" non-OPEC Kazakhstan's vice-minister of energy, Magsum Mirzagaliev, told reporters after seven hours of talks on Saturday.
""It is important that we meet once again with detailed numbers. We agreed that we have to meet in 3-4 weeks with numbers, because every country has his own opinion,"" he said.
OPEC and non-OPEC said in a joint statement the meeting on Saturday was a ""positive development"" towards reaching a global output limiting deal on Nov. 30.
Oil (LCOc1) is trading closer to $50 a barrel, less than half its price of mid-2014, weighed down by persistent oversupply and squeezing the incomes of exporting nations.
Last month, OPEC agreed at a meeting in Algeria very modest production cuts, its first since 2008, in an effort to help prop up prices. But the cuts have yet to be finalised.
The meeting of OPEC experts, known as OPEC's High Committee, does not decide policy but will make recommendations to the next OPEC ministerial meeting on Nov. 30.
The meeting on Friday exposed old faultlines among OPEC members, especially the organization's de facto leader Saudi Arabia and its arch-rival Iran.
Tehran argues it wants to regain its oil market share it had lost during years of sanctions, which were eased earlier this year as part of a nuclear deal with the West. 
Riyadh, which is fighting several proxy wars with Iran, including in Syria and Yemen, is reluctant to make concessions to Tehran.
WAITING FOR OPEC
OPEC members have not agreed between themselves on a single set of production figures from which to make the agreed cutbacks, and members including Iraq, Iran, Libya and Nigeria - whose output has been held back by sanctions or conflict - have asked ‎for special treatment in curbing output.
The last time OPEC persuaded non-OPEC nations to make joint cuts was as long ago as the start of the millennium.
Azerbaijan's energy minister Natig Aliyev told reporters before the start of the meeting he believed the global deal was still possible.
""Just one week ago we met with the president of Venezuela,"" he said, in reference to the south American OPEC member which has been pushing for measures to support prices. 
""Venezuela and Azerbaijan agree that some measures will be taken to stabilize the market. We agreed the price of oil can be around $60 per barrel.""
Brazil's representative said his country was attending only as an observer. ""Brazilian production will increase in the next few years,"" said Brazilian official Marcio Felix.
Russia, one of the world's top producers, which has been supporting joint actions with OPEC, also attended the meeting in Vienna but made no public comment.
Two OPEC sources said Russian energy officials told the gathering that Moscow was still willing to freeze its output levels if OPEC agreed to cap its production.

""Russia is ready but they want to see in detail figures agreed for yesterday,"" one of the sources said. Another source said Russia would freeze if OPEC agreed to reduce output.

CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - Native American leaders vowed on Saturday to protest through the winter against a North Dakota oil pipeline they say threatens water resources and sacred lands, and are weighing lawsuits over police treatment of arrested protesters.
A group of at least 200 Native American demonstrators meanwhile returned to the scene of an earlier confrontation with police to stage a peaceful ceremonial prayer vigil near the town of Cannon Ball, at the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.
A smaller crowd of 25 to 50 rallied on the grounds of the state capitol in Bismarck, about 30 miles to the north, in a separate protest of the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline, police said. No arrests were reported at either location. 
At a news conference in Mandan, just outside Bismarck, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II said he and other tribal leaders were devising ways to furnish food, heat and shelter for protests to continue through the cold-weather months.
""We're just working through some technical details as far as where the land is, and the type of land that can be used for some permanent structures,"" Archambault told reporters.
At least 10 shelters were being readied on tribal land against temperatures that can plunge to less than 35 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (-37 Celsius) for days at time, he said.
""Let's reroute the pipeline. It doesn't have to put our water at risk,"" said Archambault, who was flanked by Cheyenne River Sioux Chairman Harold Frazier.
The planned 1,172-mile (1,885-km) path of the pipeline, the project of a group of companies led by Energy Transfer Partners LP, would skirt the Standing Rock reservation by about a half mile. But the Standing Rock tribe and environmental activists say it threatens water supplies as well as sacred Native American sites. 
Supporters say the pipeline, construction of which was halted by the federal government in September, offers the fastest and most direct route for bringing Bakken shale oil from North Dakota to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.
More than 400 protesters have been arrested in protests against the pipeline since Aug. 10 that have attracted support from such actors and celebrities as Mark Ruffalo, Shailene Woodley, Susan Sarandon and Chris Hemsworth.
Archambault said his tribe may pursue a class-action over police tactics on Thursday. 
Officers in riot gear swept through a protester camp on private land using pepper spray, bean bag rounds and an audio cannon against demonstrators who refused to leave. At least 142 people were arrested on Thursday and Friday.
The Morton County Sheriff's Department has said some protesters set fire to roadblocks and threw rocks, bottles and homemade gasoline bombs at officers. 
In an apparent easing of tensions on Saturday, sheriff's deputies allowed activists under escort to retrieve personal belongings left behind at the protest site in Thursday's raids.
Separately, a group of 200 to 300 protesters led by Chief Arvol Looking Horse, spiritual leader of the Sioux nation, marched from a nearby campground to a police barricade, where they held a quiet prayer ritual and ceremonial dancing.

The chief crossed the barricade to shake hands with a number of police officers, and the group quietly left after about three hours.

Musk is the biggest shareholder in both Tesla and SolarCity, which is run by two of his first cousins. Analysts have been dubious of the deal's proposed synergies, with some suggesting the merger is a way for Tesla to rescue money-losing SolarCity. A vote on the acquisition is scheduled for Nov. 17.
The rollout of the product, expected as soon as next summer, would be ""unwieldy"" if the two companies are not combined, Musk told reporters.
Having two separate companies ""slows things down, makes them more expensive. It's worse for shareholders,"" he said.
Musk refused to answer a reporter's question about how Tesla's balance sheet would accommodate the acquisition of SolarCity.
By incorporating solar modules into rooftops, Tesla is hoping to succeed with a solar technology that to date has had little success. Just this year,  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) said it would stop selling a solar shingle it launched five years ago.
Tesla's glass solar roof tiles would look far better than any similar product, Musk said. They can be manufactured in a range of styles, which were demonstrated on the rooftops on the set.
Tesla gave little detail on cost, except to say that the cost of the roof would be less than a conventional roof plus solar. The product will appeal to home builders and people looking to replace their roofs, Musk said, adding that the shingles would be more durable and have better insulation qualities than conventional roofs.
SolarCity co-founder Peter Rive, Musk's cousin, said the solar roofs could easily have a five percent share of the new roof market within a year or two.

The new generation of home and industrial batteries will be available this year.

233,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2016 04:40PM ET</span>",Baker Hughes-GE talks come after difficult time for both companies,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Industrial giant  General Electric  Co and oilfield services company  Baker Hughes , both beset by difficulties during oil's two-year price rout, may have a clear path out of the doldrums: join forces.
GE (N:GE) said Thursday it was in discussions with Baker Hughes Inc (N:BHI) but not to acquire the company outright. Baker Hughes said Friday talks were ongoing. Both companies declined to comment on the talks beyond official statements. 
GE's oil and gas division has fought to get the scale the conglomerate enjoys in other industries. Despite efforts to grow through a series of acquisitions, the division has faced weaker revenues during oil's downturn than other units of GE. Organic growth in oil and gas has lagged other sectors. 
Baker Hughes had its own growth difficulties, spending a year and a half stuck in limbo amid a $28-billion merger with Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) that was ultimately scrapped after opposition from antitrust regulators. 
Following the termination of the Halliburton merger, Baker Hughes CEO Martin Craighead has said the company is well positioned to focus on developing products that lower costs and maximize production for operators in the oil and gas industry. 
Baker Hughes shares gained 8.4 percent Friday to $59.12, valuing the company at about $25 billion. 
With oil prices rebounding to $50 a barrel, M&A activity could tick up as investors see the two-year rout in crude ending. A partnership with Baker Hughes could allow GE's oil and gas division to transform itself into a larger player in the sector to better compete with oilfield services leader Schlumberger Inc (N:SLB), and could give Baker Hughes a chance to redefine itself following the failed merger. 
“If there’s a time to double down on the sector, now is the time given the prices we’ve seen,” said Jonathan Garrett, principal analyst for U.S. upstream research at Wood Mackenzie. The partnership would be formed at a time GE has been shrinking its capital markets division and is returning to its industrial roots, he said.
For GE, which strives to be in the top of each industrial sector, oil and gas has been a harder area to develop, said Ed Hirs, energy fellow at the University of Houston. Baker Hughes offers good capitalization and scale for the smaller GE unit.
""This is a pretty good, intelligent bet on the future,"" he said, noting that it comes as the oil market's downturn appears to be ending. The downturn led oilfield service companies to cut their prices, curtailing profits. 
Baker Hughes is ""a much-emasculated industrial enterprise relative to its pre-HAL dalliance days,"" Bill Hebert, senior research analyst at Piper, Jaffray & Co, said in a note to clients. 
Both companies have faced pressure from activist investors. ValueAct Capital is the largest shareholder of Baker Hughes, investing after the merger with Halliburton was announced and betting upon its success. After the collapse of that merger, ValueAct has remained Baker Hughes’ top shareholder. 
Trian Partners is one of GE's largest shareholders, and has demanded that the company cut costs and be more disciplined about acquisitions.
The exact structure of a deal could determine the benefits for both sides. GE could gain breadth from Baker Hughes' strengths in downwell services, completion and artificial lift, while Baker Hughes could improve its services with technologies developed by other GE units, analysts said.
GE has forecast cost cuts at the division and has said it will ""try to compensate"" for the fact that the division has earned less than expectations given a year and a half ago. The company had purchased Lufkin, a pump maker, for $3.3 billion just one year before oil prices cratered. 

""We still think it's a really good GE business,"" GE CEO Jeff Immelt said on the company's most recent earnings call. ""I have every confidence we're going to come out of the cycle better than we went in.""

VIENNA/DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC officials meeting in Vienna to work out the details of their plan to reduce oil production failed to reach agreement after hours of talks on Friday, amid objections by Iran which has been reluctant to even freeze its output, OPEC sources said.
The High Level Committee of experts will meet again in Vienna on Nov. 25 ahead of the next meeting of OPEC ministers on Nov. 30, to ""finalise individual quotas"", one source said.
They will also meet as scheduled on Saturday with representatives of non-OPEC producers, which OPEC wants help from in curbing supplies.
""Yes, we continue tomorrow with non-OPEC,"" one of the sources said. ""(There was) no complete agreement today since Iran refuses to freeze production.""
""We didn't finish all. We are looking to the next meeting on November 25 to finalise individual quotas,"" another source said.
The meeting of the High Level Committee is comprised mainly of OPEC governors and national representatives - officials who report to their respective ministers.
Talks lasted just over 11 hours on Friday with Iran appearing to be the main sticking point.
""There is no agreement yet, all agree except Iran,"" one OPEC source said, adding Iran was asking for an exemption.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had agreed last month in Algiers to reduce their production of crude oil to a range of 32.50 million to 33 million barrels per day, OPEC's first output cut since 2008, in an effort to prop up prices.
But from the outset the proposed plan faced potential setbacks with Iraq wanting to be exempt from cuts and countries including Iran, Libya and Nigeria whose output has been hit by sanctions or conflict also wanting to raise their output.
""It is getting complicated,"" a delegate said before the meeting began on Friday.
""Every day there is a new issue coming up.""
However, other OPEC officials including Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo remained optimistic.
""Our deliberations today, and tomorrow with some non-OPEC producers, could very well have fundamental ramifications for the market, as well as for the medium to long term of the industry,"" Barkindo said in a speech on the opening day of the two-day meeting, according to a text provided by OPEC.
The committee does not decide policy and will instead make recommendations to the next OPEC ministerial meeting on Nov. 30.
Iraq, OPEC's second-biggest producer, said earlier this week that it would not cut output and should be exempted from any curbs as it needs funds to fight Islamic State.
Meanwhile Iran has insisted on its right to recover market share after Western sanctions were lifted in January.

Non-OPEC nations sending representatives to Saturday's talks are Russia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Oman, Azerbaijan, Brazil and Bolivia.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Friday and were set for the biggest weekly losses in six weeks over doubts about whether OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will be able to agree on an output cut big enough to curb a global glut that has weighed on markets for two years.
Experts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and counterparts from other oil-producing nations such as Russia started two-day negotiations on Friday over an output-capping agreement expected to be presented at the end of next month.
Disagreements remain over which members should be exempt from a curb to reduce output to a range of 32.5-33 million barrels per day (bpd).
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were down 16 cents at $50.31 a barrel at 0823 GMT (4:23 a.m. ET). The contract was set to close the week more than 2 percent lower in its steepest weekly loss since mid-September.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (CLc1) crude was down 27 cents at $49.45 a barrel, also on track for its biggest weekly loss in six weeks.
""Doubts linger about OPEC's ability or willingness to implement any production cuts,"" said analysts at Cenkos Natural Resources.
""The market has been wary of reading too much into the rhetoric ahead of the next meeting scheduled for the end of November.""
French oil major Total said on Friday it expected crude prices to remain volatile and continued to reduce costs.
The French company said it loses around 2 billion euros in cashflow for every $10 downward move in oil prices.

Weak prices have also hit Italian oil firm  ENI  (MI:ENI), which reported a worse-than-expected quarterly loss on Friday.

241,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 28, 2016 04:51AM ET</span>",Oil futures slip ahead of OPEC meeting to discuss supply cut prospects,"Investing.com - Oil prices were lower during European hours on Friday, as investors looked ahead to a technical meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to discuss the details of an eventual agreement on oil production freezes and/or cuts by member countries.
Crude oil for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped 21 cents, or 0.42%, to $49.51 a barrel by 4:48AM ET (08:48GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for December delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London fell 13 cents, or 0.26%, to $50.34 a barrel.
Oil futures have been under pressure in recent days amid market skepticism over the implementation of a planned deal by OPEC to limit production.
The 14-member oil group reached an agreement to cap output to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held on the sidelines of an energy conference in Algeria late last month.
However, OPEC said it won’t finalize details on individual output quotas until its next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.
In September, the group’s production reached 33.4 million barrels a day.
Friday’s meeting of cartel members was meant to set the building blocks for implementation to be undertaken at the November meeting.
The possibility that producers could walk away empty-handed from the upcoming meeting looms large after Iraq, Iran, Nigeria and Libya all signaled they might not take part in the proposed production cut deal.
OPEC members will be joined by other oil producers on Saturday to discuss possible coordination.
Russia has said that it was in favor of the OPEC’s deal and suggested that it could agree to a freeze, but uncertainty over its exact position on its own output continued to put pressure on crude.
Market participants will also gauge U.S. production on Friday with the Baker Hughes’ rig count data set to cap the week.

Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped $1.35, or 0.11%, to $1,268.15 a troy ounce by 3:51AM ET (07:51GMT).
The U.S. is set to release preliminary data on third quarter GDP at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT) Friday. Consensus expects the reading to show a significant strengthening from the second quarter’s 1.4% growth to a 2.5% expansion.
Fed officials have indicated that interest rates could rise in December if the economy remains on track.
The near-term outlook for gold remains cloudy as a recent string of positive U.S. economic data combined with hawkish remarks from key Fed officials heightened expectations for an interest rate hike before the end of the year.
The U.S. central bank's next meeting is in November, but a rate hike ahead of the presidential election is seen as unlikely.
Instead, traders are currently pricing in around a 78% chance of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
A day earlier, the yellow metal gained $3.10, or 0.25%, after data showed that orders for U.S. manufactured capital goods unexpectedly fell in September.
Total durable goods orders, which include transportation items, dropped 0.1% last month, the Commerce Department said, compared to economists' expectations for a gain of 0.1%.
Core durable goods orders, which exclude volatile transportation items, rose 0.2% last month, in line with forecasts.
Durable goods excluding defense and aircrafts slumped 1.2% in September, compared to expectations for a 0.3% gain.
A separate report released at the same time on Thursday showed that the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week fell less than expected, but remained in territory associated with a healthy labor market.
The number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits decreased by 3,000 last week to 258,000, the Department of Labor said. Analysts expected jobless claims to fall by 6,000 to 255,000 from the previous week’s total of 261,000.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was last at 98.74 early Friday, within sight of a nine-month high of 99.09 touched earlier this week.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for December delivery shed 1.6 cents, or 0.09%, to $17.623 a troy ounce during morning hours in London, while copper futures gained 0.3 cents, or 0.16%, to $2.163 a pound."

OPEC members were scheduled to meet on Friday with invited non-OPEC producers expected to join the group on Saturday to continue discussion.
OPEC sent an invitation to 12 non-cartel states including Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Oman, Egypt, Bahrain, Colombia, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, Bolivia, Norway and Canada.
Russia, Kazakhstan and Mexico were reported to have confirmed attendance while Norway decided not to participate.
The two-day gathering was the result of a decision made by OPEC on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum held on September 28 in Algeria to set a production ceiling of 32.5-33 million barrels per day.
The September agreement was reached against the backdrop of decline in oil prices, which had fallen from around $110 a barrel to values below $50 since mid-2014.
The technical committee meeting in Vienna on Friday was expected to identify the production volume of individual OPEC member countries, while discussing participation with non-cartel states on Saturday.
Analysts have been skeptical not only about the possibility of an agreement being hammered out, but that individual countries would adhere to any imposed quotas.
One third of OPEC members will not participate
Iraq, the second biggest producer in OPEC after Saudi Arabia, insisted last weekend that it should be exempt from any deal to scale back production as it needs the oil revenue to fund its continuing war against Islamic State militants.
Iraq argued that its case was similar to Nigeria and Libya, two more countries that were exempted from the Algiers deal because violence has wrought havoc in their oil industries.
Some news reports said Iraq is only willing to freeze output at its September level. However, the country reports that it produced 4.78 million barrels a day last month, while OPEC estimates from secondary sources put the total at 4.46 million. It is assumed that production caps would be based on the OPEC forecasts.
Falah Al-Amri, the head of the state-backed Iraqi company State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO), was quoted as saying that his country had topped 4.7 million barrels per day and would not backtrack.
Adding to the fact that Iran also stated that it would not reduce production until it reached pre-sanction output of 4 million barrels per day, the implication is that no less than one third of total OPEC production will not be participating in any plan.
OPEC optimistic over hammering out agreement
Still, there were hopes that oil producers would be able to sign off on a deal as Saudi Arabia and its Gulf OPEC allies said they were already willing to cut 4% from their peak oil output, energy ministers from the Gulf countries told their Russian counterpart this week, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
The report suggested that given the unwillingness of the aforementioned countries to make reductions to their output Saudi Arabia would have to decide if it was willing to make a further concession in order to close the deal.
Additionally, after Venezuelan oil minister Eulogio del Pino and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak met last Tuesday to discuss OPEC’s progress on a freeze, the Russian Energy Ministry issued a statement:
""The sides discussed the issue of participation of the OPEC states and independent oil-producing countries in the agreement on oil output freeze, various versions of which are being elaborated at the moment.""
The statement came after RIA Novosti Monday cited a “cartel source” as saying that ""the agreement is about 90% ready.""
The source also indicated that there are no ""principal disagreements"" among the members of the cartel on the issue.
In any case, OPEC secretary general Mohammed Barkindo also showed himself to be optimistic over an eventual deal.
On October 18, Barkindo stated that he expected ""all building blocks of agreement to be in place"" by the official OPEC meeting set for November 30 at which details on individual output quotas are expected to be finalized.
As market participants awaited developments in Vienna on Friday, oil traded lower. U.S. crude futures lost 0.32% to $49.56 by 3:08AM ET (7:08GMT), while Brent oil traded down 0.28% to $50.33."

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Unpaid debts and broken promises are making Venezuelan oil giant PDVSA an outcast in several Caribbean countries where it had been a guest of honor.
The state-run company's crumbling finances are causing operational disruptions across one of its most essential regions, according to internal company documents, six sources with knowledge of its operations, and Thomson Reuters vessel-tracking data.
Business partners in the island nations of Curacao, Bonaire, Jamaica and the Bahamas are turning away from the firm as debts pile up to tugboat operators, ship brokers, maritime agencies and terminal owners, the sources and documents show.
The company's problems include blocked loading operations in the Bahamas and threats from the governments of Curacao and Jamaica to replace PDVSA as a partner of refineries in both places. Many vessels are also anchored offshore, blocked from discharging cargoes at ports because PDVSA has not paid suppliers and business partners.
The mounting Caribbean problems are adding to a broader crisis for PDVSA, which is already reeling from declining production, low crude prices and an unprecedented economic downturn at home. The company saw operating cash flow plummet by 63 percent, to $2.1 billion, in the first quarter compared to the same period a year earlier, according to its most recent financial report.
PDVSA's Caribbean operations represent a quarter of its global refining capacity and serve as a loading hub for a third of its exports of crude and fuel oil.
For a graphic on PDVSA's facilities in the Caribbean, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2dEYaRb
""PDVSA has absolutely lost ground in the Caribbean,"" said Lisa Viscidi, director of Energy, Climate Change and Extractive Industries at the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, noting falling oil sales in the region for the past two years.
PDVSA did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
In the latest mishap, a PDVSA fuel-oil cargo bound for Asia has been trapped in the Caribbean sea for more than a month after a court ordered the detention of the tanker ""Hero"" in Curacao, according to sources with direct knowledge of the situation and Thomson Reuters vessel-tracking data.
Curacao's port authority barred the ship from leaving on Sept. 18 after a unit of Core Laboratories won the court order to force payment of delinquent debts, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. PDVSA had allegedly failed to pay the unit, Saybolt, several million dollars for months of oil testing services.
Mark Elvig, general counsel for Core Laboratories, declined to comment.
REVERSAL OF FORTUNE
The problems reflect a stark reversal for a company that has been a trusted partner of governments in the Caribbean.
About a decade ago, Caribbean countries laid out red carpets for PDVSA executives, who came offering cheap oil under the Petrocaribe program that leftist President Hugo Chavez launched to win allies as a bulwark against Washington.
Petrocaribe worked well for years, as poor islands curbed the impacts of rising global oil prices and Venezuela bartered oil for everything from medical services to black beans.
PDVSA had used Caribbean facilities to offset frequent outages and incidents plaguing its storage, refining and port networks in Venezuela. The region offers vast storage capacity, ample refineries and crude blending facilities, and deep water docks to load Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) for trips to Asia.
But the relationships of the past are now increasingly strained as suppliers and service providers go unpaid.
""PDVSA's cash flow problems are impacting routine operations,"" a trader at a private company that has worked with PDVSA in the Caribbean told Reuters on condition of anonymity. ""You only accumulate several million dollars in debt for port services by not paying for months or even years.""
The company has slashed its operating budget to $45 million monthly from $145 million monthly in 2015, the PDVSA trading team source said. That budget pays for all trade activities in Venezuela and overseas, the source said, including tanker cleaning, routine inspections, storage, brokerage, freight costs, port services and oil imports.
REFINERIES AT RISK
The tanker detention came days after Curacao's government signed a memorandum of understanding with Guangdong Zhenrong Energy, indicating the Chinese firm could soon replace PDVSA as the operator of the Isla refinery in 2019.
Officials in Curacao have said the move follows years of frustrated efforts to persuade PDVSA to invest $1.5 billion to upgrade Isla.
""We have decided not to wait any more and look for alternatives,"" said Ben Whiteman, the island's Prime Minister, in a broadcasted speech in September.
The island's government declined a Reuters request for comment, and the Chinese firm did not respond.
PDVSA said in a September news release that the renewal of its lease is not up for negotiation yet.
Isla is strategically important because its lease contract includes the Bullenbay terminal, with 17.75 million barrels of storage and blending capacity. Bullenbay is where PDVSA receives the imported light oil it mixes with its own extra heavy crude to create an exportable blend.
Also in September, Winston Watson, general manager of Petrojam - Jamaica's state company that owns the Kingston refinery - said he was fed up with PDVSA's foot-dragging on upgrading the plant.
""If they say no, then I guess we would have to go to the market and seek another investor,"" he said of PDVSA to lawmakers in parliament, according to a transcript.
Petrojam and the Jamaican government did not respond to requests for comment. 
LATE RENT, STRANDED SHIPS
Another setback came in the Bahamas. For about a month starting in mid-September, PDVSA was blocked from loading cargoes at the massive BORCO terminal because of late rent payments for storage tanks, according to one of the PDVSA sources and a ship broker.
The BORCO standoff contributed to an ongoing decline in PDVSA's exports - and its ability to generate cash - just as payment delays snarled its imports.
In September, PDVSA's crude exports suffered an annual decline of 12 percent to 1.55 million barrels per day, according to Thomson Reuters Trade Flows data.
U.S.-based Buckeye Partners, which operates the terminal, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Near other Caribbean and Venezuelan ports, about a dozen tankers carrying around 2.5 million barrels of light crude and products - including two cargoes supplied by  BP  (LON:BP) - have been stuck at sea for weeks at a time, waiting for payment from PDVSA before discharging, according to traders from private firms and vessel tracking data.
In May, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made an official visit to Jamaica and sought to reassure Caribbean dignitaries of PDVSA's long-term health.

""Be confident,"" he said. ""Venezuela has faced situations even more difficult than the one we are passing through.""

(Reuters) - Sixteen Native Americans and other protesters were arrested in North Dakota on Thursday in the latest clash between police and demonstrators seeking to halt construction of a disputed oil pipeline.
The arrests came as police moved to clear a camp on private property in the path of the proposed $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline, according to the Morton County Sheriff's Department.
Native American protesters had occupied the site since Monday, saying they were the land's rightful owners under an 1851 treaty with the U.S. government.
Video posted on social media showed dozens of armed police and two armored vehicles slowly approaching one group of protesters during the confrontation.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the video, which showed a helicopter clattering overhead as some protesters said police had used bean bag guns in an effort to chase them out of the camp.
The sheriff's department said in a statement that pepper spray was used on some of the estimated 330 protesters.
""This is not about the pipeline. This is not about those who wish to legally protest. This is about the rule of law,” Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said in a statement. 
North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple said police were successful in clearing the camp. 
""Private property is not the place to carry out a peaceful protest,"" he said. 
The 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline, being built by a group of companies led by Energy Transfer Partners LP, would offer the fastest and most direct route to bring Bakken shale oil from North Dakota to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. 
Supporters say it would be safer and more cost-effective than transporting the oil by road or rail. 
But the pipeline has drawn the ire of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and environmental activists who say it threatens the water supply and sacred tribal sites. They have been protesting for several months, and dozens have been arrested.
Members of the Standing Rock Sioux asked Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday to oppose the pipeline. She has so far not taken a public position on the issue.
In September, the U.S. government halted construction on part of the line. The affected area includes land under Lake Oahe, a large and culturally important reservoir located on the Missouri River in southern North Dakota where the line was supposed to cross.
Opposition to pipeline construction has increased in recent years, and environmental activists protested against the Keystone XL line that was rejected by the Obama administration.

251,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2016 01:10PM ET</span>",Recovering Anglo American sticks to asset sales but with less haste,"By Barbara Lewis and Tiisetso Motsoeneng
LONDON/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Shares in  Anglo American  (L:AAL) are up more than 200 percent this year, like prices of the coking coal it mines, and yet the group is sticking to an overhaul accelerated when commodity markets were rock bottom and it was in deep trouble.
Now that Anglo American is the best performing blue chip on the London Stock Exchange and some minerals have rebounded, shareholders want the firm to achieve top prices as it sells swathes of its bulk commodities business under a strategy of concentrating on high value minerals.
The global miner hatched the strategy three years ago. However, it needed to speed up the asset sales and job cuts last year, when its shares dived 75 percent as investors worried about the group's ability to cope with a heavy debt burden during the commodity slump.
Since last December's announcement that Anglo American would offload three-fifths of its assets and focus on diamonds, platinum and copper, the rally in bulk commodity prices has transformed the market mood.
Bulk commodities such as coal and iron ore are generating cash for Anglo American, and shareholders are demanding that these assets are disposed of at high prices - or not at all.
Chief Executive Mark Cutifani rules out a fire sale and says Anglo American will reduce its portfolio of businesses at its own pace, agreeing deals when the price is right.
""We said at the outset in 2013 that we needed to focus the portfolio. So, the asset strategy hasn't changed, but we needed to accelerate at the end of 2015,"" Cutifani told Reuters this week. ""That is what we are doing and we are progressing pretty well to that plan.""
Questioning of the divestment policy intensified after the appointment in September of a new chief financial officer with a track-record at iron ore giant Fortescue (AX:FMG) - even though iron ore is one of the assets Anglo American says is no longer central to its portfolio.
Robust production results this week reinforced the view that the firm has less need to sell assets that are generating cash.
The group's top shareholder, South Africa's state-owned Public Investment Corp, is critical. ""The PIC is not in favor of Anglo American's asset sale plan in its current format. Talks are ongoing to see what's best of all for shareholders,"" a source familiar with the fund's thinking told Reuters.
PIC fears that much of Anglo American's South African assets will be sold piecemeal to foreign buyers. ""The PIC would like to see a break-up where Anglo creates an Africa-focused local company, owned and run by South Africans, and keeps its overseas operations,"" the source said.
A PIC spokesman had no immediate comment.
WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES
A year ago, Anglo American's debt reached $12.9 billion, and slumping commodity prices had wiped out its profits. In December it suspended dividend payments until the end of 2016.
Now the firm says it is on track to reduce the figure to less than $10 billion by the end of the year. Low interest rates can also allow it to cut servicing costs by rolling over debt. 
Anglo American is also making progress on another measure of balance sheet strength in the capital-intensive mining sector - the ratio of its net debt to its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
This is around 2.4 times, it says, in line with its target of a ratio sustainably below 2.5.
Further asset sales could improve the firm's credit-worthiness. The Moody's agency moved Anglo American's rating up a notch in September, although it remains two notches below investment grade. Further upgrades could follow ""greater visibility"" on disposals of iron ore and coal, Moody's said. 
""We expect the company's net leverage to decline to around 2x net debt/EBITDA at the end of this year,"" Elena Nadtotchi, a vice president at Moody's, said. 
""A sustained increase in net leverage to above 2x net debt/EBITDA could lead to a downgrade, while a further decline in net leverage would be credit positive.""
Many analysts also say Anglo American's disposal strategy makes sense longer term, but the urgency has disappeared.
""The risk of selling assets at the bottom of the commodity price cycle - and thereby crystallizing losses - has to a significant extent dissipated,"" analysts Bernstein said in a note this month.
IMMINENT?
The most imminent sale is meant to be of Anglo American's Australian coal assets to a group headed by private equity firm Apollo (N:APO), sources close to the deal say. 
This has been held up by price negotiations and analysts expect any agreement to include an escalator clause under which Anglo American would get more if the coal market keeps rising.
Richard Knights, analyst at Liberum, said a price of say $1.5 billion would equate to about 9 months' cash flow at current coal prices. ""I would be surprised if they did a deal without some sort of price escalator,"" he said.
Together with Anglo American's other big sale this year of its niobium and phosphates business to China Molybdenum for $1.5 billion, the coal deal would take it to at least the lower end of its 2016 target of selling assets worth $3-$4 billion.
CASH GENERATION OR DISPOSAL
While placing the focus on a high-value core, Anglo American always said bulk operations, such as iron ore and coal, would be managed, for ""cash generation or disposal over time"".
For now, they are generating cash. Coking coal has sold for well over $240 a ton, up 210 percent this year. Australian thermal coal spot prices have hit $100 per ton for the first time since 2012, a nearly 100 percent rise since June.
Anglo American estimates a $10 per ton price increase in coking coal creates a $142 million rise in pre-tax earnings, while for thermal coal it leads to an extra $54 million to $200 million, depending on the region.
Iron ore's gains are smaller at around 30 percent, but margins are high. <.IO62-CNI=SI> A $10 per ton rise adds $491 million to pre-tax earnings, Anglo American calculates.
Prices of Anglo American's core commodities have by comparison barely moved, but their time will come, analysts predict.
They are expected to rise late in the commodity cycle when other raw materials fall as China, for instance, switches from smelting new metal, which uses high volumes of coking coal and iron ore, to recycling scrap.

Copper and platinum are also regarded as plays on a more environmentally sustainable future. Copper, as the best conductor of electricity, could benefit from grid upgrades to carry power from renewable sources, while platinum is used in catalytic converters to make cars less polluting.

Natural gas for delivery in December on the New York Mercantile Exchange rallied 4.5 cents, or 1.48%, to $3.081 per million British thermal units by 10:55AM ET (14:55GMT). Futures were at around $3.053 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 73 billion cubic feet in the week ended October 21, matching market expectations.
That compared with a gain of 77 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 62 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 76 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.909 trillion cubic feet, just 1.3% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 4.7% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas futures have been under heavy selling pressure in recent days as warmer-than-average weather in key gas-consuming regions in the U.S. ignited speculation that a mild winter will curtail demand for the heating fuel and leave a glut of it in storage, weighing on prices next year.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather reduces demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.

253,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2016 10:10AM ET</span>","As cracks emerge in global oil pact, Saudis may need to compromise","By Rania El Gamal
DUBAI (Reuters) - Tough negotiations await a group of OPEC experts as they meet their counterparts from other oil producers such as Russia on Oct. 28-29 to hammer out details of an output-capping agreement, with disagreements threatening to scupper the deal.
OPEC agreed in Algeria last month on a modest oil-production cut in the first such pact since 2008, with the group's top producer Saudi Arabia softening its stance on arch-rival Iran amid mounting pressure from low oil prices. 
But cracks have surfaced in the Algiers agreement, which would reduce output to a range of 32.5-33 million barrels per day (bpd), and Saudi Arabia may have to offer a major concession if it wants to cement the accord.
Saudi Arabia and its Gulf OPEC allies are already willing to cut 4 percent from their peak oil output, energy ministers from the Gulf countries told their Russian counterpart this week, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Iraq, OPEC's No. 2 producer, said this week that it would not cut output and should be exempted from any curbs as it needs funds to fight Islamic State. Baghdad's stance is likely to face opposition from Riyadh and its Gulf allies, OPEC sources said. 
""I expect it to be a very tough meeting,"" one OPEC source said of the expert talks in Vienna.
""If there is a cut, then everyone must cut. No exemptions,"" the source said, commenting on Iraq's demands.
There is a general understanding that only Libya, Nigeria and Iran should be exempt as their output had been hit by wars and sanctions, three OPEC sources said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries estimates its output at 33.39 million bpd, meaning it needs to cut about 400,000 to 900,000 bpd to meet its target.
OPEC has yet to agree at which level Iran would freeze production, with Tehran having emerged from years of sanctions and aiming to regain market share. 
Iran has said it is producing 3.85 million bpd, close to its pre-sanctions output of 4 million bpd.
A source familiar with Iranian thinking said Tehran was unlikely to match its pre-sanctions output this year. 
""We are not going to harm the market by drastically increasing production ... We have done much of the work, there is 200,000 to go and that will take a year,"" the source said.
SAUDIS ""DESPERATE"" FOR A DEAL
An attempt to bring non-OPEC Russia, the world's top oil producer, into a cut deal was rebuffed by Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak in Riyadh on Sunday during a closed-door meeting with Gulf energy ministers, the sources said.
""The Russian minister told the ... ministers that Russia will not cut production. He said they have been talking about a freeze, not a cut,"" said a source who was briefed on the talks. 
Another source confirmed that the message from Moscow was that Russia is not ready to cut and can only freeze output at current levels of 11.11 million bpd, a record high.
That would require a bigger Saudi concession and deeper cuts by the kingdom to stabilize an oversupplied market and prop up prices that stand well below the budget needs of most producers.
Most analysts say Saudi production will fall in winter anyway as the summer heat eases, reducing the need for cooling. State oil giant Saudi Aramco also plans to shut two refineries towards the end of this year for maintenance, which could mean reducing crude output by as much as 700,000 bpd.
The 4 percent cut offer by the Gulf OPEC bloc is likely to be made at this week's meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC experts in Vienna, the sources said.
Riyadh's highest output was reached in July at 10.582 million bpd, according to OPEC secondary sources.
But such a reduction may prove insufficient if Iraq insists on being exempted, and as Iran has said it is pumping 3.85 million bpd - about 185,000 bpd higher than estimates of the country's September production by OPEC secondary sources.
Riyadh has historically shouldered the lion's share of OPEC cuts. But if it took the same route this time, it could lose oil revenue if prices failed to rise while others increased production. The Saudis could also lose market share.
""They (the Saudis) are desperate for a deal,"" an OPEC source said.
Riyadh faces a second year of record budget deficits and is cutting the salaries of government employees, so keeping its output at current levels of 10.6-10.7 million bpd may not be economical. 
Industry sources say Aramco cannot sustain such high output for long, as it sees 10.1-10.2 million bpd as a more comfortable level also for its oilfields and reservoir management.
""It's a question of how do they want to spend the limited budget that they do have,"" an OPEC watcher said. 
""They have tough choices. Clearly as Saudi production goes up, their costs go up too."" 
THORNY ISSUES
The OPEC experts, including governors, national representatives and other technical officials, will this week discuss production allocations for every member country.
A major issue set to be raised by several countries is production estimates by secondary sources.
Saudi Arabia insists on using secondary sources when discussing production curbs and later monitoring compliance. This is likely to be opposed by some members, OPEC sources said.
For example, Iraq told OPEC its production in September was 4.775 million bpd, while secondary sources put the figure at 4.455 million bpd.
Venezuela is also dissatisfied with secondary-source estimations, the country's oil minister Eulogio Del Pino said this month.

""I think it is going to be very difficult for us and OPEC to reach a fair deal,"" said another OPEC source from a key Middle East oil producer.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil edged above $50 a barrel on Thursday as a further drop in U.S. crude inventories countered investor doubts that OPEC will be able to implement a production cut.
Crude inventories posted an unexpected drop of 553,000 barrels last week, and stocks of gasoline and distillates fell more than expected, raising hopes that a long-awaited market rebalancing is finally under way. [EIA/S]

The market was keeping an eye on escalating protests in Venezuela against the rule of President Nicolas Maduro, although there was no sign of any impact on the OPEC member's oil output. Venezuelan production has been falling this year as low prices hit investment.
Doubts about the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' supply cut deal weighed on the market.
""The problem of the oversupply will not resolve itself,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said. ""What will continue to dictate the price will be whether OPEC actually takes counteraction in the form of production cuts – yet there are growing doubts that it will."" 
OPEC agreed last month its first deal to restrain output in eight years to boost prices. But Iraq on Sunday called for Baghdad to be exempt, adding to the list of members seeking special treatment.
A technical meeting at OPEC's headquarters on Friday, and with officials from non-OPEC countries on Saturday, is supposed to come up with recommendations on how to implement the supply cutback to the oil ministers' next meeting on Nov. 30.

The OPEC plan is designed to speed up the removal of a supply glut that is keeping oil prices at less than half their level of mid-2014, cutting exporters' income and leading to investment cuts by oil companies worldwide.

U.S. crude oil inventories unexpectedly fell by 553,000 barrels last week to 468.2 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. However, the decline was centered on the West Coast, which is isolated from the rest of the network.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for December delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London tacked on 36 cents, or 0.72%, to $50.34 a barrel.
The contract slumped to $49.65 on Wednesday, the lowest since October 3, amid fading expectations of a coordinated production cut among major global oil producers.
Oil futures have been under pressure in recent days amid market skepticism over the implementation of a planned deal by OPEC to limit production.
The 14-member oil group reached an agreement to cap output to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held on the sidelines of an energy conference in Algeria late last month.
However, OPEC said it won’t finalize details on individual output quotas until its next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.
In September, the group’s production reached 33.4 million barrels a day.
The possibility that producers could walk away empty-handed from the upcoming meeting looms large after Iraq, Iran, Nigeria and Libya all signaled they might not take part in the proposed production cut deal. Russia’s unclear stance is also fueling uncertainty.

260,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2016 03:50AM ET</span>","Exclusive: India's tobacco industry, government face off ahead of WHO conference","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's $11 billion tobacco industry has urged the government to take a softer line on tobacco control efforts when it hosts a World Health Organization conference in New Delhi next month, but officials say the government will not bow to ""pressure tactics"".
Delegates from about 180 countries will attend the Nov. 7-12 WHO conference on the sole global anti-tobacco treaty: the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). In force since 2005, the treaty aims to deter tobacco use that kills around 6 million people a year.
The industry in India, the world's third-biggest tobacco producer, wants Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to soften its stance on what it says are tough FCTC measures that threaten livelihoods among the estimated 46 million people linked to the sector.
In documents obtained by a Reuters reporter under India's Right to Information law, industry and farmer groups wrote to officials across government asking to attend the conference and be part of India's delegation, in an effort to protect their interests.
Global tobacco firms have criticized the biennial event for not being transparent, in part because proceedings have in the past not been open to the public, including industry representatives.
The tussle comes at a time when the Indian industry is smarting from measures imposed this year forcing companies to print bigger health warnings on tobacco products.
A tobacco farmers' group this month questioned the legality of India implementing the FCTC treaty, and asked the Delhi High Court to compel the government to allow farmers to attend the WHO conference. A judge last week asked the government to ""consider"" the plea, but did not rule on the other requests.
""If we take them in the delegation, the government of India may feel embarrassed,"" said one health ministry official, who didn't want to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""We will not act on these (lobbying documents)"".
The FCTC secretariat in Geneva told Reuters it welcomes India's decision, saying its guidelines state that no country should have delegation members linked to the tobacco industry.
Conference decisions on treaty provisions - designed for eventual implementation at national level by signatories - have a direct bearing on the global tobacco industry that Euromonitor International estimates is worth $784 billion this year.
Topics for debate at the conference include alternative livelihoods for tobacco farmers, e-cigarettes and trade and investment issues.
LETTERS, SIGNATURE CAMPAIGNS
The nation's main cigarette industry body, the Tobacco Institute of India (TII), and farmer groups wrote to the agriculture ministry demanding to have their views represented and to be allowed into the WHO conference.
In a Sept. 28 letter, the TII said ""there is no obligation on any signatory to the FCTC to comply with or implement any provision of the FCTC"". The WHO, however, says the treaty is legally binding on its member countries.
The ministry also received a near-6,000-page petition signed by more than 100,000 farmers seeking protection from FCTC rules.
The TII - which represents cigarette makers including ITC, which is part-owned by  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS); and Godfrey Phillips, the local partner of Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) - also sent the health ministry a 'handbook' detailing how FCTC proposals are a threat to farmers' livelihoods.
It asked the government to ensure that ""unreasonable and impractical"" proposals are not adopted at the FCTC conference.
The TII did not respond to Reuters queries on the make-up of the Indian delegation or the legality of the FCTC.
In another letter, a group representing traditional Indian cigarette makers urged Modi to ensure the health ministry does not make any anti-tobacco commitments before or after the conference, fearing the potential impact on those tied to the industry.
The health ministry official said the government would consider farmers' views, but there was ""no soft corner for the industry"".

Smoking kills more than 1 million people a year in India, BMJ Global Health estimates. The WHO says tobacco-related diseases cost the country $16 billion annually.

Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on $2.35, or 0.19%, to $1,268.95 a troy ounce by 3:15AM ET (07:15GMT).
A day earlier, the yellow metal lost $7.00, or 0.55%, after touching a three-week high of $1,277.20.
The near-term outlook for gold remains cloudy as a recent string of positive U.S. economic data combined with hawkish remarks from key Fed officials heightened expectations for an interest rate hike before the end of the year.
The U.S. central bank's next meeting is in November, but a rate hike ahead of the presidential election is seen as unlikely.
Instead, traders are currently pricing in around a 78% chance of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was last at 98.70 early Thursday, within sight of a nine-month high of 99.09 touched earlier this week.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Later on Thursday, market participants will parse the latest data on U.S. durable goods, jobless claims and pending home sales. U.S. third-quarter growth figures scheduled for release on Friday could provide further hints on the future path of monetary policy.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for December delivery shed 1.8 cents, or 0.1%, to $17.60 a troy ounce during morning hours in London, while copper futures dipped 1.5 cents, or 0.68%, to $2.131 a pound.
Data released earlier showed that profit growth in China's industrial firms slowed sharply in September as some key manufacturing sectors stumbled on weak activity and rising debt, suggesting the world's second-biggest economy remains underpowered.
Industrial sector profits last month rose 7.7%, slowing markedly after surging 19.5% in August, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
China is the world’s largest copper consumer, accounting for nearly 45% of world consumption.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2016 11:00AM ET</span>",Iraq lures investors to boost its oil output as OPEC debates cuts,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov, Ahmed Rasheed and Ahmad Ghaddar
LONDON/BEIRUT (Reuters) - As OPEC gathers in Vienna next month to consider cutting its oil output, a lower profile event in Baghdad on the same day will signal Iraq's longer term ambition to do precisely the opposite.
Nov. 30 is both the date when OPEC ministers meet in the Austrian capital and the deadline set by Iraqi oil minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi for international firms to submit bids to help it develop 12 ""small and medium-sized"" oil fields.
Crude output in Iraq, OPEC's second largest producer, is already rising dramatically despite corruption, poor infrastructure and the fight against Islamic State. This is complicating OPEC's efforts to revive prices by making its first output cut since the 2008 global financial crisis.
Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are supposed to decide in Vienna which member states will make the cuts under an outline agreement struck last month.
Iraq says it will not reduce output because it needs oil money to combat Islamic State, and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi offered strictly limited support on Tuesday. ""We are prepared to cooperate on the correct basis,"" he said. ""We want oil prices to increase.""
At around $50 a barrel, crude prices are less than half their levels in mid-2014 and OPEC is seeking a production deal that will last at least six months.
Developing the 12 Iraqi oil fields, which lie in southern and central areas away from Islamic State strongholds, will take longer than that. Nevertheless, fellow OPEC members and rivals need read no further than the terms of the new tender to understand Baghdad's intentions.
The tender document sets quick output gains as the main requirement to win the contracts. Baghdad also wants maximum revenue, including from selling gas produced as a by-product of the crude extraction, rather than simply burning it off.
After achieving commercial production in the first phase of development, the Oil Ministry's document says, ""in the second phase, the sustainable high production level will be achieved, along with complete utilization of associated gas"".
With oil reserves of 143 billion barrels, Iraq controls almost every tenth barrel of oil in the ground in the world.
Aside from security problems, its crude is as cheap and easy to extract as in Saudi Arabia or Iran, but its energy industry suffered decades of under-investment under Saddam Hussein who was overthrown by a U.S.-led invasion in 2003.
Since then Iraq has signed deals with majors such as  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM),  BP  (L:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) to develop its giant fields. Production has almost doubled to 4.7 million barrels per day this year from 2.4 million bpd at the start of the decade.
But the growth has lagged the initial forecasts of production at 9 million bpd by 2018, equal to Saudi Arabia's. Held back by red tape, infrastructure constraints and difficult contract terms, Iraq is now targeting a more modest 5.5 million to 6 million bpd by 2020.
The oil ministry is in a hurry. ""Luaibi's plan is to boost production as quickly as possible to mitigate damage from lower prices, generate more revenues and have additional crude to repay contractors. This is the best way to keep everybody happy,"" a senior official with state-run South Oil Co said.
Another reason for the push to develop smaller fields is that talks with the majors on revising their contracts for operating the giant fields in southern Iraq have stalled. ""We can't just waste time and run round in circles with these tough talks,"" said the official, who declined to be named.
Under service contracts awarded since 2003, the oil ministry pays the operators a fixed dollar-denominated fee for every barrel of oil produced. While the model worked well for Baghdad when prices were high, it is now paying the same fees while its revenue from oil sales is significantly lower.
NEW CONTRACT MODEL
An executive from a company bidding for one of the new contracts said that Luaibi wants to leave his mark ""by ramping up production quickly"".
Iraq has already pre-qualified 19 companies for the round including giants such as  Glencore  (L:GLEN), Russia's Rosneft (MM:ROSN) and the UAE's Mubadala Oil.
The fields might be small or midsize by Iraqi standards, but they are significant by anybody else's. Nine of the fields together hold 2.3 billion barrels, equal to the entire reserves of Britain, which currently produces around 1 million bpd.
The new tenders also signal a departure from existing technical service contracts (TSCs), under which some oil producers complained of late payments by Baghdad.
""Luaibi wants to tear apart old contracts and make them work better for Iraq and oil firms. He is telling oil firms: keep investing - we will find a way to pay you,"" one of the executives involved in bidding said. 
New deals will be awarded based on bilateral and direct negotiations between the oil ministry and oil companies, moving closer to production sharing contracts (PSCs), when companies get a percentage of the oil output instead of being paid a fee for their work.
Their structures are likely to vary, reflecting the differing geologies of the various fields and consequently differing methods of extracting the crude.
""In a country like Iraq with so much diversity in the oil fields, it's impossible to have one contract system. This is an evolution towards a hybrid Iraqi contract model combining elements of TSC and PSC,"" managing director of UAE-based Manaar Energy Group Jaafar Altaie said.
CLAWING BACK MARKET SHARE 
Iraq has long said it believes it was cut out of the market in the 1990s, when the government of Saddam Hussein was under international sanctions, and hence it has lost its market share to rival OPEC producer Saudi Arabia. 
Officials say that as Iraq tries to retake its second city of Mosul from Islamic State, it should get the same exemptions from OPEC output restrictions as Iran, Nigeria and Libya, whose crude production has been hit by conflict and sanctions.
""We are fighting a vicious war,"" Luaibi said this week. 

Veteran oil watcher and founder of Petromatrix consultancy, Oliver Jakob, says a third of OPEC's member states are now pleading special circumstances for why they should not accept output caps. As a result, Jakob has come up with a new way of spelling out the OPEC acronym: the Organisation of Producers Exempt from Cuts.

The EU said China's export duties and export quotas on the raw materials - antimony, chromium, cobalt, copper, ferronickel, graphite, indium, lead, magnesia, talc, tantalum, and tin - appeared to be ""part of a continuing troubling industrial policy aimed at providing substantial competitive advantages for Chinese producers at the expense of producers and consumers in the EU and across the world"".

The WTO will consider the EU's request for a dispute settlement panel on Nov. 8, the EU said.
""The EU regrets China's unwillingness to bring its legislation concerning the export of raw materials in line with its WTO commitments and is therefore once again challenging China's export regime,"" it said in a statement.
The EU said some of the rare materials in question are among the 20 raw materials that critical to Europe's economy.
China's position as a leading global producer of these raw materials means its export restrictions give it the ability to affect global supply and pricing, the EU said.

Natural gas for delivery in November on the New York Mercantile Exchange touched a daily low of $2.706 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since September 8. It was last at $2.742 by 9:40AM ET (13:40GMT), down 3.2 cents, or 1.15%.
Meanwhile, the more actively-traded December contract sank 6.6 cents, or 2.1%, to $3.083 per million British thermal units.
It plunged 17.0 cents, or 5.12%, on Tuesday, as forecasts showing unseasonably warm temperatures across the U.S. Midwest in the days ahead dampened demand expectations for the heating fuel.
Market participants awaited weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build of approximately 70 billion cubic feet in the week ended October 21.
That compares with a gain of 77 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 62 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 76 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.836 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 1.2% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 4.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas futures have been under heavy selling pressure in recent days as warmer-than-average weather in key gas-consuming regions in the U.S. ignited speculation that a mild winter will curtail demand for the heating fuel and leave a glut of it in storage, weighing on prices next year.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather reduces demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.

LONDON (Reuters) - As commodity margins flat-line, the number of traders will shrink as existing trading firms consolidate and digital rivals emerge, U.S. consultancy Oliver Wyman said in its annual commodity trading report.
With the exception of oil and natural gas boosted by volatility last year, growth across commodities is plateauing with combined margins stuck at around $44 billion per year in 2014 and 2015, the report said.
Wyman sees digitization as the game-changer in the next few years that will force independent traders such as  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), Trafigura and Vitol, as well as the trading arms at integrated oil companies like Shell (LON:RDSa) and  BP  (LON:BP), to become ever more nimble and automate many of their activities.
Little room will be left for mid-sized traders to expand beyond niche markets and it will be ""close to impossible for banks to return back to physical trading.""
Until now the oil and gas industry has remained largely immune to technology leaps. But while banks trading physical commodities may be a thing of the past, Wyman sees their role as ""pioneering blockchain technologies"" for commodity financing.
Blockchain works by creating permanent, public ""ledgers"" of all transactions that could potentially replace complicated clearing and settlement systems.
""The first ones to adopt the new technology, like blockchain, will have a significant competitive advantage,"" said Roland Rechtsteiner, a partner and energy specialist at Oliver Wyman. 
Marco Dunand, chief executive of Swiss-based trader Mercuria, recently told the Reuters Commodities Summit that blockchain payments could slash payment costs in a system stuck in the ""17th or 18th century"" by some 30 percent.
NEW SET OF PLAYERS
While traditional energy sources and traders will continue for the foreseeable future, ""an army of new low-cost digital contenders"" is breaking into the power market. 
Technology giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) already have energy wholesalers as subsidiaries. Online platforms like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and transport providers like Uber will use revenue from their core services to sell power for far less, the report said.
With Google using an equivalent amount of electricity as is used to power 200,000 homes, it could cut costs with solar power plants while leveraging its wide customer base and expertise in data processing to carve out a share in power markets, it said.
In Britain for instance, once smart meter data becomes available in the next year or so, digital specialists will be able to offer new services, Rechtsteiner said.
Over the last five years, independent traders traded 30 percent more oil, currently averaging 4 million barrels per day (bpd) versus asset-backed traders at 5-10 million bpd. Liquefied natural gas trading has also risen.

Wyman said that while the acquisition of physical assets by independent traders allowed them to grab more market share, they will have to do more and also venture deeper into utilities, particularly from renewable energies, and the trading and recycling of plastics as hydrocarbon use in transport declines.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2016 04:16PM ET</span>",Iraqi leaders lobby OPEC's Barkindo for an oil output cut exemption,"By Maher Chmaytelli and Saif Hameed
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq told a top OPEC official on Tuesday it was ready to cooperate in reaching a deal on supply cuts to support oil prices as long as it kept its output at near current levels. 
""We are prepared to cooperate on the correct basis,"" Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said, commenting on the visit by OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo to Baghdad.
""We stress the need to exempt Iraq from any agreement that would lower its production,"" said a statement from influential Shi'ite cleric Ammar al-Hakim after a meeting with Barkindo.
Hakim is the president of the National Alliance, a coalition of the main Shi'ite political groups including Abadi's Dawa party. The Shi'ite community form a majority in Iraq.
Barkindo, who is trying to cement an accord on supply cuts that would support sagging oil prices, was in Baghdad ahead of OPEC's meeting on Nov. 30.
OPEC's second largest producer after Saudi Arabia, Iraq says it will not cut output because it needs oil money to fight Islamic State. Iraqi officials say it should get the same exemptions as Iran, Nigeria and Libya -- whose crude output has been hit by wars and sanctions.
They have also hinted that they may agree to a cut, but from a higher baseline, which would amount to preserving output at the same level. Iraq says it produces more than OPEC's estimate.
""We want oil prices to increase,"" Abadi told a news conference in Baghdad. ""There was a misunderstanding about the figures."" 
Iraq puts its September output at 4.774 million bpd and its production could rise a little in October. OPEC's secondary sources put it at 4.455 million bpd.
Barkindo met Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi who expressed ""support for the efforts of the secretary general"", according to statement on the oil ministry's website.

Falah al-Amri, head of state oil marketer SOMO, said Iraq will not go back below 4.7 million barrels per day, ""not for OPEC, not for anybody else"".

284,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2016 02:01PM ET</span>","On the ballot: two clashing visions of how America will power its cars, homes","By Valerie Volcovici and Devika Krishna Kumar
(Reuters) - Forget the accusations of groping, bigotry and email mismanagement.
If the American voter had to choose between Republican nominee Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton based on their energy policies alone, the presidential election would still be a remarkable drama, amounting to the biggest referendum on global climate change since the term was coined.
How the country decides on Nov. 8 will have far-reaching implications for the price of electricity and gas at the pump, as well as the future of the U.S. energy industry, which employs about 10 million people.
Trump's vision is an America where oil derricks pump furiously again, coal miners get back to work, and the country puts its own economy ahead of foreign nations worried about the effects of fossil fuels on sea levels, droughts, and storms.
Clinton sees an America where half a billion solar panels power homes, cars run on electricity, oil use is cut by a third, and the clean energy sector provides a deep well of new jobs supported by government mandates and subsidies. 
""At a very basic level, it would be a climate vote,"" said Sarah Emerson, the head of Energy Security Analysis Inc in Boston. ""Do you want fossil fuels, or renewables?""
MAKE AMERICA DRILL AGAIN
Trump has said he wants to unleash a U.S. “energy revolution” by streamlining environmental regulation, easing infrastructure permitting and pulling the country out of a global pact to combat climate change – moves he says would promote increased oil and gas drilling and revive the dying coal mining industry without compromising air and water quality.
The proposals align neatly with both the Republican Party’s opposition to government overreach, and Trump’s own campaign theme of making “America Great Again” by restoring traditional industries, including many that have been hurt by international trade agreements.
While the plan has earned him some support within an oil and gas industry naturally opposed to regulation, it has also given rise to skepticism among even his closest allies over whether he can deliver.
“Obama hasn’t shut down drilling – what has shut down drilling is price,” Texas oil billionaire T. Boone Pickens, a Trump supporter, told Reuters. “I don’t know what Trump can do to help the industry.”
A technology-driven drilling boom has pushed U.S. oil and gas production up 70 percent since President Barack Obama took office in 2008, making America the top producer in the world, but it has also triggered a slump in prices as demand has failed to keep up.
Oil prices are running at four-month highs around $50 a barrel after the OPEC cartel signaled in September it may make its first production cut in eight years, but prices remain less than half their levels from mid-2014. 
While the price crash has been a boon for consumers and energy-intensive businesses, dozens of energy companies have gone bankrupt, putting blue collar workers in the coal mines, shale fields and oil rigs out of work. 
Critics have said Trump’s plan to revive natural gas drilling would finish off the very coal industry he promises to restore, because the two fuels compete. It would “seem to defy basic market laws of supply and demand,” said Jason Bordoff, a former energy adviser to Obama.
The coal industry, once a large employer in parts of America, now employs less than 60,000 miners. It has become a symbol of Trump's vow to revive dying industries. Clinton suffered political damage when she said ""we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""
Trump’s energy plan would also force the United States to make an abrupt turnabout on the environment: He wants to withdraw from the global climate change pact agreed in Paris last year. 
He has called climate change a hoax and has argued the Paris deal would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars and put it at a disadvantage. 
Trump wants to rescind the Clean Power Plan to limit carbon output and downgrade the Environmental Protection Agency to a commission, not a cabinet level agency, and refocus it on its “core mission: clean air and clean water for all Americans, regardless of race or income.”
An oil industry lobbyist in Washington D.C., who asked not to be named, said that even if Trump’s policies were unlikely to solve the root problem facing the industry right now – the low price of oil and gas – his ideas were still mainly welcomed.
“Regulation is a killer, and if it can be streamlined, it helps,” he said.
Trump’s campaign has drawn about $99,000 from employees of the oil and gas industry since July, when he was formally nominated, while Clinton has received about $114,000 from the industry over the same period, according to the latest federal campaign finance disclosures.
CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER
Environmental advocates argue that a failure to agree on strong measures like the Paris accord would doom the world to ever-hotter average temperatures, bringing with them deadlier storms, more frequent droughts and rising sea levels as polar ice caps melt.
Clinton says she wants to address that by making America a “clean energy superpower."" Her plan calls for phasing out fossil fuels, embracing clean energy sources like solar and wind, strengthening environmental protections and leading the world in curbing carbon dioxide emissions blamed for climate change.
“We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That’s a lot of jobs. That’s a lot of new economic activity,” Clinton said in the first presidential debate in September.
Solar development is aided by a federal tax credit worth 30 percent of the cost of a system. That credit was set to expire at the end of this year, but received a five-year extension from Congress in late 2015. Even so, the cost of electricity from large-scale solar installations has dropped to a level that is now comparable to natural gas-fired power, even without incentives.
Clinton has also signaled increased regulation of fracking to prevent water and air pollution, continued support for the Obama administration’s efforts to curb carbon output that would pressure fuels like coal, and a tougher approach to infrastructure permitting.
Her approach appears much more likely than Trump’s to lift consumer prices for gasoline, heating oil, and electricity, given that increased regulation typically increases costs of production, many analysts said. 
Still, Clinton will likely face stiff resistance from U.S. Congress - if Republicans retain control of one or both houses. She could follow in Obama's footsteps by relying on executive orders to implement her agenda, but opponents would almost certainly challenge her in the courts.
Jay Faison, a North Carolina entrepreneur who calls himself a conservative advocate for clean energy, agrees with the need for more lower-carbon sources of energy, but says Trump’s plans to cut regulation could provide a more effective way to get there. They could potentially make it easier to build nuclear power plants and hydro-electric dams, which produce no carbon dioxide, for example.
Environmentalists, who have helped mobilize mass protests against energy infrastructure projects during Obama's presidency, hate Trump's proposals. But they are also suspicious of Clinton. She promoted fracking technology to European allies while America’s top diplomat to help them reduce their dependence on Russia, according to leaked diplomatic cables, and was slow to oppose the Keystone XL pipeline proposal that would have piped in more oil sands from Alberta to U.S. refineries.
“It’s a shame that were going to have to spend four or eight years pressuring her at every turn but we will,” said Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, which advocates a complete halt to fossil fuels development.

Baker Hughes, which in May abandoned a merger with closest rival  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) due to opposition from antitrust regulators, said total costs and expenses fell 31.2 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.
The company said in July it expected to save an annualized $500 million in costs by the end of 2016.
Baker Hughes said on Tuesday it expected activity in North America to modestly increase as customers slowly begins to ramp up activity.
Larger rival  Schlumberger Ltd  (N:SLB), the world's No.1 oilfield services provider, said on Friday there were early signs of recovery in industry activity in most parts of the world. 
The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States this week rose by 11 in the week to Oct.21, the most in two months.
However, Baker Hughes said it expected activity declines in the international community, with continued pricing pressure. 
Net loss attributable to Baker Hughes widened to $429 million, or $1 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $159 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier.
The company said it recorded after-tax charges of $365 million related to asset and goodwill impairments, restructuring and litigation settlements.
Excluding items, the company reported a loss of 15 cents per share, smaller than the 44 cents analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

YENAGOA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigerian militant group the Niger Delta Avengers said it attacked an oil pipeline in Nigeria's restive southern energy hub on Tuesday and warned international oil companies (IOCs) not to carry out repairs on damaged energy infrastructure.
Nigeria's oil output, typically close to 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd), fell to less than 1.3 million bpd this spring as militants bombed energy facilities. But, amid a ceasefire announced by the Avengers in August, the petroleum ministry said oil production had risen to 1.9 million bpd.
The Avengers, which declared the break in hostilities to pursue talks with the government, said on its website that the group ""took down  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) Escravos export pipeline at Escravos offshore"" at around 3:45 a.m. (0445 GMT).
""This action is to further warn all IOCs that when we warn that there should be no repairs pending negotiation/dialogue with the people of the Niger Delta, it means there should be no repairs,"" it said on its website.
Collins Edema, a local community leader, said: ""We heard of it at the offshore but no one can ascertain the extent of the damage."" A Chevron spokeswoman could not immediately be reached.
The group has said it wants a greater share of the OPEC member's wealth to go to the Niger Delta, where most of the country's crude is produced. Government sources told Reuters the government would hold a meeting with community leaders and militant representatives next week.
It said any attempt to use talks with the government as a distraction ""will halt the dialogue process"". It is the first attack claimed by the Avengers since late September, when it said it attacked a crude export line as a ""wake-up call"".

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil edged up on Tuesday ahead of the release of U.S. crude inventory data, which in recent weeks has provided bullish surprises, but a flurry of top-level comments from OPEC members regarding chances of an output cut kept a lid on prices.
International Brent crude oil futures rose 35 cents to $51.81 per barrel at 0910 GMT from their last close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures turned positive, gaining 37 cents to $50.89 a barrel, after being negative throughout much of Asia trading.
The private American Petroleum Institute is due to publish its weekly crude stocks estimates on Tuesday at 2030 GMT, followed by the official Energy Information Administration data due on Wednesday.
""Crude oil does not want to drop the support until it sees if it can use the weekly U.S. statistics for another test of an upside break-out,"" analysts at Petromatrix said in a note. 
A Reuters poll showed that U.S. crude inventories were forecast to have risen last week by a likely 800,000 barrels to 469.5 million barrels. That came after a fall of more than 5 million barrels in the week to Oct. 14. [EIA/S]
Analysts said a leak in a pipeline leading out of the huge Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub should lead to more build up of stocks in the coming weeks.
However, official inventory data has surprised by showing drawdowns in six of the seven past weeks, including the largest fall in stocks since 1999 when analysts foresaw a build. U.S. crude stocks are closely watched to gauge supply and demand in the world's biggest crude consumer.
The verbal jockeying among OPEC's 14 member states ahead of a Nov. 30 meeting that may lead to a cut in output continued this week, with Iraq emerging as a possible dissenter and non-member Russia as a potentially compliant collaborator.
Iraq, the second-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said on Sunday it wanted to be exempt from output curbs as it needed more money to fight Islamic State militants.
Until there is more clarity on the planned cuts, which OPEC hopes will be coordinated with non-members such as Russia, analysts said oil prices would likely remain range-bound but volatile around current levels.

""Expect more of this choppy interplay until more concrete news emerges, as speculative buying runs into record producer selling of the futures contracts for hedging,"" Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA in Singapore, said.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Energy ministers from Russia and Qatar along with OPEC's secretary general discussed possible joint action to stabilize the oil market, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said ahead of OPEC's meeting next month aiming to cement a deal agreed in Algiers.
Russia is the world's largest oil producer but not a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its budget has been hit by low oil prices, the same as for many OPEC nations. 
Novak, in Vienna after visiting Saudi Arabia over the weekend for talks with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, said sharp falls in the price of crude threatened to trigger an oil deficit and unpredictable volatility in prices. 
""That's why ... (an oil output) freeze or even a cut for a certain period of time is a right decision for global energy ... Being a short-term measure, an oil output cap may help to lower volatility in the market and make it more stable,"" Novak said.
Last month in Algiers, OPEC agreed modest output cuts that are due to be set in stone in the coming weeks. The goal is to trim production to a range of 32.50-33.0 million barrels per day (bpd).
""We have in detail discussed ... current situation (on oil market) and different mechanisms and options of joint actions,"" Novak told a briefing after talks with his Qatari counterpart Mohammed al-Sada and OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo.
Russia is ramping up its oil output amid weak oil prices, as weak rouble and investments made in previous years are helping its oil sector. In September, Russian oil output hit another post-Soviet high of 11.1 million barrels per day (bpd). 
On Monday, Novak repeated that an oil output freeze is ""an effective tool Russia is ready for (in a move) to balance the market"". Yet he said that Moscow was considering ""different options,"" but declined to provide details. 
MORE TO COME
Russia plans to bring another oilfield on stream this month, Lukoil's Pyakyakhinskoye in the Yamal Arctic region, in addition to Messoyakha launched by Gazprom Neft (MM:SIBN) and Rosneft (MM:ROSN) last month.
Rosneft, the world's top listed oil producer by output, plans to launch its Suzun field in Siberia this year as well, with Lukoil planning to put its Caspian Filanovsky field in operation by the end of 2016, adding more to the global glut. 
On Monday, Novak declined to say at which levels Russia would be ready to cap its output, adding that lower-tier officials from OPEC and non-OPEC countries, including Russia, will be working on terms of a possible deal on Oct. 28-29 in Vienna. 
OPEC's Barkindo said in opening remarks to Monday's meeting that Russia and OPEC were ""committed to stable and predictable markets"".

""While there are signs that the rebalancing of the fundamentals is under way with overall non-OPEC supply contracting this year and demand ... at healthy levels, the large stock overhang continues to be a major concern,"" Barkindo said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas industry workers have contributed only slightly more money to the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton than to Republican Donald Trump since the two clinched their parties' nominations for the White House, according to Reuters' review of federal disclosures.
The nearly even support suggests ambivalence in the industry between two rivals who have put forward wildly different energy visions. Trump calls for a drastic reduction in regulations to bolster drilling, while Clinton advocates tougher environmental protections and more renewables.
Employees in the industry gave Clinton $114,141 and Trump $99,302 since July 1, Reuters found in reviewing individual campaign contributions exceeding $200 and donations funneled through their joint fundraising committees. Both were officially nominated by their parties in mid-July.
Several oil and gas industry employees reached by Reuters said they did not donate just because of the candidates' energy policies. Most requested anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the election.
""I am moved by the disturbing nature of what I see in Trump's vision for America on trade, the economy and national security,"" said American Gas Association head Dave McCurdy, who has contributed to Clinton's campaign.
He added, however, that he agreed with Clinton on reducing carbon dioxide emissions blamed for climate change and felt natural gas would play a role in that effort.
The association has not endorsed a candidate.
Continental Resources Inc Chief Executive Officer Harold Hamm, who has contributed repeatedly to Trump's campaign, has argued in favor of the candidate's energy policies. Hamm has said bolstering U.S. drilling would reduce dependence on Middle East oil, whose proceeds he says finance terrorist attacks.
A Continental official did not respond to a request for comment from Hamm.
An energy lobbyist based in Washington said he understood the industry's ambivalence. ""Clinton is pro-regulation, which hurts,"" he said, requesting anonymity. ""And Trump has no record in the industry, so there's no evidence he understands the issues."" 
Clinton had far exceeded Trump in campaign contributions from industry employees during the primaries, but donations to the Republican side of the ledger were split among a much larger number of candidates than on the Democratic side.

During the Republican primaries, the industry had taken an early liking to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, giving him more than all his rivals combined, before he dropped out of the race in February.

301,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2016 11:11AM ET</span>",Chevron sees big profits in California despite regulations,"By Ernest Scheyder
RICHMOND, Calif. (Reuters) - The land of liberal politics, electric cars and strict pollution controls might seem like an odd place to drop $1 billion into a 115-year-old oil refinery.
 Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) sees an entirely different landscape in California: a uniquely isolated market, closed to new competitors, where the price of gasoline can skyrocket when even one refinery goes down.
The company plans to make a fortune here - in part from the expected misfortunes of rival refineries in the state, who after Chevron's renovations will have older technologies and potentially more frequent outages. 
The $1 billion investment will go into Chevron's refinery in Richmond, an industrial city northeast of San Francisco. Analysts said the renovations, started this summer and scheduled for completion by 2019, will likely make the plant more reliable than the 13 other refineries operating in a state with high and volatile gasoline prices.
That means Chevron may be well-positioned to profit from rivals' breakdowns, such as the February 2015 explosion at Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Mobil's refinery in Torrance. The outage kept the refinery from returning to full capacity for more than a year and pushed state gasoline prices to an 18-month high, boosting margins for other state refineries.
Outages aside, Chevron also stands to profit from serving the California gasoline market, the world's third largest, behind only the rest of the United States and China.
""Californians like clean air, and they like helping the environment,"" said Dave Hackett, a refinery analyst at Stillwater Associates. ""But at the end of the day, they're not going to give up their cars.""
For a graphic showing surging gasoline use in California, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2ePvIRs
The state’s thicket of fossil-fuel regulations has an upside for companies that can navigate it - most notably, a near certainty that no new competitors will open in California, which had more than twice as many refineries in the mid-1980s. 
That trend may continue. Among the state’s ambitious clean air goals is Governor Jerry Brown’s target of generating half of California’s power from renewable sources by 2030.
'INSULATED MARKET'
California is also the nation’s largest auto market and an island of expensive retail gasoline.
California’s pump prices are the highest in the contiguous United States because the state requires a one-off blend to curb smog, which few refineries produce. Gasoline refined in nearby Washington state, for instance, can't be sold in California.
Transportation costs also drive up gas prices. With no gasoline pipelines flowing into the state, fuel must be shipped by truck or boat. ""To be a refiner in California is difficult and tough, but it can also be lucrative,"" said John Auers, a refinery industry consultant with Turner Mason. ""It's an insulated market, and that protects your margins.”
Amid the high prices, California Attorney General Kamala Harris launched a probe earlier this year into whether Chevron and other state refiners have manipulated gasoline prices. The companies deny the charges. Investigators are specifically examining price hikes during periods of refinery outages, according to a subpoena from Harris, who is also a U.S. Senate candidate. 
Chevron has said it will cooperate with the investigation.
Chevron’s Richmond refinery is the state’s largest producer of jet fuel, supplying San Francisco's airport at a time when air travel demand continues to soar. 
""Clearly, we see continued opportunity within California,"" said Joe Naylor, Chevron's vice president for policy, government and public affairs. 
The refinery renovation, he said, ""is a sign that we remain committed to being in California as long as the business environment remains conducive to us."" 
Chevron declined to detail expected margins for the Richmond plant, but said it expects to recoup its investment.
BICYCLES IN BEVERLY HILLS?
Brown signed a law two months ago that aims to cut California's greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. The bill was unpopular among the state's oil companies who claimed it would push up consumer gas prices, which already average 57 cents more per gallon than the U.S., according to AAA, a nonprofit association of U.S. travel clubs.
Chevron's refinery, however, will meet or exceed California's emissions, safety and other environmental standards, the company said.
Chevron is replacing its refinery's antiquated hydrogen plant - a crucial component for a refinery - and installing new hydrogen-purifying equipment and building a new cogeneration power plant, which uses heat from the refining process to generate electricity, lowering Chevron's power costs. In Richmond, a city of roughly 100,000 that was a major shipbuilding port during World War Two, residents who had fought Chevron's Richmond expansion efforts.
Environmental groups cited a refinery fire in 2012 at the Richmond plant in arguing that Chevron cannot safely operate the plant in a densely populated region. Chevron rejects that criticism. ""If we look at the operation of our facilities around the world, I would stack our record up against anybody,"" said Naylor, the Chevron executive.
California's political and regulatory environment has driven other oil giants away from the state. Exxon sold its Torrance refinery - its only California refinery - to PBF Energy last summer for $537 million, saying the sale was part of a ""strategic assessment of the site and how it fits with our refining portfolio."" 
Oil producer Occidental Petroleum Corp fled California in 2014 for Texas, well known for its business-friendly policies.
""Maybe the people in Beverly Hills should park their Rolls Royces and drive bicycles going forward,"" Steve Chazen, then-CEO of Oxy said in early 2014 when detailing the company's exit from the state and describing his frustration with its energy regulations. 
But while others may leave, Chevron's rival California refiners see opportunity as well. 
Tom O'Malley, CEO of PBF Energy, called California ""a very attractive market,"" and noted the company bought Exxon's Torrance refinery ""at a very attractive purchase price.""
Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), which owns two California refineries, told investors earlier this year that demand in California for gasoline continues to rise. 

Company Chief Executive Greg Garland put it this way: ""Margins have been very good in California.""

Iraqi oil minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi said Baghdad wants to be exempt from any production cut the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is aiming to achieve.
Falah al-Amiri, head of Iraqi state oil marketer SOMO, added that Iraq's market share had been compromised by the wars it has fought since the 1980s.
""We should be producing 9 million (barrels per day) if it wasn't for the wars,"" he said.
OPEC announced plans last month to reduce its output to between 32.5 million barrels per day (bpd) and 33 million bpd, from September's 33.39 million bpd. The group will iron out the details of how it will hit the target at its next meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30. 
""A decision to cut to 33 million bpd should keep the crude price basis Brent in the $50-$60 band, not least because it shows that Saudi policy has changed, that OPEC is serious and can rise above political disagreements,"" David Hufton, of consultancy PVM, said in a note. 
Iraq said it could raise output slightly this month from September's 4.774 million bpd.
A short-term cap in oil output would reduce market volatility, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday at a meeting with OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo, as both look to stabilize prices.
Comments from Iran's deputy oil minister Amir Hossein Zamaninia, however, helped to push prices higher earlier in the session. He said Tehran would encourage other OPEC members to join an output freeze, adding that $55-$60 a barrel is a fair price to bring stability to the market.
Analysts said that oil markets, which have been dogged by two years of oversupply, might be rebalancing in terms of production and consumption.

The 83 protesters were arrested near the site of the Dakota Access pipeline on numerous charges ranging from assault on a peace officer to rioting and criminal trespass, the Morton County Sheriff's department said in a statement. 
Law enforcement was alerted early Saturday morning to an SUV on private property near the pipeline construction site and found that four men had attached themselves to the vehicle, according to the sheriff's department. Police removed the men from the SUV before arresting them. 
Later, around 300 protesters marched toward pipeline construction equipment and tried to breach a police line keeping them from the equipment, the sheriff's department said. 
Some were pepper sprayed by law enforcement. One protester attempted to grab a can of pepper spray from an officer, resulting in the officer being sprayed. 
The demonstration closed a section of a local highway, but it was reopened on Saturday afternoon. 
""Today’s situation clearly illustrates what we have been saying for weeks, that this protest is not peaceful or lawful,"" sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said in a statement. 
""It was obvious to our officers who responded that the protesters engaged in escalated unlawful tactics and behavior during this event. This protest was intentionally coordinated and planned by agitators with the specific intent to engage in illegal activities."" 
The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and environmental activists have been protesting construction of the 1,100-mile (1,886-km) pipeline in North Dakota for several months, saying it threatens the water supply and sacred sites. Numerous protesters have been arrested near the pipeline. 
It was unclear who organized and led the protest. A spokesman for the Standing Rock Sioux could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The pipeline, being built by a group of companies led by Energy Transfer Partners LP, would be the first to bring Bakken shale from North Dakota directly to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
Supporters say it would provide a safer and more cost-effective way to transport Bakken shale to the U.S. Gulf than by road or rail.

Earlier this week, pipeline equipment in Iowa was intentionally lit on fire causing about $2 million in damage, according to local authorities and company officials.

""Through wise policies and increased cooperation, it is possible to defeat such plots and enmity,"" state broadcaster IRIB quoted Khamenei as saying.

313,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2016 04:10AM ET</span>","Cleaner, but not leaner: China steel mills defy capacity cutbacks","By Ruby Lian and Manolo Serapio Jr
SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese steel mills are becoming cleaner every month as Beijing pushes to curb its smoke-stack industries. But they're not getting any leaner.
Despite efforts to step up environmental checks and trim out excess capacity, steel output by the world's top producer has risen year-on-year for the past seven months.
As emissions cuts will mean steel mills are better able to meet stricter government standards, Beijing may find it more difficult to cut overcapacity in a sprawling industry.
For now, domestic demand from infrastructure and construction has been robust, absorbing most of the extra supply. But a steeper slowdown in the world's second-largest economy could force mills to ramp up sales abroad.
That could rekindle tensions with Europe and the United States, major trading partners which have for years accused China of dumping its excess steel overseas, hitting producers and hurting global prices.
The issue took center stage at a recent G20 summit in China when world leaders pledged to work to address excess output. 
China's top steel producing city of Tangshan in Hebei province illustrates Beijing's dilemma. Hosting a months-long international horticultural show, Tangshan had a major six-month clean-up to ensure blue skies for visiting dignitaries, including the country's president Xi Jinping.
Industry experts predicted this would see a big drop in output in a province that accounts for a fifth of national production, going some way to realizing government goals on output and capacity cuts.
But production dipped by far less than expected as mills sustained output even as they cleaned themselves up.
They could do this largely because steel prices  have risen 40 percent this year, and strong domestic demand is expected to continue, underpinning those increases, though exports have fallen to their lowest since February.
By end-September, China had completed more than 80 percent of this year's capacity reduction goals in coal and steel, said Huang Libin, an official at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
China has targeted a cut of 45 million tonnes from its surplus steel capacity this year.
But the battle to tackle excess capacity and curb pollution has failed to dent production. China's annual crude steel surplus is estimated at around 300 million tonnes, three times the annual output of the world's second-biggest producer, Japan.
""If steel mills are profitable, there's no reason for the government to order them to reduce production if they meet environmental criteria,"" said Xia Junyan, investment manager at Hangzhou CIEC Trading Co in Shanghai.
BATTLEGROUND IN TANGSHAN
While many of Tangshan's small mills have closed, bigger plants have installed or upgraded equipment since a nationwide environmental crackdown began in 2014, industry sources say.
Some were forced to cut sinter production - processing iron ore fines into lumps - for a few days in September and October to clear the skies during the recent horticultural show. But the city's about 150 blast furnaces only dropped output three times - in June, July and September - and for only a couple of days during the six-month clean-up, according to a survey by industry consultancy Custeel.com.
The biggest drop was in early June when operating rates fell below 65 percent as leaders from central and eastern Europe gathered in Tangshan for talks on economic ties, followed by another fall in July as the city prepared to commemorate a 1976 earthquake that killed at least 250,000 people.
Otherwise, mills have been operating at above 80 percent of capacity this year, the Custeel.com survey showed.
""Production can be flexible. Even if production at steel mills is hit temporarily by the environmental crackdown, they can increase production later to offset the losses,"" said Xia at Hangzhou CIEC Trading.
The government looks ready to keep targeting Tangshan's mills in its war on winter smog, with Hebei province last week imposing what it calls ""special emission restrictions"" on local steel mills, according to a policy document.
Last month, the National Development and Reform Commission, China's state planner, said it punished hundreds of steel and coal companies nationwide for violating environmental and safety regulations. Some were forced to close or cut output.

Demand is stabilizing, OPEC production has peaked (and will fall if cuts are implemented), and global inventory declines imply that the market is more balanced than many believe,"" Neil Beveridge of Bernstein Energy said in a note to clients.
But Olivier Jakob, oil analyst at Petromatrix said: ""We have been cautious in the current (oil) flat price rally, based on our forecast of an OPEC supply surge in the fourth quarter and a widening of the Brent contango."" 
A rise in the dollar (DXY) on Friday to touch a seven-month high against a basket of currencies, in its third straight week of gains, prevented oil prices from pushing higher.

317,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2016 01:00AM ET</span>","Asia's oil markets are tightening as China cuts output, fuel stocks dwindle","By Seng Li Peng and Mark Tay
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - From sharp cuts to Chinese oil production to falling inventories of refined fuel products, signs are mounting that Asia's oil markets are slowly returning to balance.
Global inventories of refined products - made up from light and middle distillates like gasoline and diesel, as well as residual fuel such as fuel oil - have all fallen since the beginning of the month. They are now at or below levels seen this time last year, data in Thomson Reuters Datastream shows.
The drawdowns come after China, Asia's biggest oil consumer and a top-5 global producer, this week reported a 9.8 percent fall in output for September, amounting to one of the deepest cuts on record.
The falling stocks in most oil trading hubs, including Singapore, Europe's ARA (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Antwerp), and in the United States, as well as China's declining production, are signs of a market coming closer into balance following two years of consistent crude and refined product oversupply. 
""The oil products market is in the midst of rebalancing – it started in the U.S. and Europe a few months back, and in Asia the rebalancing is starting to show,"" said Nevyn Nah of energy consulting firm Energy Aspects.
Despite a slight increase over the past week, Singapore's refined product stocks have fallen from over 58 million barrels last May to below 50 million barrels, according to government data. [O/SING]
""After two years of oversupply and sharply rising inventories, inventories may have peaked as supply and demand comes back into balance,"" Neil Beveridge of Bernstein Energy said on Friday in a note to clients.
Analysts said the tighter markets were a result of both strengthening demand and tightening supplies.
FROM GLUT TO SQUEEZE?
A tightening fuel market is also visible in Singapore's refinery margins, which have improved despite rising feedstock crude prices.
Gasoline profits have soared from just $1.70 per barrel in July to almost $10, while overall Singapore refinery margins started picking up in August and have since jumped from $2.50 a barrel to around $6.20.
""The net result of these developments implies that prices could have further to run as markets tighten,"" said Bernstein's Beveridge, who expected crude prices to average $60 per barrel in 2017 and $70 a barrel in 2018.
Given strong demand, especially in Asia, and tightening supplies, ""there could be a substantial supply shortfall in 2017 which could go a long way to draining inventories,"" he added.
Yet for the moment, traders say Asia's markets are still some way off a squeeze.
China's gasoline and diesel exports, which contributed heavily to Asia's refined product glut, jumped again in September, customs data showed on Friday, as its refiners continue to produce more fuel than China consumes.

And with the refinery maintenance season coming to an end soon, refined product supplies will soon start to pick up.

Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 468.7 million barrels as of last week, the EIA said. The report came after industry group the American Petroleum Institute said late Tuesday that U.S. crude oil stocks fell by a surprise 3.8 million barrels last week.

OPEC is expected to complete details of the proposed production cut at its next official meeting on November 30.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday on profit-taking, after markets rallied the previous day on another unseasonal draw in U.S. crude oil stocks helping bullish sentiment from an expectation of an OPEC-led cut in production.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures (CLc1) were at $50.78 per barrel at 1230 GMT (0830 EDT), down 82 cents from their previous close. Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $51.85 per barrel, also down 82 cents.
WTI futures settled at a 15-month high the previous day, fueled by a fall in U.S. crude stocks by 5.2 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 14 to 468.7 million barrels.
""Today we are drifting lower with WTI crude oil finding resistance at $52. The dollar gained some strength during the Asian session which also helped trigger some profit taking ahead of today's ECB meeting,"" said Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank's head of commodity research.
The dollar stayed close to a seven-month high against a currency basket (DXY) and a three-month high to the euro ahead of a European Central Bank (ECB) news conference. Oil extended losses a touch after the ECB held interest rates.
Analysts at JBC noted that U.S. crude oil stocks have been depleted by 26.5 million barrels in the past seven weeks which was unusual even when taking into account hurricanes that can disrupt oil production and supplies by tankers.
""The counterseasonal nature of the draw is also notable as we ought to be seeing builds on the back of fall refinery maintenance.""
This reduction in stocks in the world's largest oil consumer has added to bullish sentiment that arose after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) proposed to cut or at least curb oil production.
While many remain skeptical about OPEC's ability to strike and effectively implement a deal at a Nov. 30 meeting, the notion of coordination among the 14 member states has at least put a floor under Brent and WTI prices at around $50 a barrel.
Technical analysts are looking for both contracts to test higher levels soon, while BMI Research said it saw ""significant potential for an upwards break in Brent towards $60 per barrel,"" due to technical drivers even though there were few fundamentals supporting higher prices.
But analysts at PVM note OPEC's record high production in recent months as well as rising global crude inventories.
""The oil market has been getting stronger on hopes and expectations in the absence of hard facts. Another way to put it is that oil prices are inflated. Whether the bubble will burst or grow even bigger depends on the end-November meeting."" 

OPEC's November meeting may agree on a half a million to 1 million barrels per day oil production cut. The producer cartel hopes non-OPEC exporters, especially Russia, will cooperate.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose by around 1 percent on Wednesday, lifted by a report of a drop in U.S. crude inventories and declining production in China, while an upbeat OPEC statement on its planned output cut also supported the market.
A slightly weaker dollar boosted oil as well, traders said, as it makes fuel purchases cheaper for countries using other currencies, potentially spurring demand. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were trading at $50.85 per barrel at 0654 GMT, up 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, from their last settlement.
International Brent crude futures were at $52.23 a barrel, up 55 cents, or 1 percent. 
""The American Petroleum Institute crude inventory numbers were released ... this has given early Asian trading a bullish start,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA in Singapore.
U.S. crude stockpiles fell 3.8 million barrels in the week to Oct. 14, to 467.1 million barrels, the API reported late on Tuesday. 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due to release official crude and fuel storage data later on Wednesday. 
Traders said oil was supported by Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), saying he is confident about the prospects of a planned production cut following an OPEC meeting on Nov. 30.
""I am optimistic we will have a decision,"" he said.
In its first output cut agreement since 2008, OPEC said it plans to reduce production to 32.50 million to 33.0 million barrels per day (bpd), compared with record output of 33.6 million bpd in September.
The group also hopes non-OPEC producers, especially Russia, will cooperate in a cut.
In China, a raft of economic and trade data was released on Wednesday.
While economic growth was in line with expectations, at an annual growth rate of 6.7 percent in the third quarter, its oil figures were supportive of higher oil prices, traders said.
China processed 43.8 million tonnes (10.7 million bpd) of crude oil in September, up 2.4 percent from a year ago, government data showed.
At the same time, China's crude output fell 9.8 percent to 3.89 million bpd, to near its lowest in six years in the second-biggest year-on-year decline on record. 

The sharp decline followed a record 9.9 percent drop in August and is the latest sign that a prolonged efficiency drive by drillers in one of the world's top five producers may help to rebalance the oversupplied global market, traders said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. independent refiners such as PBF Energy (N:PBF) and Phillips 66 (N:PSX) are expected to report another quarter of disappointing profits in coming weeks, as hopes that a record summer driving season would turn the industry's fortunes around do not appear to have materialized.
U.S. refiners are in the midst of their worst year since the shale boom began in 2011. High fuel inventories have punished margins this year, forcing some refiners to voluntarily cut production, delay capital work, lay off workers and slash employee benefits.
With margins expected to remain under pressure, relief is not coming anytime soon, analysts say. Overall supply levels are still elevated, and the cost to meet U.S. renewable fuel standards will drag on profits for the remainder of the year.
Earnings expectations have been falling over the last month for an index of nine independent refiners that are part of the S&P 500. Over the last 30 days, the forecast for the third quarter has dropped by 3.8 percent on average, according to StarMine, a unit of Thomson Reuters. 
""2016 is probably a lost year for the U.S. refining industry,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Paul Cheng said.
The benchmark U.S. crack spread  Motorists hit U.S. roads in record numbers over the summer, but the demand was not enough to deplete the massive buildup in gasoline inventories that existed heading into the summer driving season. Those inventories - the result of overproduction last winter - hurt margins. Heading into the winter, distillate stocks are at their highest seasonally since 2010. Refiners built up distillate stocks over the summer as they pushed their plants to pump out gasoline.  The U.S. refining industry has widely blamed its economic misfortunes on the country's renewable fuel program, which forces refiners to either blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel pool or buy renewable fuel credits. The fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers, or RINs, have jumped in price this year. Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) opened the earnings season last week, reporting a $45 million loss at its Monroe Energy refinery for the third quarter, versus a $106 million profit a year ago. The company is expecting the refinery to lose more than $100 million this year, versus more than $300 million in profits last year. Delta, which does not have a blending operation and must buy credits for the fuel it produces, said it spent $48 million in the third quarter on RINs, nearly triple what it paid last year.  Another local refinery, Philadelphia Energy Solutions, blamed the rising cost of RINs for its decision to lay off up to 100 non-union employees and slash benefits. [nL1N1CG0U7] In May, Marathon Petroleum (N:MPC) laid off 46 employees at its Galveston Bay refinery in Texas. [nL2N18L1V4] Standalone refineries like PES and Monroe will continue to struggle in the Northeast because they have little advantage over international rivals and face tougher environmental obligations at home, Sandy Fielden, director of research, commodities and energy at Morningstar in Austin, Texas, said in a report due Wednesday.  ""U.S. refiner margins as a whole are lower in 2016 versus 2015 and Q4 is not likely to be different with higher crude prices and soft product prices due to higher inventories,"" he said. 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects this winter to be about 18 percent colder than last year's historically mild season.

Monthly export figures are provided by Riyadh and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to the Joint Organizations Data Initiative (JODI), which published them on its website on Tuesday.
After the kingdom pumped a record high 10.673 million bpd in July due to summer demand and requests from customers, its August output dropped to 10.630 million bpd.
Crude oil used to generate power rose 42,000 barrels per day in August to 739,000 barrels per day.
Saudi Arabia's oil inventories peaked last October at a record high 329.430 million barrels but have declined to meet domestic demand without affecting exports.
Its domestic crude inventories totaled 281.01 million barrels, down from 281.463 million barrels in July, data provided by JODI showed.
Domestic refineries processed 2.600 million bpd of crude in August, down from 2.611 million in July. Exports of refined oil products in August inched higher to 1.370 million bpd from 1.367 million bpd in July.
State oil firm Saudi Aramco has stakes in more than 5 million bpd of refining capacity at home and abroad, placing it among the global leaders in making oil products.
Notably, OPEC agreed on September 28 to  reduce output at its November policy meeting to a range of 32.50 million barrels per day to 33.0 million bpd — the cartel's first output cut since the 2008 financial crisis.
Since then, oil prices have ticked up significantly, climbing above $50 a barrel in  early October for the first time since June 2016. In fact, WTI Crude is up by about 15% since mid-September, while Brent crude oil is up by about 13%.
However, in the immediate aftermath, some analysts noted that the deal might be more rhetoric and less action.
Diving into the actual numbers, a Citi Research team led by Edward L. Morse  noted at the time that ""Saudi Arabia might be reducing crude output by as much as 0.5 million barrels per day going into 4Q'16 in any case, as internal crude oil demand for power generation goes down seasonally after the summer peak; much of this cut is what would have happened regardless of any deal.""
Plus, there are various other factors that could all influence what happens in come OPEC's formal November meeting in November. As Marc Chandler, the global head of currency strategy,  noted on Monday:
""More importantly, the fundamental story is becoming more nuanced. First, there is a growing dispute within OPEC about the current level of output. [...] Second, Russia may not be a reliable partner for OPEC. [...] Third, US producers are increasing their drilling operations."""

345,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2016 05:40AM ET</span>",A Texas unicorn preps for a rare oil IPO,"By Mike Stone
(Reuters) - Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC is a unicorn roaming the barren landscape of West Texas.
Founded by a retired NFL player and his high school buddy - with land deals signed on the hood of a pickup - the Fort Worth oil and gas company is now worth nearly $3 billion, according to a half dozen bankers who have examined its value.
That's triple the $1 billion threshold for a so-called unicorn, the moniker most often used in Silicon Valley for high-value private companies. An IPO would be a crowning achievement for John Sellers and Cody Campbell, who co-founded predecessor companies starting in early 2009.
The valuation is based on prices paid for mineral rights in the Permian Basin, where the duo has leased more than 65,000 net acres of oil-rich land in the past two years. Demand has soared here because of new drilling techniques that can extract crude at a profit despite low oil prices.
The success of any Double Eagle IPO would depend on whether the oil price recovery holds, but that uncertainty doesn't bother the Texans - so far, they have made a fortune off the price crash.
""Had it not been for the turndown,"" Sellers said, ""we would never have seen as many opportunities to put together so much acreage.""
Until now, most energy companies have been bought out before going public, but the successful IPO this month of Extraction Oil & Gas (O:XOG) - the first stock market debut of a U.S. oil and gas explorer in more than two years - could pave the way for more.
The Double Eagle business model is not new. Dale Operating, a private company in Dallas, has leased and sold 17 portfolios of assets since 1982. It is a high-risk endeavor because leases can run out before drilling succeeds.
""It's possible to be directionally right, but lose if it does not happen in time,"" said Larry Dale, the president of Dale Operating.
Now, Double Eagle is ramping up the risk by becoming a drilling company, competing against established Permian Basin players such as RSP Permian Inc (N:RSPP) and Callon Petroleum Co (N:CPE).
BUGS CRAWLING THE WALLS
Sellers and Campbell got into the oil business after the 2008 U.S. housing crash ended their separate careers as real estate developers. Sellers had gone into real estate after college, and Campbell had done so in 2006 after a pectoral muscle tear cut short his 17-month career as an offensive lineman with the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League.
Nearly broke, Sellers and Campbell relied on bank loans and help from friends and family to get started.
Unlike larger competitors, who outsource the search for lease rights to local agents, the two men searched land registers themselves for mineral deeds, then followed up personally with the landowners, usually small farmers in Texas and Louisiana.
They often sealed deals for lease options on 200 or 500 acres at a time with handshakes outside the local grain elevator. The goal was to sell groups of leases to drillers such as Chesapeake Energy Corp (N:CHK) or  Devon Energy  Corp (N:DVN).
In the early days, they worked out of an old Texaco field office in rural Texas. Bugs crawled the walls. The two men, still in their twenties, shot cans out back for fun.
“Every deal was critical,"" Sellers said in an interview at Double Eagle’s more upmarket current headquarters in Fort Worth. ""If they didn’t sell, we were done.”
CASHING IN
During a particularly cash-strapped moment, they bought one landowner a round-trip, first-class ticket to London - spending $9,800 on a credit card with a $10,000 limit - as a form of payment to extend their lease option on his land. The lease on that land was eventually sold, to Endeavor Energy Resources LP, one day in January 2009 - an hour before the option expired - in a hotel lobby in Tyler, Texas.
The landowner wept when he got a check for $5.5 million for his mineral rights. Sellers and Campbell made enough to pay off their debts and went on to secure more than ten thousand leases covering more than a million acres, selling them off in bundles.
By 2012, with the price of oil at about $100 per barrel, Double Eagle's success caught the ear of Wall Street. Greg Beard, Head of Natural Resources at private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC, recalled thinking after he first met them in Ft. Worth: ""We have to work with these guys.""
Apollo invested, and less than two years later, in November 2014, Sellers and Campbell sold one of their many business entities, Double Eagle Energy Oklahoma LLC, for $251 million to Aubrey McClendon's American Energy Partners L.P. Apollo reaped a four-fold return from its early investment on acreage in the Oklahoma formation known as the SCOOP, which is now crowded with drillers.
The sale couldn't have come at a better time. The price of oil had already peaked and was heading toward a 12-year low of about $28 per barrel.
Apollo's investment in Double Eagle represents a new tack by private equity firms - backing modern wildcatters to gradually build portfolios of mineral rights.
The move comes after some spectacular failures in traditional leveraged buyouts of energy companies. KKR & Co LP’s (N:KKR) $7.2 billion acquisition of Samson Resources Corp, for instance, ended in bankruptcy last year when shale drilling became more expensive than the debt-laden company could handle. Apollo’s EP Energy Corp (N:EPE), also purchased in a leveraged buyout, has lost four-fifths of its stock value in the oil market rout since the exploration and production company went public in January 2014 at a valuation of more than $5 billion.
BASIN ECONOMICS
Sellers and Campbell sensed opportunity as the price headed south. They focused on the Midland Basin, a rocky area of the Permian basin where technological advances had made it profitable to drill even with prices at $35 a barrel.
They deployed the same model – searching land registers and dealing with landowners directly – but this time with a staff of more than 50. Deals still get done on the hoods of trucks.
Apollo has again teamed up with them and, together with Campbell and Sellers, have invested more than $500 million.
Starting next month, Double Eagle will drill on their leased land instead of flipping the mineral rights. It has hired a well-completion expert to prepare for drilling, and in August brought on a chief financial officer with public company experience to prep for an IPO. In October, the company merged with Veritas Energy - increasing its leased acreage by about a third - and created Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC.
The timing again looks fortuitous, with oil prices up more than 10 percent this month on prospects that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major producers will agree a sizeable output cut or freeze.
Sellers and Campbell are counting on their West Texas location to help them hedge against the additional risks of drilling.

“Even if the rest of the industry crumbles, that basin is going to stand on its own,"" Campbell said. ""It has the best economics of any North American basin.”

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) was up 40 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $50.34 a barrel.
Traders said prices were receiving support from the notion that oil markets, which have been dogged by oversupply for two years, may be closer to balance than previously anticipated.
Beyond estimating production and consumption, one way to gauge the supply and demand balance is to analyze fuel inventory changes.
""Global oil inventories (industry and government) increased by 17 million barrels to 5.618 billion barrels in 3Q16. This is the smallest build since 4Q14, confirming that inventory builds are slowing as the market comes back into balance,"" Bernstein Energy said in a note on Tuesday.
Bernstein said that recent inventory declines ""suggest that oil markets may be closer to re-balancing than some expect,"" but added that going forward ""much depends on how much OPEC is prepared to cut at the upcoming meetings in Vienna at the end of November"".
Citi bank said in a note that ""the much cited oil market oversupply has, for the last 4 weeks, at least, been notably belied by the data,"" pointing to an overall drop in inventories from United States, Japan, Singapore and Europe of 35.9 million barrels.
Traders are taking note, with money managers raising their bullish bets on U.S. crude prices to the highest level since the slump started in 2014.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will meet on Nov. 30 to discuss a planned output cut of around 1 million barrels per day away from its record 33.6 million bpd production in September .
The cartel hopes that major non-OPEC producer Russia will cooperate.
Despite the potential cuts, traders said oil was pressured by concerns over a slowdown in demand, especially in Asia, the main pillar of demand growth in recent years.

In China, the trade environment will remain weak for the remainder of 2016, the commerce ministry said on Tuesday. And, in India, fuel demand fell 0.7 percent in September compared with the same month last year, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the oil ministry showed.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled down on Monday, weighed by oversupply concerns, with a spike in trade volume driving U.S prices below $50, but losses were limited amid a projected drop in American shale output. 
Trades in U.S. crude futures contracts soared to 12,932 barrels during the minute of 9:35 a.m. EDT (1335 GMT), the highest since Oct. 13, as traders sold off contracts ahead of their Oct. 20 expiry date.
Prices rose slightly in the afternoon, as U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed shale oil production was expected to fall by 30,000 barrels per day (bdp) in November.
International benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) fell 43 cents, or 0.8 percent, from the last settlement to close at $51.52 per barrel, after hitting a session low of $51.16 a barrel.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) closed at $49.94 per barrel, down 41 cents, or 0.8 percent, after hitting a session low of $49.47.
Analysts said traders had accumulated a high number of long positions, and were looking to sell ahead of their contracts' expiry date as the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission limits the number they can hold. 
""There was a huge net speculative long position,"" said Kyle Cooper, analyst at ION Energy in Houston. ""You do have to get out of positions.""
Data from energy monitoring service Genscape showed a draw in crude stockpiles at the storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma. 
But traders said WTI was still under pressure from a report on Friday by oil services provider Baker Hughes, which showed U.S. drillers added four rigs in the week to Oct. 14. [RIG/U] 
Donald Morton, who runs an energy-trading desk at Herbert J. Sims & Co in Fairfield, Connecticut, said the projected decline in U.S. shale production bumped the market only slightly. 
""It wasn't a game changer for the day,"" he said. ""We rallied 25 cents a barrel, only to give it back for the most part.""
Analysts said that while the market was supported by expectations that members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would take action to support prices late next month, oversupply continued to weigh. 
OPEC agreed in September to cut supply to between 32.5 million and 33.0 million bpd, and expects to finalize the details of the deal at its meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30.
OPEC pumped a record 33.6 million bpd of crude oil in September, with some members signaling they plan further increases.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The $12.9 billion sale of India's Essar Oil to a group led by Russia's Rosneft (MM:ROSN) does not run foul of U.S. sanctions imposed against the majority state-owned Russian energy firm, parent Essar Group's CEO said on Sunday.
The sale, which was signed on Saturday. It is the biggest foreign acquisition ever in India and Russia's largest outbound deal.
The deal that will give Rosneft (MM:ROSN), commodities trading house Trafigura and private investment group United Capital Partners a 98 percent stake in Essar's oil arm is ""US-sanctions compliant,"" said Essar Group's chief executive, Prashant Ruia.
He said the deal did not violate the economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. government on Russian entities over Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis. ""The way it is structured, it is fully compliant. We are well within the rules that govern Russian companies.""
Essar, controlled by the billionaire Ruia brothers, has interests in oil and gas, steel, ports and power, and has been under pressure from its lenders to reduce debts.
""It was an emotional decision, it was a very tough decision. It was difficult decision for people involved in the company and those who were involved in the business and building it,"" said Ruia in an interview with Reuters on Sunday.
""We felt all in all, we were getting attractive valuations and we decided to sell.""
DEBT REDUCTION
Essar plans to use proceeds from the sale to offset some 50 percent of the debt on its group companies after the deal is completed.
Ruia said the parent company's debt would be cut by some $5 billion and a further $5 billion would go toward trimming debt at the operating company level.
Some of the proceeds from the transaction will be pumped into existing businesses, said Ruia, adding that the group does not have any plans to sell any of its other businesses in the future or any plans to de-list them to gain more control. 
Debt-laden Essar Steel, which owns a 10 million tonne steel plant in the western state Gujarat, carries debt of over $5 billion and had been seeking to restructure its debt.

Ruia said Essar is working closely with the banks to work out a restructuring plan and some of the funds raised via the sale of Essar Oil would go into restructuring the operations of Essar Steel.

361,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2016 09:41AM ET</span>",Benefits of greenhouse gas pact may fall short of high hopes,"By Alister Doyle
OSLO (Reuters) - A pact by almost 200 nations to slash greenhouse gases used in refrigerators and air conditioners will likely fall short of governments' hopes of averting a full half-degree Celsius (0.9 Fahrenheit) of warming this century, scientists say.
Saturday's agreement in Kigali, Rwanda, is the biggest single step to limit climate change since governments reached a global agreement in Paris last year to shift the world economy from fossil fuels this century.
Amid celebrations of the legally binding Kigali pact to phase down use of factory-made hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), many governments and environmentalists said it could avert 0.5C of warming this century, citing a 2013 scientific study.
But some leading researchers expect it will be less. 
Eager to declare a victory, governments glossed over many uncertainties about HFCs. Some more recent research indicates HFCs may be less powerful in trapping heat than once feared, said Michiel Schaeffer of Climate Analytics.
""My guesstimate would be around 0.2 degree Celsius (0.36F) by 2100"" of avoided warming, he said. Climate Analytics is one of four European research groups working together to project temperatures based on government pledges.
Their Climate Action Tracker indicates that government promises for cutting greenhouse gases - if all carried out and before accounting for the HFC agreement - would raise average temperatures by 2.7C (4.9F) over pre-industrial times by 2100.
Half a degree would be a gigantic saving.
Last year's Paris Agreement set an over-riding goal of limiting a rise in average temperatures to ""well below"" 2C (3.6F), ideally just 1.5C (2.7F), to avert more droughts, floods, rising sea levels and food and water shortages.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, whose government hopes to leave a strong legacy in fighting global warming, hailed the Kigali agreement as a ""monumental"" step forward. 
""It will give us the opportunity to reduce the warming of the planet by an entire half a degree centigrade,"" he said. 
Guus Velders, an author of the widely quoted 2013 study of HFCs and warming, said his calculations of the impact of the Kigali accord show HFCs are now likely to stoke only 0.06C (0.1F) of warming this century, down from a range of 0.3C to 0.5C with no action. 
He said it was better to give ranges because of many uncertainties. Using one number means ""it seems you know more than you do,"" said Velders, who works at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment.
The Rwanda pact sets varying dates for rich and poor nations to freeze and cut HFC use. 
The United States and the European Union are among those that already have laws phasing out HFCs, with manufacturers using less damaging chemicals in fridges and air conditioners and aerosols. 
Andrew Jones of Climate Interactive, a U.S. based think-tank that builds climate simulations with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the HFC deal was crucial to combat global warming.

""But it's in no way a silver bullet,"" he said, adding that his group would not lop as much as 0.5 degree off its existing projection that the Paris promises will lead to 3.5C of warming this century.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2016 07:20AM ET</span>",Oil majors experiment with technology to weather crisis,"By Karolin Schaps and Jessica Jaganathan
LONDON/OSLO (Reuters) - Oil majors including  Statoil , Shell and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) are experimenting with various technologies, from drones and drill design to data management, to drive down costs and weather a deep downturn. 
Crude prices have more than halved since mid-2014, forcing companies to cut billions of dollars in costs. Determined to shield dividends and preserve the infrastructure that will allow them to compete and grow if the market recovers, they are increasingly looking to smarter tech and design to make savings. 
French oil and gas major  Total  (PA:TOTF) said it was now using drones to carry out detailed inspections on some of its oil fields following a trial at one of its Elgin/Franklin platforms in the North Sea. 
Cyberhawk, the drone company that led the trial, said this kind of work was previously carried out by engineers who suspended themselves from ropes at dizzying heights. It said the manned inspection used to take seven separate two-week trips with a 12-man team that had to be flown in and accommodated on site.
The drones do the work in two days and at about a tenth of the cost, according to the Britain-based firm's founder Malcolm Connolly, who said it had also worked with ExxonMobil (N:XOM), Shell (L:RDSa), ConocoPhillips (N:COP) and  BP  (L:BP). 
Total declined to comment on how long the manned or drone inspections took, or specify how much money was saved.
Statoil's (OL:STL) giant Johan Sverdrup field, the largest North Sea oil find in three decades which is due to start production in 2019, is a leading industry case study for cutting costs in the era of cheap oil.
The Norwegian company has cut its development costs for the first stage of the project by a fifth compared with estimates given in early 2015, to 99 billion crowns ($12.2 billion). 
The savings have largely been made by focusing on the most efficient technology and designs from the beginning, Statoil's head of technology Margareth Oevrum told Reuters in an interview. 
Executives say the growing attention on technologies that have been around for some time shows how wasteful the global industry had been in the years before the downturn when - with crude at above $100 a barrel delivering bumper profits - oil companies' had little incentive to develop fields efficiently.
For example, simply finding a more efficient route for the oil pipeline that would carry the crude from the Sverdrup field to the onshore refinery cut 1 billion crowns, Statoil said.
ROBOTS, FOAM
Statoil has also developed a drilling ""template"" that is acting as a guide for the first eight wells to be drilled at the field. It said it had reduced the overall drilling time by more than 50 days, saving about 150 million crowns per production well compared with what it would have cost with 2013 techniques.
""By far the biggest driver (of savings) has been simplification,"" said Oevrum. ""To think much simpler and start from the bottom, or the bare bone, and then rather add to that, instead of starting very big.""
The company could not give a figure for its group savings made from improved technology and design. But it said that, partly because of such innovations, projects set to start production by 2022 would be able to make a profit with an oil price at $41 a barrel, down from $70 in 2013. 
Global upstream - exploration and production - oil and gas spending has fallen by more than $300 billion across the industry in 2015-16, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), roughly equivalent to the annual GDP of South Africa. Around two-thirds comes from cost cuts, rather than cancelling or shelving projects, it said. 
Shell, for example, has developed a new type of pipe, called a steel lazy wave riser, to carry oil and gas from its deepwater Stones field in the Gulf of Mexico for processing. It bends to absorb the motion of the sea and the floating platform, which the company says boosts production at extreme depths. 
The Anglo-Dutch major could not say how much the pipes contributed to increased efficiency, but said innovations at Stones had played a significant part in cost savings of $1.8 billion in its projects and technology division last year - equivalent to the 2015 core profits in its upstream division.
The fall in oil prices has led to the introduction of other new engineering and maintenance techniques. 
Chevron is using a robotic device to clean and check the inside of pipelines on their Erskine field in the North Sea more quickly. The improvement has helped raise the field's daily production rate to the highest in two years. 
Oil services firm  Amec  Foster Wheeler (L:AMFW), working for BG Group which is now part of Shell, has applied a new technique to remove the pillars of an old platform, a procedure that is often dangerous because corroded elements can slip off. 
It pumped in expanding foam to hold the pillar's elements together, allowing workers to safely cut the metal away. This work took just over seven weeks instead of the 22 weeks typically needed using traditional methods.
Alex Brooks, oil and gas equity analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said tech innovation in the industry was about ""100 tiny things"", adding: ""The bottom line is you end up with a much lower cost.""
The downturn has presented opportunities for some services firms that can offer cost-saving innovations. Inspection drone firm Cyberhawk, for instance, said its revenue from oil and gas had doubled from mid-2014 to mid-2016, while the wider inspection market had shrunk. 
VAST DATA
Another way oil companies are looking to cut costs is by using their vast amounts of data to better predict their needs.
Since the price slump, companies including Shell, ExxonMobil and Statoil have started using software that can better manage their data to cut wastage in the ordering of construction materials. 
Stuck with excess material, some companies suffered huge losses because the resale value was much lower and in some cases they even took to burying unwanted material, according to Intergraph, a unit of Swedish tech firm  Hexagon  (ST:HEXAb) that develops such systems for oil industry clients.
""Previously, it was industry standard to order 3-5 percent more materials than needed, which in a billion-dollar project is a lot of money,"" said Patrick Holcomb, executive vice president at Intergraph. 
Better managing data has helped oil firms understand exactly how much material is needed and when it will be delivered, cutting excess to one or two tenths of a percent, he added. 
Gunnar Presthus, Nordic energy lead at consultancy Accenture, who advises oil majors and national oil companies, said the downturn had led to the industry waking up to the potential of the data they store. 
""The oil industry, to some extent, is one of the most digitalized industries,"" he said. ""Companies are now able to use this wealth of data to make changes that will save money.""

Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $6.00, or 0.48%, to settle at $1,251.6 a troy ounce.
The dollar rebounded to almost seven-month highs as solid data on U.S. retail sales and producer prices bolstered expectations for a rate hike by the Fed in the coming months.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.56% to 98.08 late Friday and ended the week up 1.4%.
The upbeat economic reports came after Wednesday’s minutes of the Fed’s September meeting showed several officials believed it would be appropriate to raise interest rates ""relatively soon"" if the economy continued to improve.
The U.S. central bank raised rates for the first time in almost a decade in December, but rates have remained on hold since then amid concerns over sluggish inflation.
The Fed’s next meeting is in November, but a rate hike ahead of the presidential election is seen as unlikely.
Investors currently price a 64% chance of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting; according to federal funds futures tracked Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for December delivery were at $17.42 a troy ounce in late trade.
Elsewhere in metals trading, copper for December delivery settled at $2.105 a pound.

364,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 16, 2016 04:50AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Futures - Weekly Outlook: October 17 - 21,"Investing.com - Oil futures slipped on Friday, but still scored their fourth weekly gain in a row as market players awaited details of a planned output cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for December delivery slipped 8 cents, or 0.15%, on Friday to settle at $51.95 a barrel by close of trade. For the week, it scored a gain of 2 cents, or 0.04%, after posting advances in each of the last three weeks.
London-traded Brent prices rose to a one-year high of $53.73 on Monday after Russia said it was prepared to join an oil-output deal with major global oil producers to support the market.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached an agreement to limit production to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held on the sidelines of an energy conference in Algeria late last month.
However, market analysts remained skeptical of the deal, pondering how such a plan would be implemented.
The 14-member oil group said it won’t finalize details or complete its production agreement until the group’s next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.
Brent gave back some gains after OPEC's monthly report published Wednesday revealed that its oil production rose in September to the highest level in eight years. The producer cartel pumped 33.39 million barrels per day last month, up 220,000 barrels per day from August.
Elsewhere, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in November slumped 9 cents, or 0.18%, to end the week at $50.35 a barrel.
Despite Friday's modest losses, New York-traded oil futures rose 54 cents, or 1.07%, on the week, their fourth weekly gain in a row. The U.S. benchmark touched a four-month peak of $51.60 on October 10.
Market players continued to focus on U.S. drilling prospects, amid indications of an ongoing recovery in drilling activity. Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week rose by 4 to 432, marking the 15th increase in 16 weeks.
Some analysts have warned that the recent rally in prices could be self-defeating, as it encourages U.S. shale producers to drill more, underlining concerns over a global supply glut.
Weekly government data showing sizable drawdowns in domestic gasoline and distillate stockpiles, which include heating oil, provided support, although inventories of crude oil rose for the first time in six weeks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
In the week ahead, oil traders will focus on U.S. stockpile data on Tuesday and Wednesday for fresh supply-and-demand signals.
Market players will also continue to monitor supply disruptions across the world for further indications on the rebalancing of the market.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.

""It was sabotage by vandals,"" military spokesman Thomas Otuji said, when asked about a claim by a militant group called Niger Delta Greenland Justice Mandate of an attack of the NNPC pipeline near Iwhremaro on Thursday night.
The group, which has claimed previous attacks, said in a statement it had carried out the attack at about 9pm on Thursday and warned
""Now you shall know what uprooting of your cherished assets means,"" it said to the government and major oil companies that work in joint ventures with NNPC. ""More to come in the coming days.""
There was no immediate information on the impact on Nigeria's oil production. The attacks have reduced output by 700,000 barrels per day, around a third of its production, since the start of the year.
Militants say they want a greater share of Nigeria's oil wealth to go to the impoverished Delta region. Crude sales make up about 70 percent of national income and the vast majority of that oil comes from the southern swampland.
Nigeria, an OPEC member, was Africa's top oil producer until the recent spate of attacks pushed it behind Angola.
President Muhammadu Buhari has said the government is trying to negotiate a lasting solution with the militants but there has been no visible progress. The militant scene is splintered into small groups, made up of mostly of unemployed men, which even their leaders struggle to control.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil slipped below $52 a barrel on Friday, giving up an earlier gain, as abundant crude supplies outweighed tighter U.S. fuel inventories and OPEC's plans to cut output.
Brent crude reached a 2016 high near $54 on Monday, underpinned by OPEC's Sept. 28 deal to reduce oil production, before weakening on rising U.S. crude stocks and as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' own numbers showed output is still rising. [OPEC/M]
Global benchmark Brent (LCOc1) was down 4 cents at $51.99 at 1328 GMT (0928 EDT), having traded as high as $52.55 earlier. U.S. crude (CLc1) gained 20 cents to $50.64.
""The fundamental backdrop is still bearish,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Carsten Fritsch. ""Every increase is driven by speculation and optimism"", rather than an actual tightening of supplies, he said.
U.S. crude inventories overall  rose by 4.9 million barrels, the first increase in six weeks, the government's Energy Information Administration reported on Thursday.
But stocks at the Cushing delivery hub for U.S. crude futures declined and U.S. inventories of distillates, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 3.7 million barrels. Gasoline stocks dropped by 1.9 million barrels. [EIA/S]
U.S. crude's structure gained support from the extended outage of a pipeline capable of delivering 450,000 barrels per day of crude into Cushing, traders said. 
OPEC's plan is to cut its supply to between 32.5 million barrels per day (bpd) and 33 million bpd to help to balance supply and demand and revive prices that remain less than half of the levels reached in mid-2014.
However, a lack of much detail in the initial agreement, such as how much each of the 14 members can pump and the scale of any contributions from non-OPEC countries such as Russia, has left analysts skeptical.
""We are doubtful that OPEC's efforts, even if successful in achieving a targeted 32.5 million bpd in collective output, will prove sufficient to materially alter the global oil balance and deliver a substantial reduction in oil inventories,""  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) said in a report.

OPEC's own monthly report on Wednesday put production at 33.39 million bpd in September.

Crude oil for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.36% to $50.62 a barrel.
Last week, oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week rose by 3 to 428, marking the 14th increase in 15 weeks.
Overnight, in a knee-jerk reaction, West Texas Intermediate oil futures extended losses, falling below the $50 level, in North American trade on Thursday, after data showed that oil supplies in the U.S. registered a massive build.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 4.900 million barrels in the week ended October 7. Market analysts' expected a crude-stock increase of 0.65 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Wednesday reported a supply build of 2.7 million barrels.
The reports came out one day later than usual due to Monday's Columbus Day holiday. Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for NYMEX crude, fell by 1.318 million barrels last week, the EIA said. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 474.0 million barrels as of last week, according to press release which, as of this week, no longer includes crude oil lease stocks. The EIA commented that stockpiles were at “historically high levels for this time of year”.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled up on Thursday after a U.S. government report showing hefty draws in diesel and gasoline offset the first crude inventory build in six weeks.
Crude prices fell initially when the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said crude stocks swelled 4.9 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 7. It was the first crude build since the end of August and was far above a 700,000-barrel rise forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. [EIA/S]
Prices bounced back as the market turned its attention to product inventory drawdowns in the same EIA data. The EIA reported a drop of 3.7 million barrels for distillates, which include diesel and heating oil, and 1.9 million barrels decline for gasoline.
Analysts had expected distillates to draw by just 1.6 million barrels and gasoline to decline by 1.5 million.
Brent crude (LCOc1) settled up 22 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $52.03 per barrel.
U.S. crude (CLc1) ended up 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $50.44.
""There is a lot of seasonality in this data,"" Scott Shelton, energy futures broker at ICAP (LON:IAP) in Durham, North Carolina, said, referring to the EIA inventory report.
Shelton said crude builds were common this time of year as U.S. refineries headed into maintenance.
The rise in crude imports by 110,000 barrels per day (bpd) last week was also ""marginal"" and ""hard to get too excited about if you were bearish"", he argued.
John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, said that while more crude builds were likely in the coming weeks due to depressed refinery runs, ""the declines in distillate fuels, of late, are starting to add up"".
""We remain a long way from supplies getting tight, but it is a trend worth monitoring,"" Kilduff added.
In a separate report, the EIA said U.S. crude output averaged 8.7 million bpd in 2016 versus 9.4 million bpd last year. But it also said oil demand growth was expected to slow to 70,000 bpd this year from a previously forecast 200,000 bpd.
Oil prices have trended higher since Sept. 27, with Brent gaining about 13 percent, after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced its first planned output cut in eight years to rein in a global supply glut that forced crude to crash from highs above $100.
Despite its expressed desire to cut output, OPEC this week reported September production at eight-year highs.

Oil industry executives and investors at a Reuters Summit differed on how OPEC action will likely affect oil prices, with some expecting $60 by year-end and others seeing a return to $40.

BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China imported record volumes of crude oil last month, eclipsing the United States as the world's top buyer of foreign oil as Beijing's state reserves shipped in cheap crude to fill new storage tanks.
September's crude imports rose 18 percent from a year earlier to 33.06 million tonnes or 8.04 million barrels per day (bpd) on daily basis, customs data showed. 
The buying outpaced the U.S. four-week average assessed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration of 7.98 million bpd at the end of September.
It marked the second time this year - but the third month in the past twelve - that China's imports have overtaken the United States, and reflected contracts signed in July when renewed selling pressure pushed crude below $42 a barrel. Oil has since recovered to around $50 a barrel.
The shipments also arrived as Chinese refineries entered the final stretch of their annual maintenance season, which typically takes place in the third quarter.
With U.S. plants' repair work extending into this month, the world's largest economy could retake pole position in October, analysts said.
China's strategic reserve is preparing to start filling late this year newly-built storage tanks that can take some 19 million barrels of crude, or about three days worth of imports, traders said. 
""The increase was mainly driven by stocking activities at some reserve sites,"" said Harry Liu, associate director of oil markets with IHS Energy, who said August and September volumes were higher than he expected.
That contrasts with earlier in the year when China's independent refiners known as ""teapots"" were the driving force behind the imports.
Analysts from BMI research expected China's crude imports to remain elevated for the rest of the year due to falling production, expanding storage capacity and a seasonal uptick in demand over the winter months.
Over the first nine months, import volumes rose 14 percent to 284 million tonnes, or 7.55 million bpd, according to the data. On a cumulative basis, the United States is still the biggest importer with more than 8 million bpd of imports. 
China's refined fuel exports in September rose 21.1 percent from a year ago to 4.3 million tonnes, near the record high 4.57 million tonnes notched in July and well up on August's 3.7 million tonnes.

The month-on-month gain rekindled worries of a supply glut in fuel products and might weigh on oil demand in the fourth quarter, analysts said.

390,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2016 02:22PM ET</span>",Bolt cutters expose vulnerability of North America's oil pipeline grid,"By Liz Hampton and Ethan Lou
HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - All it took was a pair of bolt cutters and the elbow grease of a few climate activists to carry out an audacious act of sabotage on North America's massive oil and gas pipeline system.
For an industry increasingly reliant on gadgets such as digital sensors, infrared cameras and drones to monitor security and check for leaks, the sabotage illustrated how vulnerable pipelines are to low-tech attacks.
On Tuesday, climate activists broke through fences and cut locks and chains simultaneously in several states and simply turned the pipelines off. 
All they had to do was twist shut giant valves on five cross-border pipelines that together can send 2.8 million barrels a day of crude to the United States from Canada - equal to about 15 percent of daily U.S. consumption.
The activists did no damage to the pipelines, which operating companies shut down as a precaution for checks before restarting.
The United States is the world's largest energy market, and the infrastructure to drill, refine, store and deliver that energy to consumers is connected by millions of miles of pipeline that are impossible to protect entirely from attack.
""You're not manning these things on a permanent basis. It's not viable,"" said Stewart Dewar, a project manager at Senstar, an Ottawa-based company that authored a 2012 white paper on pipeline security. ""It's too expensive."" 
There are more than 200,000 miles (322,000 km) of oil lines and many times that of natural gas lines across the United States. Thousands of rural and often remote pumping and valve stations dot the country.
The cost of posting armed guards at valve stations, usually found every 20 miles along the underground pipelines, would be prohibitive, said Dewar.
For companies, there are few options to police the parts of their pipeline networks that sit above ground, such as the valve stations.
The stations are usually protected by nothing more than the same flimsy chain link fence and padlocks elementary schools use to protect their playgrounds.
GLOBAL PROBLEM
The same vulnerabilities are present worldwide. In Nigeria and conflict zones such as Iraq, pipelines have been targeted by militants. In Mexico, thieves target the fuel arteries to siphon off fuel.
But until Tuesday, environmental activists had never carried out a simultaneous, coordinated attack of this magnitude.
Tuesday's action, supported by the Vermont-based Climate Disobedience Action Fund, was held to draw attention to climate change and to support opponents of the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline, which critics say could rupture and sour drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota.
Several pipeline operators and safety experts said shutting off valves was extremely dangerous and that activists underestimated the risks.
Pipelines can be heavily pressurized depending on length and altitude variation, and shutting off a valve could cause ruptures that are ""catastrophic"" for the environment, Paul Tullis of Tullis Engineering Consultants said.
""It's like a freight train,"" he said of the momentum with which the oil moves. ""If these people are hydraulic engineers, they might be able to do this safely.""
Activists often do not fully know what they are doing, even if they think they do, Tullis said. 
Protesters said they spent months studying how to safely shut the valves. The ability for them to access the proprietary information necessary to shut a line safely was questioned by experts. 
Either way, pipeline specialists said it was lucky there were no leaks on Tuesday. Once the valves are shut, pressure can quickly build up inside pipelines that operate under as much as 1,000 pounds (450 kg) per square inch. 
Protesters were taking a chance that a weak spot in a line would not explode, and that employees in operations hubs would spring into action after hearing alarms.
""On the wrong pipeline, in the wrong place (actions like this) could kill people. This is hazardous hot liquid. It's not something to be terrified of, but it must be respected,"" said Richard Kuprewicz, president of Accufacts Inc, a pipeline advisory firm. 
SECURITY RAMP-UP AFTER 9/11
After the tampering, owners Enbridge Inc, TransCanada Corp,  Spectra Energy  (NYSE:SE) and  Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI) shut their lines as a precaution.
They did not immediately respond to questions about their broader security precautions, though some of them emphasized having multiple safety systems in place. 
The general vulnerability of U.S. infrastructure - from bridges to power plants and ports - became more apparent after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Since then, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has asked pipeline companies to carry out a “security vulnerability assessment” for their assets and to conduct risk assessments that include the “likelihood of a success of an attack,” and to take steps to mitigate those risks.
A review published by the DHS in 2015 identified physical and cyber security as a risk to energy infrastructure systems, including the threat of multiple, coordinated attacks and electromagnetic pulse events, but focused primarily on threats to the electrical grid.
Security experts said they have tried to strike a balance between protecting facilities, ensuring freedom of movement and keeping costs in check.
The Association of Oil Pipe Lines, an industry group, said it recognized disagreements exist about energy policy, but that the protest went too far.
Previous valve closures have caused spills, including one of nearly 4,000 barrels of oil, the group said.

""We don't want anyone to get hurt or cause a release into the environment,"" said Andrew Black, the group's president.

In a joint statement, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and Canadian Minister of International Trade Chrystia Freeland said negotiators were meeting in Washington this week.
""In those negotiations, we will work to meet the mandate agreed to by President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau when they met in Ottawa in June — a new agreement that is designed to maintain Canadian exports at or below an agreed-upon U.S. market share to be negotiated, with the stability, consistency and flexibility necessary to achieve the confidence of both industries,"" they said in a joint statement.
""The softwood lumber industry is a vital sector for both the United States and Canada,"" they added.
The most recent round of arguments ended with a 2006 deal that expired in October 2015. Both sides agreed to take no action for a year after that, but without a new treaty, U.S. firms have made clear they will file new damage claims.

Major Canadian lumber firms include Canfor Corp, West Fraser Timber Co, Interfor Corp and Resolute Forest Products Inc.

LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC reported a increase in its oil production in September to the highest in at least eight years and raised its forecast for 2017 non-OPEC supply growth, pointing to a larger surplus next year despite the group's deal to cut output.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 33.39 million barrels per day (bpd) last month, according to figures OPEC collects from secondary sources, up 220,000 bpd from August, OPEC said in a monthly report on Wednesday.
The figures underline OPEC's challenge in seeking to restrain supplies for the first time since 2008 to curb a persistent supply glut and prop up prices. Oil is trading near $53 a barrel (LCOc1), less than half the price hit in mid-2014. 
""Inventories stand near all-time highs worldwide,"" OPEC said in the report. ""Although in recent weeks these high levels have been slightly drawn down.""
To speed up a rebalancing of the market, OPEC agreed at a meeting in Algeria on Sept. 28 to cut supply to between 32.50 million bpd and 33.0 million bpd. The group hopes to finalize details, including how much each of the its 14 members can pump, at a meeting in November.
The report showed the supply boost in September mostly came from Libya and Nigeria, which are restoring output after disruptions, and from Iraq, which has questioned the accuracy of OPEC's secondary-source figures.
OPEC uses two sets of figures to monitor its output: figures provided by each country, and secondary sources which include industry media. The reason why two sets of figures are used is because of past disputes over how much countries were really pumping.
Iraq told OPEC it produced 4.775 million bpd in September, while the secondary sources put output at 4.455 million bpd. From Iraq's point of view, joining the OPEC supply cut deal from the higher figure would be more favorable. 
Baghdad has taken issue with the gap between the two sets of figures. Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi called a separate briefing on the day of the Algeria meeting to complain about the gap.
That aside, OPEC's report is the latest to show output is hitting new peaks. The September figure is the highest since at least 2008, according to a Reuters review of past OPEC reports. 
In the report, OPEC also raised its forecast of non-OPEC supply next year, saying output from outside the group would rise by 240,000 bpd, up 40,000 bpd from an earlier forecast due to a higher forecast for Russia.
With demand for OPEC crude in 2017 expected to average 32.59 million bpd, the report indicates there will now be an average surplus of 800,000 bpd if OPEC keeps output steady. Last month's report pointed to a 760,000 bpd surplus.

OPEC made no change to the global oil demand outlook, predicting demand growth of 1.15 million bpd in 2017.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - While OPEC and other big crude producers work toward a deal to cap production to erode a glut, industry executives are concerned the sharp drop in investment that followed the oil price crash could lead to another crisis - a supply shortage.
Over $1 trillion worth of oil projects have been canceled or delayed, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday at the World Energy Congress in Istanbul, after companies slashed budgets due to oil prices more than halving to around $50 a barrel since mid-2014.
Oil fields take years to develop. In many cases, a decision taken in 2016 to develop a field means oil production will start in around 2020.
OPEC, which produces around a third of the world's oil, will hold talks with non-member oil producers on Wednesday to work out details of a global agreement to cap production for at least six months. Non-OPEC member Russia, the world's largest producer, has lent its support.
And as OPEC revives its role as an oil ""central banker"", French oil and gas company Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne urged the industry to start investing again.
""By 2020 we will have a lack of supplies,"" Pouyanne told the conference. 
""Volatility has been huge. The stress on everybody, the balance sheets of companies and countries is huge,"" he added.
 BP  (LON:BP) Chief Executive Bob Dudley echoed his concerns.
""As much as a $1 trillion of big projects have been canceled or deferred around the world and that could catch up with the world,"" Dudley said at the same event.
So far this year, eight new oil and gas projects have been approved, which will add around 1 million of barrels of oil equivalent when they come on stream, Bernstein analysts said. They are expected to take an average of 38 months to come onstream, at a combined cost of around $22.1 billion.
The International Energy Agency forecast in its 2016 medium-term report that oil demand will outstrip supplies starting in 2018.
But Dudley expects supply and demand to be relatively balanced until the end of the decade due to new fields that are coming on line in the coming years and the abundance of U.S. shale oil, which can be extracted within a few months.
As a result, he expects oil prices to remain within a band of $55 to $70 a barrel until the end of the decade, well below the $114 a barrel it hit in mid-2014.
""I do see the price of oil setting itself a band. Shale oil in the US… will attenuate the price a bit.""
But unlike previous supply shortages, new technological breakthroughs that improve field production and reduce downtime will lead to shorter cycles, said Lorenzo Simonelli, CEO of oil services company GE Oil & Gas.
""The industry will continue to be volatile. However, it has also changed with the advent of shale and technology we are going to see smaller cycles of volatility,"" Simonelli said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Wednesday, supported by record Indian crude imports and talks between OPEC producers and other oil exporters on curbing output to end a glut in the global market.
Global benchmark oil futures, the Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) contracts, have both risen more than 10 percent since the end of September on prospects major crude producers would freeze or cut production to stem an oversupply in the market.
However, doubts remain as to the intentions of major suppliers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran and the effectiveness of any agreement in reining in output from record highs. 
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were up 33 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $52.74 a barrel at 0639 GMT.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were up 20 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement at $50.99 per barrel.
Traders in Asia said oil prices were boosted by record Indian oil imports, which rose 4.4 percent in September from the previous month to a record high 4.47 million barrels per day (bpd) and surged 17.7 percent from a year ago.
The prospect of countries from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC members such as Russia coordinating a production curb will support prices above the $50 mark, market participants have said since an initial agreement was struck at the end of last month.
Government officials from major oil producers, including Russia, are meeting in Istanbul this week to try to lay out more details of production cuts ahead of an official OPEC meeting in November. 
Still, analysts cautioned that a deal might fall through especially as Russia's participation remained uncertain.
""Lots of questions to answer and noises coming from the parties involved can be contradictory. Volatility is all but guaranteed,"" analysts at PVM said in a note.
Much would depend on the timing of any cut, said Alan Gelder, vice president for refining, chemicals and oil markets at Wood Mackenzie, which could deter participation.
""Timing is key for Russia to provide non-OPEC support to re-balancing the oil market, as September was, momentarily, at unprecedented production levels. The production reference (month) could require (Russian state oil producer) Rosneft to curb its current drilling program, which is contrary to the interests of its private shareholders,"" he said.
Oil has rallied more than 13 percent in less than two weeks since OPEC proposed the first production curbs in eight years. But prices remain at about half of mid-2014 highs above $100 a barrel as questions remain over when the market will return to balance.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) added its doubts on Tuesday, saying in a note that the planned oil output cut by OPEC and other exporters has become a ""greater possibility"". But it warned a production cut probably won't be deep enough to re-balance markets in 2017, and that oil prices may fall back into the low $40s per barrel.

The figures, delayed by a day because of a public holiday, will be followed on Thursday by more closely-watched data from the U.S. Department of Energy and the International Energy Agency will release its monthly report on global oil supply and demand.
Last week, data showing U.S. crude supplies fell for the fifth week in a row boosted the demand outlook in the world's largest oil consumer. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude oil inventories fell by 3.0 million barrels last week to 499.7 million, the lowest since January.
On Tuesday, the IEA said in its October report it expected world oil demand to grow at a rate of 1.2 million bpd next year, keeping its forecast unchanged from last month, but cut its estimate of growth in 2016 by 40,000 bpd to around 1.2 million bpd, from around 1.3 million bpd last month.
The IEA forecast a decline of 900,000 bpd in non-OPEC output in 2016 to 56.6 million bpd, and expects a rise of 400,000 bpd in 2017.
Global stockpiles fell for the first time since March, down 10 million barrels to 3.092 billion barrels, just shy of July's record 3.111 billion barrels.
Oil gained on Monday after Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country is prepared to join an oil-output deal which may include a freeze or cut to output.
Speaking at the World Energy Congress in Istanbul, Putin said he hoped OPEC would agree on limits to its crude production in November and that Russia was ready to support that decision. Russia will continue to be a reliable energy supplier, he said.
Putin's bullish comments came after Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he was optimistic a production deal could be reached by November and that it wasn’t “unthinkable” that crude prices could rise another 20% this year to $60 a barrel.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached an agreement to limit production to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held on the sidelines of an energy conference in Algeria late last month, a reduction of 0.7%-to-2.2% from its current output of 33.2 million barrels.
However, market analysts remained skeptical of the deal, pondering how such a plan would be implemented.
The 14-member oil group said it won’t finalize details or complete its production agreement until the group’s next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.
Global oil supply could fall into line more quickly with demand if OPEC and Russia agree to a steep enough cut in production, but it is unclear how rapidly this might happen until more details emerge, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday.

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Climate-change activists were arrested on Tuesday after they shut down five pipelines carrying crude from Canadian oils sands into the U.S. market, the latest move by environmental groups to disrupt movement of oil across North America, an activist group said.
Climate Direct Action said in a press release it had shut down the pipelines to stand in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which has been protesting the construction of a pipeline carrying oil from North Dakota to the U.S. Gulf Coast.
""We are acting in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux who oppose the North Dakota pipeline,"" Sopariwala said. ""We are acting in response to this catastrophe we are facing.""
 Spectra Energy  (NYSE:SE), one of four companies said to be affected, said trespassers had tampered with a valve on its Express Pipeline in Montana and it had shut the line down as a precaution.
The other pipelines claimed to have been shut in are Enbridge's Lines 4 and 67, TransCanada's Keystone pipeline, and Kinder Morgan's TransMountain pipeline. Enbridge said it shut pipelines at a valve site in Leonard, Minnesota, after trespassers cut chains and attempted to turn off vales. The other companies could not immediately be reached for comment.
Afrin Sopariwala, spokeswoman for the activist group, told Reuters protesters shut down the pipelines between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. PT (1330 to 1430 GMT) by manually shutting off valves. In some places they had to cut chains to reach the valves.
All the protesters and their support crews have been arrested, Sopariwala said, with police turning up within 20 to 90 minutes after the valves were turned.
She said the group had spent several months researching how to safely shut down the pipelines.

According to the Duluth News-Tribune, an Enbridge spokeswoman confirmed a company valve station near Clearbrook, Minn., had been tampered with Tuesday morning, although she was unclear if the line had been shut or if there was any damage.

Oil prices that have more than halved since mid-2014 as global supplies swelled.
""I can say that many countries from outside OPEC are willing to join ... we are not talking about support, we are talking about contribution,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Reuters on Tuesday in Istanbul.
Representatives of some OPEC members and non-OPEC countries including Russia, Azerbaijan and possibly Mexico will hold a round-table meeting at 1100 GMT on Wednesday on the sidelines of the World Energy Congress, according to OPEC ministers.
Any deal would initially be applied over six months and then reviewed, OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said. 
""We are confident that the other non-OPEC producers will join this (agreement) because it is in the benefit of all producers ... and also consumers,"" Barkindo said.
Eulogio Del Pino, the petroleum minister for cash-strapped Venezuela said he preferred a deal to extend for a full year in order to include peak output periods of different oil producers. 
Last month in Algiers, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed modest oil output cuts. The goal is to cut production to a range of 32.50-33.0 million barrels per day (bpd). OPEC's current output  is a record 33.6 million bpd.
The International Energy Agency said global oil supply could fall in line with demand more quickly if OPEC and Russia agree to a steep enough cut in production, but it is unclear how rapidly this might happen. [IEA/M]
Any deal would face challenges from a 3 billion barrel global inventory build in recent years as well as efforts by OPEC members Libya and Nigeria to increase production curtailed by conflict. 
Iran, OPEC's third largest member, had said it would not curb its supplies before it reached 4 million barrels per day, a level it had seen before international sanctions were imposed in 2012 and lifted in January this year.
Speaking at the Istanbul conference, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that the world's top producer would maintain its current oil output unchanged under a deal. Russia pumped 11.1 million barrels per day in September.
On Monday, President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was ready to join the proposed cap on oil output by OPEC members.
But Igor Sechin, Russia's most influential oil executive and the head of Kremlin energy champion Rosneft (MM:ROSN), said his company would not curb oil production.
Falih said he would not attend Wednesday's meeting due to prior engagements but met with Novak in Istanbul on Tuesday.
He is due to meet his Russian counterpart for talks later this month in Riyadh, according to a statement by the Saudi energy ministry.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil prices slipped on Tuesday, retreating from one-year highs, after mixed responses by Russian oil industry officials toward an OPEC call for all major crude producers to cut output.
The International Energy Agency, the energy watchdog of the West, also said it unclear how rapidly global oil supply could fall in line with demand even if Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on a steep enough cut. [IEA/M]
""Net, we find that an agreement to cut production, while increasingly likely, remains premature given the high supply uncertainty in 2017 and would prove self-defeating if it were to target sustainably higher oil prices,"" analysts at Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note.
Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was down 35 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $52.79 a barrel by 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT), off the one-year high of $53.73 hit on Monday.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) slipped 35 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $51.
Igor Sechin, Russia's most influential oil executive and the head of Rosneft (MM:ROSN), told Reuters that his company will not cut or freeze oil production as part of a possible agreement with OPEC.
Sechin's remarks came a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said an output freeze or even a production cut were likely the only right decisions to maintain energy sector stability.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak also reiterated Moscow's position on Tuesday that it was ready to work with OPEC. 
OPEC, which groups Saudi Arabia with big oil producers such as Iran, Iraq, Libya, Kuwait and Nigeria and Venezuela, aims to cut 700,000 barrels per day of its own production, bringing output to 32.5-33.0 million bpd by the time of its next policy meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30.
It will be OPEC's first output reduction in eight years and comes two years after an oil glut forced crude prices down from highs above $100 a barrel. OPEC has asked non-OPEC producers besides Russia to contribute with cuts too, although the United States, the world's No. 1 oil producer, will not be part of the plan.
Analysts worry that if crude prices maintain their recent upward momentum, production of U.S. shale oil, crimped this year by prices as low as nearly $26 a barrel, will begin to increase again. [RIG/U]
""A part of the described upside may anyway occur without prices having to average $60 due to improved hedging opportunities currently already in place,"" analysts at JBC Energy said.

Goldman Sachs said there could be poor compliance with the output cut plan by non-core OPEC producers, exemptions for countries such as Libya, Nigeria and Iran, and increased supply by non-OPEC countries in 2017.

407,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2016 08:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Russia's Rosneft boss Sechin says no to OPEC oil cap,"By Olesya Astakhova
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Igor Sechin, Russia's most influential oil executive and the head of state-controlled energy giant Rosneft, said his company will not cap oil production as part of a possible agreement with OPEC.
His comments underline how difficult it is for Russia to get its oil companies to freeze or cut output as part of a potential deal with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries designed to support oil prices.
President Vladimir Putin told an energy congress on Monday that Russia was ready to join a proposed OPEC cap but did not provide the details. 
""Why should we do it?"" Sechin, known for his anti-OPEC position, told Reuters in Istanbul on Monday evening, when asked if Rosneft, which accounts for 40 percent of Russia's crude oil output, might cap its production.
Earlier on Monday, Sechin told reporters that Rosneft planned this year to raise its oil production, already the world's largest among listed producers, above the 203 million tonnes (4.1 million barrels per day) it produced in 2015.
Sechin said he doubted some OPEC countries, such as Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, would cut their output either: ""Try to answer this question yourself: would Iran, Saudi Arabia or Venezuela cut their production?"" 
OPEC's oil output is likely to reach its highest in recent history in September, as Iraq boosted northern exports and Libya reopened some of its main oil terminals.
FUTILE ATTEMPTS
There have been several attempts in the past for Russia and OPEC to join forces to stabilize oil markets. Those efforts have never come to fruition, however.
Russia's oil industry has argued for years that it cannot cut output to support falling global prices for purely technical reasons linked to the climate in Siberia; in reality it can - as long as it has the political will.
Putin could in theory force companies to cut their production or postpone the launch of new oilfields.
Russia was already pumping at the post-Soviet record high of 11.1 million barrels per day in September thanks to a recovery in oil prices which triggered exploration drilling activity.
""Given the propensity of OPEC and other producers to talk up prices, and the history of failed deals among OPEC and between OPEC and Russia, we would continue to treat the news somewhat carefully for the longer term,"" Sberbank CIB said in a note. 
The Russian oil landscape is dominated by a handful of players -- second-biggest firm, private Lukoil, private producer Surgut, state-owned Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) Neft and Tatneft.
The companies plan to raise production by about 1.6 percent on average in 2017, according to their forecasts and Reuters calculations as they benefit from a weaker rouble and cheaper costs at home.
Sechin has long argued that any oil price increase as a result of joint actions by OPEC and non-OPEC members will allow the United States to resume production growth from high-cost shale deposits.

""The Americans want it most ($50 per barrel) as the shale oil projects become profitable with such a price. And $60 (per barrel) will result in more shale oil projects,"" Sechin told Reuters.

408,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2016 04:38AM ET</span>",IEA says oil market may rebalance faster if OPEC sticks to target,"By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - Global oil supply could fall in line with demand more quickly if OPEC and Russia agree to a steep enough cut in production, but it is unclear how rapidly this might happen, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday. 
OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, agreed last month to cut production to around 32.5 to 33 million barrels per day (bpd) and Russia has signaled it is ready to join in any effort to temper supply and shrink a stubborn global surplus of unwanted crude.
Oversupply helped send oil prices from $115 a barrel in June 2014 to as low as $27 in January this year. Crude has since recovered to around $50 on expectations of a production cut. 
The IEA said in its August report it expected world oil demand to grow at a rate of 1.2 million bpd next year, keeping its forecast unchanged from last month, but cut its estimate of growth in 2016 by 40,000 bpd to around 1.2 million bpd, from around 1.3 million bpd last month. 
""Even with tentative signs that bulging inventories are starting to decline, our supply-demand outlook suggests that the market -- if left to its own devices -- may remain in oversupply through the first half of next year,"" the IEA said. ""If OPEC sticks to its new target, the market's rebalancing could come faster.""
""At this stage, it is difficult to assess how the OPEC supply cut, if enforced, will affect market balances,"" the agency added.
""A significant rebound in production from Libya and Nigeria and further growth from Iran would suggest that bigger cuts would have to be made by others, such as Saudi Arabia, to meet the ... production target.""
OPEC members meet next month in Vienna.
Iran is recovering market share after years of Western sanctions, in Libya, civil unrest has cut production and a series of attacks on oil infrastructure have curtailed Nigerian supply.
All three are expected to be exempt from any coordinated cuts, meaning that the onus will likely rest on some of the higher-producing members, such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
The IEA forecast a decline of 900,000 bpd in non-OPEC output in 2016 to 56.6 million bpd, and expects a rise of 400,000 bpd in 2017.
Global stockpiles fell for the first time since March, down 10 million barrels to 3.092 billion barrels, just shy of July's record 3.111 billion barrels.
""The fall in stockpiles was largely driven by crude, which fell in all OECD regions and especially sharply in Asia Oceania. This brought crude stocks back to early February levels. Refined product stocks across the OECD hit yet another historic high as refineries increased runs in August,"" the IEA said.
The agency said global demand growth has continued to slow after hitting a five-year high of 2.5 million bpd in the third quarter of last year, to a four-year low of 800,000 bpd in the third quarter of this year, due to ""...vanishing OECD growth and a marked deceleration in China.""

Brent oil for December delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London shed 24 cents, or 0.45%, to $52.90 a barrel by 4:15AM ET (08:15GMT). A day earlier, London-traded Brent prices soared to $53.73, a level not seen since October 9, 2015.
Elsewhere, crude oil for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped 19 cents, or 0.37%, to $51.17 a barrel after climbing to $51.60 on Monday, the most since June 9.
Oil's gains on Monday came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country is prepared to join an oil-output deal which may include a freeze or cut to output.
Speaking at the World Energy Congress in Istanbul, Putin said he hoped OPEC would agree on limits to its crude production in November and that Russia was ready to support that decision. Russia will continue to be a reliable energy supplier, he said.
Putin's bullish comments came after Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he was optimistic a production deal could be reached by November and that it wasn’t “unthinkable” that crude prices could rise another 20% this year to $60 a barrel.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached an agreement to limit production to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held on the sidelines of an energy conference in Algeria late last month, a reduction of 0.7%-to-2.2% from its current output of 33.2 million barrels.
However, market analysts remained skeptical of the deal, pondering how such a plan would be implemented.
The 14-member oil group said it won’t finalize details or complete its production agreement until the group’s next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.

Markets are currently pricing in around a 74% chance of a rate hike at December's meeting, According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.25% at 97.15 early Tuesday, within sight of a more than two-month high of 97.21 touched late last week.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.

""Higher production from Libya, Nigeria and Iraq are reducing the odds of such a deal rebalancing the oil market in 2017,"" Goldman analysts said in a note to clients dated Oct. 10.

OPEC's top producer Saudi Arabia said on Monday that a global deal to cut supplies could be reached at the group's next formal meeting in November, when non-OPEC nations such as Russia could be invited to join in the pact. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin told an energy congress on Monday that Russia was ready to join a proposed cap on oil output by OPEC members. 
Goldman said Saudi Arabia likely holds the reins to the production cut agreement, with signs of elevated funding stress potentially driving Saudi to commit to a cut when OPEC meets officially on November 30. 
OPEC officials are embarking on a flurry of meetings to nail down details of the deal in Algiers, where modest oil output cuts were agreed in the first such deal since 2008.
""As usual, risks of a disagreement are not negligible with Iraq currently the most vocal opponent, aiming to grow production next year and disputing usual measures of its production as too low,"" Goldman analysts said. 
The bank said it sees price-insensitive upside risks to global oil production from the countries outside OPEC and expects them to aggravate supply with 40 percent more new projects in 2017 from 2016. 
Goldman said even if OPEC producers and Russia implemented strict cuts, higher prices would allow U.S. shale drillers to raise output. 

""Demand growth will remain resilient in our view but the historical activity and price sensitivities suggest less growth at higher oil prices,"" the investment bank said.

415,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2016 12:40PM ET</span>",Global oil producers say possible to reach output cut when OPEC meets,"By Rania El Gamal and Ron Bousso
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - OPEC's top oil producer Saudi Arabia said on Monday a global production deal to limit supplies could be reached by the group's next formal meeting in November, when an invitation to join cuts could be extended to non-OPEC nations such as Russia.
""OPEC needs to make sure we don't crimp too tightly and create a shock to the market. We are going to be very responsible,"" Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told the World Energy Congress in Istanbul, adding that OPEC needed to behave in a balanced and responsible manner.
Last month in Algiers, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed modest oil output cuts. The goal is to cut production to a range of 32.50-33.0 million barrels per day (bpd). OPEC's current output  is a record 33.6 million bpd.
""Prices have dropped too low and that has impacted investment. Many companies and countries are hurting ... we don't want to give the market the wrong signal and shock the market's prices,"" Falih said, adding he was optimistic that the deal could be reached next month. 
Non-OPEC oil producer Russia's President Vladimir Putin welcomed the global cut invitation, saying Moscow was ready to join the proposed cap on oil output by OPEC members.
Putin said low oil prices had led to underinvestment in the global energy sector which would turn into a deficit at some point and trigger new ""unpredictable jumps"" in prices. 
""That's why in the current situation we think that (an oil output) freeze or even an oil production cut is likely to be the only right decision to maintain the stability of the global energy sector,"" Putin said, hoping that OPEC members would confirm the decision to adopt quotas for output in November.
""Russia is ready to join the joint measures to cap production and is calling for other oil exporters to join.""
Brent crude prices rose to their highest in a year on Monday after Russia said it was ready to join a proposed deal to cap oil output in a bid to stem a two-year price slide.
Global benchmark Brent crude futures (LCOc1) reached the highest since Oct. 12, 2015 at $53.22 a barrel at 1335 GMT, up $1.29 on Friday's close. U.S. futures (CLc1) also gained ground, reaching a four-month high of $51.10 a barrel.
DELICATE AND CRITICAL
However, the delicate and critical issue of how much each of the 14 OPEC members will produce, is to be decided at the November formal OPEC meeting. Putin did not say at what level Russia would be ready to cap its production.
Iran, with a heavily oil-reliant economy, believes its fair production share in OPEC should be higher than its current output and has accelerated its efforts to reach its production before 2012, when the European Union imposed additional sanctions on the country for its nuclear activities. 
Sanctions were eased in January in return for Iran curbing its nuclear program under a landmark deal reached between Iran and six major powers in 2015.
Between 2012 and 2016, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf OPEC members have raised output to compete for market share with higher-cost producers such as the United States. Saudi output has risen to 10.7 million bpd from 10.2 million in recent months due to local needs for summer cooling.
No decision is expected in Istanbul, OPEC sources have said, but it is a chance for officials to discuss the next steps after the Algiers deal, which was agreed after intensive shuttle diplomacy.
Falih said Saudi Arabia would be prepared to deal with whatever price may emerge.
""We have economic and fiscal plans to deal with very low (price) scenarios and moderate price scenarios,"" he said.
Falih said there was still not total clarity on supply and demand in some areas such as China and North America at the moment and that he hoped the situation would be clearer by the time of OPEC's Nov. 30 meeting.
""It is time to do something different than we faced in 2014. It is a very gentle hand on the wheel, we are not doing anything dramatic ... The difference is that the market forces have shifted significantly between 2014 and now.""
Russia's energy ministry said on Friday an output freeze deal could be reached before the OPEC meeting..
Algerian Energy Minister Nouredine Bouterfa said he expected to see commitments on supply cuts from non-OPEC oil producers, describing the Istanbul gathering as ""consultations"". 
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro also hoped for ""fairer and more realistic"" global oil prices, adding that Venezuela was ready to be part of any alliance among oil producer countries. 

""OPEC members should reach an agreement and should work for the stability of the oil industry. Prices must be fairer, more realistic, and they should be an incentive for investors. For that we need fair prices,"" Maduro told the Congress in Istanbul, according to a translation of his comments.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose around one percent on Monday, approaching one-year highs, as speculators raised bets that oil prices would gain on the back of a landmark agreement among OPEC producers to rein in record output levels.
Global benchmark Brent crude futures (LCOc1) reached a high of $52.57 a barrel, not far off a one-year high of $52.86 a barrel, by 1207, up 64 cents on Friday's close.
U.S. futures (CLc1) also gained ground, trading at $50.32, up 51 cents.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) aims to agree an output cut by the time it meets in late November. The goal is to cut production to a range of 32.50 million barrels per day (bpd) to 33.0 million bpd.
OPEC's current output  is a record 33.6 million bpd.
The news fueled an oil price rally last week which led to speculators making a record increase in bullish positions on Brent crude prices, latest data from InterContinental Exchange (ICE) showed. [O/ICE]
Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday he was optimistic a global production deal to limit supplies could be reached at an OPEC meeting scheduled for the end of next month.
He also said he would meet Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak in Istanbul in the coming days to discuss Russia's reaction to last month's agreement, and that a technical committee meeting between OPEC members and non-OPEC countries would take place in two weeks.
Novak, however, said Moscow preferred an output freeze over a cut.
""We in general will look at this (proposal) but I think that for us a more favorable situation would be to maintain output levels,"" he said, attending the World Energy Congress in Istanbul.
Analysts at ABN Amro took a more cautious view on an OPEC deal, saying previous hints by the group of output cuts have always failed to be followed up by action.
""Adding to these doubts is the realization that certain OPEC countries are demanding to be treated as exceptions,"" analysts said, referring to Libya and Nigeria, whose production has been affected by domestic unrest.

Iraq, OPEC's second biggest producer, had already poured cold water on expectations, saying over the weekend that it wants to raise output further in 2017.

He added that the oil group needed to ensure it does not crimp oil supply too tightly and give the market a harmful shock.

Energy ministers who will be present in Istanbul as it hosts the congress include those of the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Venezuela and Qatar, which holds the OPEC presidency.
The meeting in Istanbul is expected to be more bilateral gatherings rather than one single meeting of both OPEC and non-OPEC states, one OPEC source said on Sunday.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached an agreement to limit production to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held on the sidelines of an energy conference in Algeria late last month, a reduction of 0.7%-to-2.2% from its current output of 33.2 million barrels.
However, market analysts remained skeptical of the deal, pondering how such a plan would be implemented.
The 14-member oil group said it won’t finalize details or complete its production agreement until the group’s next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.
London-traded Brent futures rallied to $52.84 last week, the most since June 9. The contract surged $1.74, or 3.35%, last week, the third straight weekly gain.

Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week rose by 3 to 428, marking the 14th increase in 15 weeks.

New York-traded oil touched a four-month peak of $50.74 in the prior session. The benchmark rose $1.57, or 3.15%, last week, after posting gains in each of the past two weeks.

433,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2016 11:50AM ET</span>",Philippines looks to China for farms 'windfall' when fruit ban ends,"By Karen Lema
MANILA (Reuters) - China will lift a Philippine fruit ban and explore broader farm and fisheries imports and investments in its fledgling farm sector, the Philippine agriculture minister said, signaling serious intent by Manila to beef up business with Beijing.
China would resume shipments from 27 blacklisted fruit exporters as a ""gift"" when President Rodrigo Duterte visits with a business delegation from Oct. 19-21, Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol told Reuters on Sunday.
""I would look at that as a goodwill move,"" he said. ""The atmosphere would be positive.""
Pinol's comments suggest Duterte is following through on his promises to build a commercial alliance with China, made repeatedly in speeches in which he has angrily alluded to cutting ties with the United States and reaching out to its geopolitical rivals.
The trade talk with China is hugely symbolic and marks a stark turnaround in ties since a July arbitration ruling in The Hague went in Manila's favor and angered Beijing by invalidating its claim to almost the entire South China Sea.
Duterte is forging ahead, even as mistrust lingers over China's four-year blockade of Filipino fishermen at the Scarborough Shoal.
Pinol said ending the ban on bananas and pineapples would boost demand in other parts of a farm sector that has seen its output contract for two successive quarters.
""Since we are not involved in the diplomatic issues, we are just looking at this as a windfall for Philippine agriculture because China, we have to admit, is our biggest market for our agriculture products,"" he said by phone.
""The interest of China in importing fisheries products will spur development,"" he said, adding the demand would see Filipino farmers ramp up their output.
SHRINKING OUTPUT
Agriculture accounts for about one-tenth of the Philippine economy. Farm output dropped 4.4 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, followed by a 2.1 percent contraction in the second quarter, according to government data.
Together with the impact of the El Nino weather pattern, the ban, he said, had seen earnings from banana shipments down by half in 2015 from about $1.1 billion in 2014.
Pinol said Beijing's ambassador to the Philippines had informed him China would look to import mango and dragon fruit, plus fisheries produce like crab, shrimp, grouper and milkfish. China imported just 6.3 percent of the Philippines' $1.3 billion in seafood shipments in 2014, compared to 25 percent to the United States, according to most recent official data.
Finance secretary, Carlos Dominguez, on Saturday told Reuters Duterte was seeking billions of dollars of Chinese infrastructure investments, including rail lines and power grids.
Duterte's defense minister on Friday said moves were afoot also to acquire Chinese arms.
Pinol was hopeful that an invitation by the Bank of China to attend events in China could create opportunities to secure much-needed financing, and he said he expected China to very soon increase imports of different produce because its export firms were already active in the Philippines.
""That should happen fast because there are Chinese groups here waiting for the ban to be lifted,"" he said.
""These are exporting companies and they buy their produce from farmers.""

OPEC sources and the Russian energy minister had said on Thursday that ministers from the two countries would be among representatives of OPEC states at the meeting in Istanbul, which is hosting the World Energy Congress.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on Sept. 28 a deal to limit crude production and is looking to secure the cooperation of non-OPEC members such as Russia to help support oil prices.
The meeting in Istanbul is expected to be more bilateral gatherings rather than one single meeting of both OPEC and non-OPEC states, one OPEC source said on Sunday, dismissing prospects of any decisions being taken in the Turkish city.
Energy ministers who will be present in Istanbul as it hosts the congress include those of the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Venezuela and Qatar, which holds the OPEC presidency.

The agreement reached in Algiers is expected to be implemented this year and OPEC ministers will next meet in Vienna on Nov. 30 to set the group's supply policy.

Jabar al-Luaibi's comments came as OPEC nations are trying to implement an agreement to curb oil output for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, in order to push up crude prices.
The ministry's statement quoted remarks Luaibi made to a meeting of Iraq oil industry executives in the southern oil city of Basra to review the ministry's oilfields' development plans. 
It made no mention of the decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Sept. 28 to reduce output to a range of between 32.50 million barrels per day and 33.0 million bpd. 
OPEC's production stood at around 33.6 million bpd in September, according to a Reuters survey that put Iraq's output at 4.43 million bpd.
The minister ""has affirmed the need to proceed forth with increasing oil and gas production through enhancing the national effort and those of the licensed companies for the remainder of 2016 and also for 2017,"" the statement said.
Foreign companies' oil output targets ""should be reached within the assigned periods,"" the ministry quoted Luaibi as saying.
The ministry also aims to increase associated gas output by adding 350 to 450 million cubic feet a day to the nation's production in 2017, Luaibi said.
Natural gas output levels in Iraq's southern region are tied to crude production levels as the two are produced from the same reservoirs.

437,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2016 11:00PM ET</span>",China says EU duties on Chinese steel are unfair,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Commerce Ministry has expressed concern and regret after the European Union set provisional import duties on two types of Chinese steel coming into the bloc, calling its investigation methods ""unfair"". 
The duties announced on Friday are the latest in a line of trade defenses set up against Chinese steel imports over the past two years to counter what EU steel producers say is a flood of steel sold at a loss due to Chinese overcapacity. 
Some 5,000 jobs have been axed in the British steel industry in the past year as it struggles to compete with cheap Chinese imports and high energy costs.
G20 governments recognized last month that steel overcapacity was a serious problem. China, the source of 50 percent of the world's steel and the largest steel consumer, has said the problem is a global one.
The substitute country investigation method used by the EU, a practice typically reserved for countries deemed non-market economies, are ""unfair and unreasonable"" and ""seriously damage the interests of Chinese enterprises,"" the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted to its website late on Saturday.
""Reckless trade protectionism and mistaken methods that limit fair market competition are not the proper ways to develop the European Union steel industry,"" it said.
Chinese steel products represent less than 5 percent of the European market and do not present a serious threat to European industry, the ministry said. The root cause of Europe's steel problems was not trade but weak economic growth, it said.
""China hopes the EU will strictly respect relevant World Trade Organization rules and fully guarantee Chinese companies' right to protest,"" the ministry said.
The EU's duties are set at between 13.2 and 22.6 percent for hot-rolled flat iron and steel products and at between 65.1 and 73.7 percent for heavy-plate steel.
As provisional duties they are in place for up to six months until the European Commission completes its investigation. If upheld, they would typically be set for five years.
The commission has committed to speed up its trade defense actions under pressure from EU producers.
The EU has also been debating whether to grant China ""market economy status"", given the Chinese government's hand in guiding industry and markets. China says the status is its right come December, which marks 15 years since it joined the WTO. Failure to do so could spark a trade war.

The commission has said that China is not a market economy and that it would not recognize it as such, but would adopt a new method to set duties that would abide by WTO rules.

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC officials are embarking on an unusual flurry of meetings in the next six weeks, OPEC sources said on Friday, to nail down details of their deal to cut production agreed last week in Algiers.
The chain of meetings, starting with ministers in Istanbul next week, signal that unlike in the first half of 2016, the exporting group is more serious now about managing the global supply glut and propping up prices.
First up, OPEC energy ministers will be meeting each other and Russian officials for informal talks on oil output in Istanbul next week as the Turkish city hosts the World Energy Congress from Oct. 9-13. 
Citing Energy Minister Alexander Novak, Russia's energy ministry said in a statement on Friday it expected an output freeze deal could be reached before the OPEC meeting on Nov. 30. [R4N1C901L]
No decision however is expected to be taken in Istanbul, OPEC sources said, but the meeting will be a chance for the officials to discuss the next step after the Algiers deal, which was agreed after intensive shuttle diplomacy.
""I have been extremely engaged in recent weeks,"" said an OPEC official involved in the talks.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Sept. 28 agreed to reduce output to a range of 32.50 million barrels per day to 33.0 million bpd, its first output cut since the 2008 financial crisis.
But ministers left aside the delicate and critical issue of how much each of the 14 OPEC members will produce, handing the matter to what the group terms a High Level Committee. 
This committee, which will probably include OPEC governors and national representatives - officials who report to their respective ministers - will work out details of country allocations ahead of OPEC's next ministerial meeting on Nov. 30.
""Everyone will be very busy until the end of November,"" said another OPEC source.
The committee's first meeting is expected to take place at OPEC's Vienna headquarters around Oct. 28-29, OPEC sources said. This will be followed by meetings of the OPEC governors to discuss OPEC's long-term strategy - delayed due to disagreements last year - and other administrative issues from Nov. 1-4.
Then, a technical meeting of OPEC's national representatives will again meet in Vienna on Nov. 23-24, followed possibly by a second meeting of the High Level Committee on Nov. 25, OPEC sources said, which will then present its recommendations to the ministers when they meet on Nov.30.
The number of meetings is not on the scale of the early 2000s, when OPEC oil ministers met as many as seven times a year to micro manage supply policy, but it represents an increase in activity from the last few years.
""Consultations remain ongoing among the OPEC-14, the High Level Committee initiated by the OPEC conference is moving forward on the implementation of the Algiers decision,"" said OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo in a speech at the G-24 ministerial meeting in Washington. 

""Steps are being taken to further develop a framework for high-level consultations between OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries. We believe there is firm and common ground for continuous collaborative efforts among producers, both within and outside OPEC.""

439,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2016 10:10AM ET</span>",Libya's eastern authorities say oil money will go to Tripoli central bank,"By Ayman al-Warfalli
BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Authorities in eastern Libya will allow revenues from rising oil production to be paid into the central bank in Tripoli even though they do not recognize the bank's governor there, the head of Libya's eastern parliament told Reuters in an interview.
The pledge is a sign authorities in the east, who have resisted a U.N.-backed unity government in Tripoli, may not try to take direct control of oil resources and revenues, at least for now. They have previously failed in attempts to export oil independently.
Agila Saleh, president of the east's House of Representatives (HOR), said production should be managed by a unified National Oil Corporation (NOC) and revenues distributed fairly across Libya.
His comments came after the state-run NOC reopened major oil terminals seized last month by eastern military commander Khalifa Haftar, boosting national production by more than 200,000 barrels per day (bpd).
""The revenues of oil will be deposited in the central bank of Libya and will be for all Libyans according to geographic distribution and density of population,"" Saleh said. ""All Libyans benefit from this wealth.""
The HOR has been based in the eastern city of Tobruk since 2014, when rival armed factions took control of Tripoli, deepening the political turmoil and conflict that emerged after an uprising toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
Libya was left with two competing sets of institutions in Tripoli and the east, including rival branches of the NOC and the central bank.
The U.N.-backed government is now operating from Tripoli, but has failed to win endorsement from the east. Its leadership is currently drawing up a new list of ministers after seeing two proposed cabinets rejected by the HOR.
The NOC announced a deal to unite in July. The central bank is still divided, though NOC revenues continued to go through the bank's Tripoli headquarters throughout Libya's conflict.
Saleh he was planning to meet NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla and eastern central bank governor Ali Hibri, noting the HOR had previously sacked Tripoli central bank governor Sadiq al-Kabir.
""We will work to draft a new agreement with the (eastern) parliament's finance committee for harmonizing operations in the Libyan central bank and the NOC,"" he said.
GROWING PRODUCTION
Conflict, political disputes and local protests had reduced Libya's oil output to a fraction of the 1.6 million bpd the OPEC member was producing before the 2011 uprising.
Following the NOC's reopening of terminals seized by Haftar, national production rose this week above 500,000 bpd, from lows over the summer of between 200,000 and 300,000 bpd.
The European Union and the United States have imposed sanctions on Saleh, accusing him of blocking political progress in Libya. HOR members who support the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) have said they were repeatedly obstructed from holding or participating in votes to approve it.
Saleh dismissed the sanctions as a ""violation of Libyan sovereignty and democracy"". He said he would accept civil society observers to monitor any future vote, but they had to be Libyan.
""The government has to be small, given the condition of the country, and it has to take into account all parts of Libya, east and west, and all constituents of the Libyan people,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Brent crude futures fell on Friday after briefly nearing their 2016 high, as financial market confidence in the rally came up against a physical excess of crude. 
Brent (LCOc1) traded at $52.11 at 1000 GMT, 40 cents down, after touching $52.84 earlier, two cents below the 2016 high. 
U.S. oil futures traded as high as $50.74 a barrel, a three and a half month high, before falling by 30 cents to $50.14 a barrel. On Thursday they settled at $50.44 per barrel - the first settlement above $50 since June 23.
The rally had come despite a strengthening dollar, which makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies, and increases to physical oil supply coming from Libya, Nigeria and Russia. 
Some of the support came from Hurricane Matthew in the U.S. Gulf, which could disrupt U.S. oil imports and lead to fuel shortages.
But the overall strength came from speculation that a deal struck last week by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members to curtail production would finally stem a two-year overhang. OPEC leaders were also expected to meet with officials from oil producing behemoth Russia next week.
But analysts said the agreement's support was fragile, given the overhang of physical crude oil. 
""This isn't really sustainable,"" Hamza Khan, head of commodities strategy with ING, said of the rally, adding that fears the hurricane could impact U.S. oil stocks were one of the only fundamental factors supporting the market. ""It all could be over by next week.""
Both front-month contracts above $50 per barrel and each forward curve in contango, in which contracts for future delivery are more expensive than those for immediate sale, the entire crude futures complex has moved back over $50 per barrel. (Chart: http://tmsnrt.rs/2dz0bQH)
Some warned this could ultimately hurt OPEC member nations by giving a boost to other producers. 
""Many U.S. shale oil producers have now hedged their production, which is likely to put the brakes on the price rise,"" anaylsts at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note. ""In other words, OPEC is shooting itself in the foot in the medium to long term."" 

Top exporter Saudi Arabia cut its benchmark crude prices to Asia this week, while Libya exported the first oil tanker from the port of Zuetina since 2015, adding to global supplies.

(Reuters) - Oil analysts are not convinced that OPEC's proposal to cut output for the first time since 2008 will result in much higher prices, as doubts run high over the feasibility of the group's decision, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
The 32 analysts and economists surveyed cut their 2016 average Brent (LCOc1) price outlook to $44.74 a barrel from the $45.44 forecast in August, the second straight downward revision after successive upgrades in the five preceding surveys. 
Brent, which has averaged $43.34 this year, was forecast at$57.28 a barrel in 2017 as against the previous outlook of $57.90.
""We are pessimistic about the chances of a comprehensive deal being reached at OPEC's November meeting due to a history of reluctance from producers to agree to, or adhere to individual output quotas,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Ashley Petersen said. 
In an informal meeting in Algiers last month, OPEC agreed to reduce output to a range of 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day, in a bid to end the ""production war"" that has caused a supply glut and led to an over 50-percent slump in prices since mid-2014.     
The cartel is likely to seek support from non-OPEC members like Russia ahead of its next formal meeting in late November, when it is expected to make a decision on production quotas for its member countries.
Energy ministers from Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq will be among representatives of key OPEC producers meeting with Russia for informal talks next week on the sidelines of a major energy conference in Istanbul.
""The biggest stumbling block in the whole process is going to be whether they can get all countries to agree upon quota levels,"" said FirstEnergy (NYSE:FE) Capital analyst Martin King.  
""It has been a sticky point for the cartel in the last couple of years.""
Supply from OPEC has risen to 33.60 million bpd in September from a revised 33.53 million bpd in August, according to a survey based on shipping data and information from industry sources.
Oversupply is expected to continue presenting challenges for the market since inventories have risen to multi-year highs in numerous locations, said Giorgos Beleris, analyst at Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts.
A rebalancing before mid-2017 was unlikely, even though global demand could increase by over 1 million bpd next year, analysts said.
""We expect any gains in a freeze scenario will be quickly reversed as production will be frozen at very high levels, thus still leaving the market with excess supply, which only pushes back further into late 2017 the prospect of a rebalancing in the oil market,""  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Global Head of Commodity Markets Strategy Harry Tchilinguirian said. 
The poll forecast U.S. light crude (CLc1) will average $43.49 a barrel in 2016 and $55.46 in 2017, compared with the $41.69 average this year.    

Morgan Stanley had the lowest 2016 forecast for Brent at $42 a barrel, while Bernstein and ABN Amro had the highest at $50.

On Wednesday, New York-traded oil rallied $1.14, or 2.34%, after weekly data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed that crude oil inventories fell by 3.0 million barrels last week to 499.7 million, the lowest since January.

449,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2016 05:26PM ET</span>",Oil hits four-month highs as OPEC keeps talks of cuts in focus,"By Barani Krishnan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose more than 1 percent to four-month highs on Thursday, spurred by another informal OPEC meeting on output cuts and plunging U.S. crude inventories, with some saying the market has overshot itself with a near 15-percent gain in seven sessions.
Saudi, Iranian and Iraqi energy ministers will be among key OPEC representatives to meet non-OPEC member Russia on the sidelines of an energy conference next week in Istanbul, OPEC sources said.
Oil has gained more than $6 a barrel since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced at informal talks in Algeria on Sept. 28 that it hopes to reduce output to 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day. That would remove about 700,000 bpd from a global glut estimated by analysts at 1.0 million-1.5 million bpd.
On top of OPEC's pledged output cuts, prices were supported by the surprise drop in U.S. crude stocks for a fifth week in a row, bringing the total drawdown since the beginning of September to 26 million barrels, according to government data on Wednesday. [EIA/S]
Brent crude (LCOc1) settled up 65 cents, or 1.3 percent, at $52.51 a barrel. It rose earlier to $52.65, its highest since June 9.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) closed up 61 cents, or 1.2 percent, at $50.44. It was WTI's first settlement above $50 since June 24.
The Relative Strength Index for both benchmarks were at 69 -- just below the 70 level for a technically overbought market.
Earlier on Thursday, prices pared gains briefly after energy monitoring service Genscape reported a build of nearly 1 million barrels in stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery base for WTI during the week to Oct 4. 
""It's really crazy these markets,"" said Carsten Fritsch, commodities strategist for Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt. ""Prices rise, regardless of the news flow and any dip is being seen as buying opportunity.""
Oil crashed from above $100 a barrel in mid-2014 to around $26 in February this year from oversupply of up to 2 million bpd and OPEC's refusal then to cut output. 
OPEC's policy meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30 will decide how the group's members would contribute to the pledged cuts.
Algeria's Energy Minister Nouredine Bouterfa told local media OPEC could ultimately reduce output by another 1 percent above the 700,000 bpd agreed in Algeria.

""We expect that Saudi will shoulder the bulk of the production cuts with a reduction of 5 percent or 0.5 million bpd, with other Gulf States cutting by 0.3 million bpd,"" Bernstein Energy said in a note, adding that Iran, Libya and Nigeria were likely to get a ""pass"".

DUBAI (Reuters) - Energy ministers from Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq will be among representatives of key OPEC producers meeting Russian officials for informal talks on oil output in Istanbul next week, OPEC sources and the Russian energy minister said on Thursday.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last week agreed a deal to limit crude production and is looking to secure the cooperation of non-OPEC members such as Russia to help to support oil prices.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday that he planned to meet OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo in Istanbul, RIA news agency reported, adding that the minister said he planned to discuss OPEC's output deal with ministers of other oil-producing countries.
Other energy ministers who will be present in the Turkish city as it hosts the World Energy Congress include those of the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Venezuela and Qatar, which holds the OPEC presidency.
No decision is expected to be taken in Istanbul, the sources said, but the meeting will be a chance for the officials to discuss the next step after last week's Algiers meeting.

The agreement reached in Algiers is expected to be implemented this year and OPEC ministers will meet next in Vienna on Nov. 30 to set the group's supply policy.

Natural gas for delivery in November on the New York Mercantile Exchange slumped 5.4 cents, or 1.78%, to $2.986 per million British thermal units by 10:33AM ET (14:33GMT). Futures were at around $3.030 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 80 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 30, above expectations for an increase of 70 billion cubic feet.
That compared with a gain of 49 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 97 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 95 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.680 trillion cubic feet, 2% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 5.6% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Gas futures have made a dramatic recovery in recent months, rising nearly 50% since hitting a 20-year low of $1.611 in early March, as an unusually warm summer helped trim a supply surplus that was weighing on prices.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said gold investors may pursue much of their lawsuit accusing four major banks of conspiring for a decade to fix prices and exploit distortions at the expense of investors in global markets for the precious metal.
Antitrust and manipulation claims can move forward against  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC), Bank of Nova Scotia (""ScotiaBank"") (TO:BNS),  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan said in a decision made public on Tuesday.
Investors allege that the banks conspired from 2004 to 2013 to fix prices. They did not estimate the size of the banks' gold portfolios, but said the gold derivatives market alone was as large as $650 billion during the class period.
""From the gold plaintiffs' standpoint, it's a very substantial victory,"" Dan Brockett, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan representing the investors, said in a phone interview on Wednesday.
 Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) settled related claims in April, and the investors plan to seek preliminary approval of a settlement, Brockett said.
Terms have not been disclosed, but Deutsche Bank has put the expected payment in escrow, he said.
In a separate case involving the silver market, Caproni said another group of investors may pursue market rigging claims against ScotiaBank and HSBC.
Both decisions dismissed UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) as a defendant, saying there was nothing showing it manipulated prices, even if it benefited from market distortions.
Barclays spokesman Andrew Smith, ScotiaBank spokesman Rick Roth, Societe Generale spokesman Jim Galvin and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Amanda Williams declined to comment. UBS spokeswoman Erica Chase said the bank is pleased with the decisions. HSBC had no immediate comment.
Investors have several lawsuits before the Manhattan court accusing banks of conspiring to rig rates and prices in financial and commodities markets.
In the gold case, investors said Barclays, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, ScotiaBank and Societe Generale conspired to manipulate prices of gold, gold futures and options, and gold derivatives through twice-a-day meetings to set the London Gold Fixing.
The investors said this conspiracy let the banks suppress prices and reduce risk at other investors' expense.
In her 73-page decision, Caproni said the investors plausibly alleged that the five banks recklessly created ""artificial price dynamics"" for gold, and that their misconduct was the ""proximate cause"" of the distortions.

465,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2016 11:30AM ET</span>","UBS is dismissed in U.S. silver lawsuit, other claims narrowed","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has dismissed UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) as a defendant in a lawsuit accusing big banks of conspiring to fix silver prices and exploit price distortions at investors' expense.
In a decision made public on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan also said investors may pursue some but not all antitrust and manipulation claims against Bank of Nova Scotia (""ScotiaBank"") (TO:BNS) and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA).
 Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) settled related claims in April, and the investors plan soon to seek preliminary approval of a settlement, their lawyer Vincent Briganti said on Wednesday. Terms have not been disclosed.
UBS spokeswoman Erica Chase said the Swiss bank is pleased the court accepted its arguments. Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Amanda Williams declined to comment. HSBC and ScotiaBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit is one of many in the Manhattan court in which investors have accused banks of conspiring to rig rates and prices in financial and commodities markets.
Investors claimed that Deutsche Bank, HSBC and ScotiaBank rigged silver prices through a secret daily meeting called the Silver Fix, and accused UBS of exploiting that fix.
The alleged conspiracy started by 1999, suppressed prices on roughly $30 billion of silver and silver financial instruments traded each year, and enabled the banks to pocket returns that could top 100 percent annualized, the investors said.
Caproni said the investors sufficiently, ""albeit barely,"" alleged that Deutsche Bank, HSBC and ScotiaBank violated U.S. antitrust law by conspiring opportunistically to depress the Silver Fix from January 2007 to December 2013.
But the judge also said dismissing UBS was appropriate because there was nothing showing it manipulated prices, even if it benefited from distortions.
""At best, plaintiffs allege that UBS engaged in parallel conduct by offering (along with the fixing members) below-market quotes,"" Caproni said in her 61-page decision.
Caproni gave the investors 14 days to amend their complaint, including against UBS. Briganti said they plan to do so.

Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, increased by 569,000 barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 499.7 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 222,000 barrels, compared to expectations for a gain of 702,000 barrels.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a decline of 2.359 million barrels.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for December delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rose $1.04, or 2.05%, to $51.91 a barrel. London-traded Brent rose to $51.97 earlier, a level not seen since June 10.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 2 percent on Wednesday, hitting their highest since June, on the possibility that the U.S. government will report another weekly drawdown in crude stockpiles.
Speculation about production cuts that could occur at OPEC's meeting next month also kept the market supported.
The American Petroleum Institute (API), a trade group, reported on Tuesday that its data showed U.S. crude inventories dropped 7.6 million barrels during the week ended Sept. 30. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast a build of 2.6 million barrels instead.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will issue official inventory data at 10:30 a.m. (1430 GMT). If the API was correct in calling a draw, it would be a fifth straight weekly decline for U.S. crude stocks. [API/S]
Oil prices ended Tuesday's official session lower before rising post-settlement on the API report.
Brent crude was up 91 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $51.78 a barrel by 9:35 a.m. EDT (1335 GMT) on Wednesday, rising to $51.96 earlier, its highest since June 10.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 95 cents, or 2.1 percent, at $49.64. Its peak for the morning was $49.77, a high since June 29.
""A bullish trading stance over the short term is advised as the upward momentum triggered by last week's OPEC meeting is being sustained by another unexpectedly large crude supply draw,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets advisory Ritterbusch & Associates.
""While the EIA can easily vary appreciably from the API data, it now appears that a sizable crude draw will be forthcoming.""
Oil prices have rallied around 13 percent over the past six sessions after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced plans to limit output when it gathers for its policy meeting in Vienna in November.
OPEC's target is to bring its production to between 32.5 million and 33.0 million barrels per day by cutting some 700,000 bpd from a glut of about 1.0 million-1.5 million bpd estimated by analysts. The group has invited Russia and other major producers to join in making cuts.
Many analysts are skeptical of OPEC's target as the biggest crude producers in the group such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Libya and Nigeria have all been pumping or exporting as much as they could while talking of cuts. Still prices have continued to rise.

""The mere threat of a production cut should put a floor under oil prices until the next OPEC meeting on Nov. 30,"" said Jason Gammel of U.S. investment bank Jefferies.

Natural gas for delivery in November on the New York Mercantile Exchange slumped 2.5 cents, or 0.84%, to $2.939 per million British thermal units by 9:20AM ET (13:20GMT), within sight of a three-week low of $2.866 touched earlier this week.
Market participants awaited weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build of approximately 67 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 30.
That compares with a gain of 49 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 97 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 95 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.600 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2.5% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 6.1% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, traders continued to monitor the path of Hurricane Matthew amid easing concerns that it will disrupt offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico.
Gas futures have made a dramatic recovery in recent months, rising nearly 50% since hitting a 20-year low of $1.611 in early March, as an unusually warm summer helped trim a supply surplus that was weighing on prices.
Despite the recent rally, gains are likely to remain limited as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn having started on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Electric cars such as the Nissan Leaf may look no different from the standard family runaround. But the new materials that go into them could revolutionize the market for metals used in the industry, opening up a new field for commodities investors.
""We identified electric vehicles as an area where we are at an inflection point for demand,"" said Duncan Goodwin, portfolio manager of the Baring Global Resources Fund. 
Around 12 percent of the fund's $378.2 million in assets is exposed to materials that are used in electric vehicles. It has investments in New York-listed Albemarle and Australia's Orocobre, two companies producing lithium, a key element in electric car batteries. Shares in both companies have risen sharply this year.
Governments, keen to push growth in electric cars in a bid to meet their carbon emissions targets, are tempting consumers with perks like subsidies, free parking and tax breaks. Growth in the market is in turn creating an opportunity for commodities investments currently estimated at $235 billion.
But it is not a simple one-way bet. 
Predicting how much of any metal will be needed to meet demand for electric vehicles in the longer term is tough and advances in battery technology could alter the mixture. 
Getting drivers to adopt electric cars remains a challenge - the need to charge them up frequently and time taken to do so have put off many potential buyers.
Still, concerns over the pollution created by diesel-powered vehicles mean that electric car prototypes dominated the Paris car show last week.
The number of electric and hybrid vehicles on the road worldwide surpassed 1 million last year, according to the International Energy Agency. 
While estimates vary, IHS Automotive expects electric vehicles to represent nearly 4 percent of all light vehicles worldwide by 2020, equivalent to 3.9 million cars, up from just over 14,000 in 2010. 
So what sits below the bonnet in these vehicles? 
Most electric car batteries use lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) cathodes and graphite anodes. ""Rare earth"" metals dysprosium, neodymium and terbium, chiefly mined in China by companies including Xiamen Tungsten and China Minmetals Rare Earth Co, are used in some electronic components of the motor. 
""It's clear that electric cars from today's point of view will have lithium ion-based batteries,"" said Horst Friedrich, director of Germany's Institute of Vehicle Concepts. 
""We're talking about lithium, and... metals like cobalt, iron phosphate, rare earth elements."" 
LITHIUM TRIANGLE 
Much of the world's lithium comes from an area called the ""Lithium triangle"" in Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. Mining it is an increasingly lucrative business. 
Prices of battery grade lithium in China, the biggest lithium ion battery producer, surged to above $20,000 a tonne this summer, nearly three times higher than a year earlier, as demand grew. 
""The lithium industry is going from 160,000 tonnes of LCE (lithium carbonate equivalent) today to at least 260,000 tonnes by 2020,"" said Simon Moores, managing director of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. 
Albemarle is investing an undisclosed sum to boost its production of battery-grade lithium salts to try to supply half of that projected demand growth, said John Mitchell, the president of Albemarle's lithium unit. 
Australia's Lithium Power International is preparing its Maricunga Salar project in northern Chile to be able to ship lithium directly to China for use in electric vehicles, and aims to be in production by 2019-2020. 
Australian rival Orocobre, whose share price has risen by more than 50 percent this year, has nearly completed a scoping study with the aim of at least doubling production capacity over the next two years at a facility in Argentina. 
Among South American companies, Chile's SQM announced this month that it was investing $30 million to boost its lithium hydroxide capacity by 7,500 tonnes. 
""The market penetration of electric vehicles in the automotive market will have a significant impact on lithium demand,"" it said. 
""BUYER BEWARE"" 
Critics caution against expecting shortages of lithium as there is an abundance of it in the earth's crust. Others warn against jumping too quickly into smaller companies that may not produce the high grade lithium needed for the batteries.

China dominates the sector for graphite, used in anodes. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence expects 150,000-170,000 tonnes of extra anode grade graphite will be needed by 2020, worth an extra $1.125-1.275 billion. 
Canada's Eagle Graphite said while the impact of electric vehicles on its business is still to be felt, when global production hits around 1 million cars per year, the draw on graphite supplies will become significant. 
""The more forward-looking manufacturers are rightly becoming concerned about long term supply,"" its CEO Jamie Deith said. ""Not only is there the question of producing enough graphite, but the fact that China accounts for 100 percent of natural graphite anodes today is an additional concern."" 
""The battery industry has to diversify sources."" 
Meanwhile cobalt prices, up 16 percent this year, are expected to rise another 45 percent by 2020. The U.S. Defense Logistics Agency starting to stockpile cobalt compounds highlights their importance. 
Sherritt International, one of the largest cobalt producers, said it is set to increase cobalt production at its Ambatovy mine in Madagascar in line with nickel output. 
As cobalt is mined largely as a by-product of other metals such as nickel and copper, it is hard for producers to crank up output in response to higher demand, it said. That lack of supply elasticity could push prices higher. 
Not all metals used in car batteries have a rosy future. Demand for manganese, a common component in steel, is expected to remain weak in the near term as the steel sector suffers. 
""NICE DRIVE"" 
Predicting how much of any given metal would be needed to meet demand for electric vehicles in the longer term is tough and advances in battery technology could alter the amounts. 
Metals such as nickel, cobalt and manganese may not be needed in batteries such as the lithium sulfur battery being developed by Oxis Energy, based in the English city of Oxford. 
Also in the background are green vehicle technologies, most notably hydrogen fuel cells, being mooted as possible rivals to batteries. But developing new technology to the point where it can be commercialized takes time. 
""We consider the risk of substitution of lithium to be very low,"" said CRU Group's Julia Ralph. 
Guiding the silent, top-of-the-range Leaf around a showroom complex at Nissan London West, salesman Keith Almansury says education is the key to driving growth in the segment. 

""If people don't love electric cars, it's because they don't know about electric cars,"" he said, flagging up benefits including environmental friendliness, savings on fuel and servicing, and free parking. ""But above all, it's just a really nice drive.""

MARACAIBO, Venezuela (Reuters) - For decades, jobs at Venezuela's state-run oil giant PDVSA were coveted for above average salaries, generous benefits and cheap credit that brought home ownership and vacationing abroad within reach for many workers.
Now, in Venezuela's asphyxiating economy, even PDVSA employees are struggling to pay for everything from food and bus rides to school fees as triple-digit inflation eats away incomes.
They are pawning goods, maxing out credit cards, taking side jobs, and even selling PDVSA uniforms to buy food, according to Reuters' interviews with two dozen workers, family members, and union leaders. 
""Every day a PDVSA worker comes to sell his overall,"" said Elmer, a hawker at the biggest market in the oil city of Maracaibo, as shoppers eyed pricey rice and flour imported from neighboring Colombia.
""They also sell boots, trousers, gloves and masks.""
The bulk of PDVSA's roughly 150,000 workers make from $35 to $150 a month plus some $90 dollars in food tickets, as calculated at the black market exchange rate. It is still more than many Venezuelans, but not enough, employees say.
""Sometimes we let the kids sleep in until noon to save on breakfast,"" said a maintenance worker who works on the shores of Maracaibo Lake, Venezuela's traditional oil-producing area near the Colombian border. He said he has lost five kilos (11 lb) this year because of scrimping on food. 
The toll of the economic crisis is fueling worker disillusionment, absenteeism, and a brain drain and is hurting efficiency in the industry which produces more than 90 percent of Venezuela's export revenue.
""Most of us aren't as productive as we used to be, because we're more focused on how to survive economically,"" said the maintenance worker, speaking on condition of anonymity as he said he feared reprisals.
That adds to a wide array of problems caused by a cash shortfall - from underinvestment and part shortages to poor maintenance, theft and insufficient imports for blending. 
As a result, the OPEC member's oil output tumbled this year, dealing another blow to the unpopular government of leftist President Nicolas Maduro, already under pressure due to low international oil prices. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2doEN3w)
PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], which did not respond to a request for comment for this story, says its employees are happy and state television regularly shows crowds of cheering PDVSA workers in red overalls. The company talks of a right-wing media campaign to discredit late leader Hugo Chavez's ""21st century Socialism."" 
""While PDVSA does not escape the (oil) price situation, its workforce remains intact and ready to generate initiatives to boost major projects,"" it said recently.
BARTERING TO EAT 
In Ciudad Ojeda, a hot oil town that hugs the shores of Lake Maracaibo, food lines and shuttered shops dot the city of roughly 92,000 and, for the first time, the opposition-led mayor's office is organizing soup kitchens.
A former PDVSA worker, who quit earlier this year because he could earn more driving a taxi, said that over the past months he sold four overalls and one pair of boots to feed his three children. He bartered another pair of boots for meat. He also sold his furniture, including his dining table, to buy food. 
Further north at the massive Paraguana refining center, a mechanic and a father of two, recently offloaded new boots for roughly $7 - ""cheap, so I could sell quickly and get food."" 
Despite their anger, workers say they are scared to protest.
Since Chavez opponents tried to oust him by shutting down the oil industry in a months-long strike that started in 2002, stoppages are considered sabotage.
Oil workers duck out of work to stand in food lines, and people at the Petrocedeno oil upgrader in eastern Venezuela say rowdy company cafeteria queues now start an hour before lunch as workers jostle before food runs out.
Maduro blames these shortages on U.S.-backed businessmen he says are hoarding products to torpedo his government, an argument that still resounds with some workers. 
""The situation is tough because of the 'economic war',"" said PDVSA cook Moraima Reyes in Paraguana. ""That's why we're defending the revolution more than ever."" 
But many speak of leaving PDVSA or Venezuela altogether, joining a brain drain that has seen professionals flock to Colombia, Spain or Panama.
""What's the point of working? It's impossible to have a good quality of life,"" a former automation specialist at PDVSA said in a phone interview. Last year he moved to the United States, where he has to hold several jobs, including in a restaurant and a car dealership.

""I have no regrets. Whatever it takes to escape Venezuela's communism.""

481,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2016 12:40PM ET</span>",OPEC sights set for now on $50-60 per barrel oil: PIRA's Ross,"By Simon Webb
NEW YORK (Reuters) - OPEC producers have their sights set on a sustained oil price of $50-$60 per barrel, a modest ambition for the first cut in supply by the oil exporting group in eight years, says one of the industry's top forecasters.
Benchmark U.S. oil prices (CLc1) have risen around $4, or around nine percent, to over $48 per barrel since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed last week to shave output.
""You don't manage the market unless you have a price in mind,"" said Gary Ross, founder and executive chairman at the New York-based consultancy PIRA.
""They are being cautious, they want to see what will happen with shale. But OPEC's price aspirations only go up over time. They don't go down.""
The deal marks the return to supply caps for the producer group after a brutal two-year free-for-all when OPEC members ditched output targets and pumped more than the market needed in a price war that bloodied U.S. shale producers.
U.S. oil output fell to around 8.7 million barrels per day in July, the lowest since May 2014 and down over 730,000 bpd on the year, mostly as shale producers hit by low oil prices cut output.
Ross challenged the assumption that a higher price could be self-defeating for OPEC because it will encourage shale producers to boost output.
""We're not necessarily about to be overwhelmed by shale oil,"" he said. ""The timing of this is quite deliberate, OPEC is doing this heading into winter and at a time when supply from non-OPEC producers is down.""
Peak northern hemisphere energy demand during the cold season provides OPEC with a window to reach its price aspirations, Ross said. Shale producers will need four to six months to bring new production online, and that may take longer in areas where cold weather prevents work.
After letting thousands of employees go over the past two years, it will take time for shale producers to build up operations and costs will rise quickly, he added.
The impact of fast-rising costs on shale producers was likely another factor in OPEC's thinking, Ross said. OPEC producers have less variable costs and so will benefit more from the uplift in oil prices than shale producers, he said.
While the price rout hurt OPEC's competitors, the group's oil ministers were under pressure from their own central bankers and finance ministers to do something to reverse the impact of low prices on their own revenues, Ross said.
Many have had to cut budgets and the generous benefits as they adjusted to the longest and deepest oil price rout since the 1980s.
The $4 rise in prices is already worth over $100 million a day in additional revenue for OPEC producers pumping around 33 million bpd of crude.
OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia was not just dressing up a seasonal variation in output as a supply cut, Ross said. The kingdom typically reduces output after summer, when it no longer needs to burn crude for power generation to feed demand for air conditioning.
""There is a lot more to it than that,"" he said. ""The policy to push for market share is over. It's a matter now of going back to managing the market.""

482,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2016 07:40AM ET</span>",France launches guarantee fund to help struggling farmers,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will launch a public guarantee system to enable farmers facing a sharp fall in revenue to boost their cash position or refinance their debt at favorable rates, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said on Tuesday.
French livestock, dairy and grain farmers have all faced weak prices in the past year, with grain growers also hit by a slump in output this season due to poor spring weather which led to the lowest yields in over 30 years in some crops.
""In light of this (crisis), we need a mobilisation of all actors concerned,"" Valls told reporters.
The state will guarantee, through public bank Bpifrance, half of farmers' new loans or refinanced ones. The aim is to generate up to 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) of credit to improve rolling funds and cut reimbursement costs.
For those whose gross operating profit is forecast to fall in 2016 by at least 20 percent compared to the average of the past five years, excluding the best and the worst, it will fund the entire public guarantee cost, officials said.
Between 50,000 and 80,000 farmers could benefit from this measure, they said.
""The whole purpose of the state guarantee is to allow everyone to access low rates and favourable refinancing,"" Agriculture Minister Stephane Le Foll told reporters. 
The new fund will be built up gradually, according to actual needs, and the extent of state's financial involvement is thus yet to be determined, officials said.
Xavier Beulin, head of France's largest farm union FNSEA, welcomed the plan.
""It's finally the recognition of a major crisis in the French agriculture,"" he told reporters. 
""We have been facing an economic crisis for two years and this year we also have a weather crisis never seen probably since the post-war,"" he added, pegging losses for the sector at between 4 and 5 billion euros this year.
The government had already put forward a set of ""initial emergency measures"" for grain farmers in late July so that they could start their sowings before the new harvest, including tax rebates and speeding up repayment of value added tax (VAT).
Most of these measures were extended in the latest plan.
France also unblocked nearly 50 million euros for livestock farmers as part of a wider EU plan and slowed down its plan to transfer EU subsidies from large grain farms to smaller livestock ones.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Tuesday on news that Iran and Libya have continued to increase production, overshadowing an OPEC agreement struck last week to freeze output levels in a bid to stem a two-year price rout.
Benchmark Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) were trading down 22 cents at $50.67 a barrel at 1027 GMT.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) was down 24 cents at $48.57 a barrel.
""Today's losses should come as no surprise as Libyan production is climbing higher and Iranian exports are on the rise too. Add to these that the dollar is strengthening and you have a bearish cocktail,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates in London.
Iran's crude oil and condensate sales have likely approached levels last seen at peak time in 2011 before western sanctions were imposed, sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Iran, which is allowed to produce ""maximum levels that make sense"" as part of an output limit agreed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last week, likely sold 2.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude and condensate in September, the sources said.
In a further sign it plans to lift output, Iran on Tuesday signed its first new style contract with a domestic company to upgrade two of its oil fields.
Iran wants to regain its pre-sanctions production level of 4 million bpd.
At the same time, production is also rising in Libya, which is also exempt from an output freeze. The country's Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO) said its production had risen to 320,000 bpd, up from about 290,000 bpd late last week, helping to push the country's production above 500,000 bpd.
Oil prices also took a knock from a stronger dollar (DXY), which reached a 13-day high against a basket of major currencies after a positive U.S. economic survey increased investors' confidence in a rise in U.S. interest rates by the end of the year. (FRX)
Oil investors are also keenly awaiting the latest U.S. commercial crude oil stocks data, which has surprised the market over the past four weeks with unexpected drawdowns.
A Reuters poll showed analysts expect a 2.7 million-barrel rise in stocks in the week ending Sept. 30, a trend which would be bearish for prices. [EIA/S]

485,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2016 03:37AM ET</span>",Italian olive grove stands in way of European energy security,"By Giancarlo Navach and Stephen Jewkes
MELENDUGNO, Italy (Reuters) - In the name of European energy security, a private guard wearing a navy blue uniform, aviator sunglasses and a baseball cap walks around a grove of olive trees in southern Italy.
The 231 trees, surrounded by dry-stone walls on a dusty plain near the Adriatic coast, stand in the way of a $45 billion pipeline designed to bring gas from central Asia and help wean the European Union off its dependence on Russian energy.
Local authorities want the pipeline re-routed away from the prized grove, which includes trees thought to be more than 400 years old, but developers have Rome's approval to proceed, on condition they are transplanted while pipes are laid and buried.
Wary of protests, the pipeline consortium, which includes Britain's  BP  (L:BP), Azeri state energy company SOCAR and Italian gas company Snam (MI:SRG), has hired 24-hour security.
In reality, work on the Italian side of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) cannot proceed without local consent, threatening to delay a project that is meant within four years to carry the equivalent of 10 percent of Europe's Russian energy imports.
The olive grove, whose oldest trees are recognized as part of the world heritage by UNESCO, represents more than a weak link in European energy security.
It also highlights an issue at the heart of Italy's biggest constitutional reform debate in a decade: the power of local authorities to thwart Rome. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi proposes to dilute that power in a Dec. 4 referendum.
""None of the regions are happy with this reform because they fear they will be weaker in the face of the central government and will have to suffer things they don't understand, like TAP,"" said Michele Emiliano, the regional governor of Puglia, Italy's biggest olive oil producer and a popular tourist spot.
Italy's economic development minister has previously accused Puglia's government of using the grove near the town of Melendugno, and thousands of other trees further along the path of the pipeline, as an excuse to block the project.
""If it passes the referendum will ensure a more sensible division of powers, especially in the energy sector,"" the minister, Carlo Calenda, told Reuters in an email.
The TAP consortium, which also includes Belgium’s Fluxys (BR:FLUX), Spain's  Enagas  (MC:ENAG) and Switzerland’s Axpo, says it has asked Rome to work with Puglia to finalize tree removal and is confident the issue can be resolved soon.
""Even if the go-ahead is delayed it would only mean a narrowing of the time frame for moving the trees, not a stop to the project,"" said TAP's country manager for Italy, Michele Mario Elia.
FEW SIGNS OF LIFE
There were few signs of life when Reuters visited the olive grove outside Melendugno just over a week ago. Apart from the security patrols, there were some fenced-off areas where archaeologists are required to make preliminary excavations, to check for any buried antiquities before the pipeline work can begin.
""There is a risk that some olive trees won't survive,"" said Melendugno mayor Marco Poti, explaining that transplanting them could expose them to xylella, a bacteria that has wiped out tens of thousands of trees in recent years.
In approving the project last year, Rome imposed dozens of conditions, including one requiring a total of about 10,000 olive trees to be carefully removed to allow a trench to be dug for the pipeline. Later, they are to be returned and replanted.
Puglia is threatening to go to the constitutional court if the project goes ahead without its consent, arguing Rome never properly consulted the region. Puglia points to a recent court ruling stipulating that the central government should consult the regions before approving international pipeline projects.
Rome says it fully consulted Puglia before giving TAP the go-ahead.
Olive trees can stir deep passions in Puglia where they blanket the countryside and form part of the region's identity. Plans to destroy some infected trees last year had to be scrapped when protesters climbed them and took to the streets.
""I presume the same thing will happen this time round,"" mayor Poti said.
Local regulations say the developers have from Nov. 1 to April 30 to move the trees in their slow-growth period but full clearance to do so has still not been granted.
If that window shuts, they cannot begin until November 2017.
The 878-km (546 miles) TAP project will run from the Turkish-Greek border and carry gas across Greece, Albania and the Adriatic Sea to the small Italian beach of San Foca. 
It is the last stage of the so-called Southern Gas Corridor that is meant to pump 10 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas each year, expandable to 20 bcm, from Azerbaijan’s giant Shah Deniz II field into European markets.
For Brussels, it is a way of diversifying away from Russia, the EU's top energy supplier. Italy imports about 90 percent of its energy and hopes the TAP pipeline will enable it to become a gas hub for southern Europe. Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, declined comment on the dispute.
BUILDING SANDCASTLES
In Melendugno's sleepy town square, views are split. Some believe the investment will breathe new life into the area and others fear it will threaten the region's tourism.
""The town is divided but the majority doesn't want the pipeline,"" said 72-year-old pensioner Pantaleo, standing beneath a tree in the square, chatting to friends. 
Another local concern is that the pipeline will make landfall at the popular Puglia beach of San Foca, on the Salento coast, famous for its sparkling blue waters. TAP plans to bury the pipe about 10 meters below the beach.
""Would you bring your little girl to build sandcastles over a pipeline with a pressure of 145 bars?"" mayor Poti says.
But the developers say gas pipelines have been built beneath eight other top Italian beaches without any impact on tourism. ""Spain’s Enagas has also recently built a gas pipeline under the famous Cala Gracio beach at Ibiza and there's been no impact on tourism at all,"" said TAP's Elia.
As part of the project, an underground concrete tunnel will extend 700 meters inland and 800 meters out to sea where general contractor  Saipem  (MI:SPMI) will join it to the undersea pipeline laid out under the Adriatic. Saipem has agreed to pull the pipe through the tunnel in winter when few tourists are around.
On the other side, gas grid company Snam (MI:SRG) will build a 55 km pipeline to link TAP to the national grid.
Puglia's governor, Emiliano, wants the pipeline to land further north at the city of Brindisi where he says it could connect directly to Snam's existing gas network. ""Neither the government nor TAP has explained to us why it has to arrive so far south,"" he says. But TAP executive Elia says studies showed the Brindisi option to be unfeasible. The central government insists local authorities were involved throughout the permit process.
TAP developers secured government clearance for the pipeline on May 20 last year. But Renzi's government attached 66 demands - some of which can only be fulfilled with the cooperation of local authorities. The clock is ticking.
As an incentive to speed up work, Brussels offered to exempt the TAP developers from an anti-trust rule if they started work by May 16 this year at the latest and finish within four years. The rule would require TAP to allow rivals to use the pipeline.
TAP - which has cordoned off the Melendugno site, swept for unexploded war bombs and checked for archaeological relics - says it officially started work on May 16.
Rome had also set May 16 as a deadline for the start of project work. But regional governor Emiliano says construction work has not begun and has asked the central government to restart the approvals process from the beginning.

""We believe they have to start everything all over again,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose more than 1 percent on Monday, with Brent settling above $50 a barrel the first time since August and U.S. crude hitting three-month highs, after Iran exhorted the need for other oil producers to join OPEC in supporting the market.
The dollar's retreat from session highs also enticed more buyers into oil as greenback-denominated crude became less costly to holders of other currencies. [FRX/]
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolás Maduro in a telephone conversation that it was essential for oil producing countries to take a decision to raise the price of oil and stabilize the market, Tehran state news agency IRNA reported.
Rouhani's remarks added to the bullish fervor in the market since Wednesday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced its first planned output cut in eight years. [nL8N1C42M9]
Brent settled up 70 cents, or 1.4 percent, at $50.89 a barrel. It was its first close above the key $50 mark since Aug. 19. Brent earlier reached a session peak of $51.14.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude closed up 57 cents, or 1.2 percent, at $48.81. Prior to settlement, it hit $49.02, its highest since July 5.
Iran's call to non-OPEC members helped the market to rally ""because there are many who want to believe this deal will get done,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at the Price Futures Group brokerage in Chicago.
""There's already a soft commitment from Russia that it will be part of the OPEC plan and if more non-OPEC members get on board, prices can only go higher,"" Flynn added.
Oil prices rose about 7 percent in September, ending up a second straight month, after OPEC unveiled plans to reduce output to between 32.5 million and 33.0 million barrels per day. 
How much oil each country will produce is to be decided at the next formal OPEC meeting in November, when an invitation to join cuts could also be extended to non-OPEC countries such as Russia. 
OPEC's oil output likely reached 33.6 million bpd in September from a revised 33.5 million bpd in August, its highest in recent history, a Reuters survey found on Friday.
OPEC member Iran, the No. 4 crude exporter, will sign on Tuesday a new petroleum contract that would be cornerstone to raising its crude output to the pre-sanction levels of 4 million bpd.

""Naysayers will undoubtedly fade the headline (of the output cut) and deem the agreement typical OPEC noise, yet at a minimum it means that OPEC has bought themselves a price floor for at least the next two months heading into the November meeting,"" analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note.

491,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2016 09:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. helped clinch Iraq oil deal to keep Mosul battle on track,"By Stephen Kalin and Dmitry Zhdannikov
BAGHDAD/LONDON (Reuters) - - Shuttle diplomacy by the United States' envoy to the anti-Islamic State coalition brokered an oil deal between Iraq and its Kurdish region vital to a climactic battle with the jihadists, diplomats, officials and oil men say. 
The oil revenue-sharing deal sealed in August was critical to getting the central and regional governments to coordinate planning for a push on the Islamic State stronghold Mosul, which Kurdish peshmerga forces surround on three sides, as soon as this month, the sources said.
Brett McGurk shuttled from Iraqi Kurdistan capital Erbil to Baghdad and back again from the first half of April, culminating in a June 19 meeting in Erbil with Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) leader Massoud Barzani and Iraqi National Security Advisor Falah Fayad.
Barzani ""met McGurk and said, 'We cannot afford Mosul. We need oil and revenues back,"" said a high level source close to the Kurds. ""If it wasn't for McGurk, this deal would have never happened.""
The Kurdish region is home to Iraq's major northern oilfields but a quarrel over who benefits from export revenues has become a prolonged, tangled and emotive dispute.
In early 2014 Baghdad slashed funds to the KRG, which then began exporting oil independently via a pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.
In March Iraq's state-run North Oil Company (NOC) stopped pumping crude through the pipeline from fields it operates in Kirkuk, which the KRG has controlled since Iraqi security forces disintegrated two years ago when Islamic State overran a third of the country.
The move cut Kurdish oil revenues by around a quarter, worsening the budget crisis in Erbil amid low oil prices and the fight against the jihadists. 
Iraq and the U.S.-led military coalition backing it are relying on cooperation from the Kurds to retake Mosul from the ultra-hardline jihadists and undermine their self-proclaimed caliphate.
For Washington, defeating Islamic state has been one of the major foreign policy objectives under the second term of president Barack Obama, who will step down as president in January. 
The deal to restore the flows of Kirkuk crude progressed in August, when public statements show McGurk visited Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in Baghdad on Aug. 11 and two days later met again with Barzani and Fayad in Erbil.
According to sources in Erbil, the KRG told McGurk and Baghdad they had lost around $1 billion dollars in revenues since March as the Kirkuk field was reinjecting around 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) back under the ground instead of exporting it with other Kurdish production of around 450,000 bpd to world markets via Turkey. 
That pushed all sides to iron out a final agreement that was announced following an Aug. 29 meeting in Baghdad between Abadi, McGurk and Barzani.
INTENSE LOBBYING
Under the agreement, up to 150,000 bpd of oil are being exported through Ceyhan as a 50/50 split between the KRG and Baghdad.
It also averted deeper division in Kurdistan itself. Local authorities governing Kirkuk from the city of Sulaimaniyah were asking to ship oil to Iran instead of Turkey, which the governments in Erbil, Baghdad and Washington rejected. 
The breakthrough helped start a separate conversation about the disposition of forces for the push on Mosul and the disputed internal boundaries between central Iraq and the Kurdistan region, said a senior Western diplomat in Baghdad.
""Take that sand out of the gears and turn the oil into oil in the gears ... and then they can have those other conversations about who's going where"" on the battlefield, said the diplomat, who declined to be identified speaking about private discussions.
Since the Kirkuk oil deal was sealed, the Kurds have pledged in private to keep the peshmerga out of Mosul proper while allowing the Iraqis to use territory they currently control around the city to stage troops for the offensive, senior Western diplomats told Reuters, allowing war planning to accelerate.
The military now looks set to push into Mosul by the end of October, which looked improbable just a few months ago. Kurdish leader Barzani visited Baghdad last week for the first time in more than three years, a sign of improving relations.
A lawyer by training, McGurk has been involved in some of Iraq's thorniest disputes since a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. As an adviser to the occupation authorities, he helped draft an interim constitution and oversee the legal transition to an interim Iraqi government.
He advocated the U.S. troop ""surge"" that is partially credited with stemming Iraq's sectarian violence from its 2006-2007 heights. When Islamic State swept through a third of the country in mid-2014, he played a leading role in bringing Prime Minister Abadi into office to address the threat.
McGurk, who could not be reached for comment, has been sprinting around the world for the past year to implement the Obama administration's policy to defeat the jihadists, which includes holding together an Iraq that some observers say is more divided than ever.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, asked about the oil deal, said: ""We give the Iraqi government all of the credit on the agreement.""
Asked about the matter it last month during a trip to Baghdad, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken said he was ""encouraged by the efforts that have been made in recent weeks."" He subsequently visited Erbil.

A spokesman for Abadi said the United States and the international community had played ""an undeniable role"" in encouraging dialogue between Baghdad and Erbil on Kirkuk exports, which built up confidence and helped advance other issues. A KRG spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.

493,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2016 05:49AM ET</span>",Desperate uranium miners switch to survival mode despite nuclear rebound,"By Geert De Clercq
LONDON (Reuters) - The nuclear industry is gradually recovering from its post-Fukushima slump, but excess capacity keeps uranium prices at record lows, forcing mining companies to mothball mines, slice costs and cut debt as they struggle to survive. 
In the wake of the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, Japan closed its nuclear reactors, which accounted for some ten percent of the more than 400 reactors operating globally.
Several other countries including Germany announced plans to exit nuclear, and in the past three years several nuclear reactors in the United States were closed as they could no longer compete with cheap shale gas. 
Five years later, only three of Japan's 42 reactors are back in operation but new reactors brought online in China and other countries have partly made up for the Japanese closures. 
In the next few years, eight Westinghouse reactors are expected to open in the United States and China, four Areva reactors in Finland, France and China, and four Kepco-built reactors in United Arab Emirates.
The World Nuclear Association (WNA) says it is feasible that global nuclear electricity production, at around 2,441 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2015, may return to 2011 levels this year and to pre-Fukushima levels in two-three years. In 2010, the last full year before Fukushima, nuclear generation came to 2,630 TWh.
Long-term perspectives have picked up too.
China plans to build at least 60 nuclear plants in the coming decade, South Africa last month kicked off a major nuclear tender, and Thursday's signature of the Hinkley Point contract between French utility EDF (PA:EDF) and the UK government opens the way for up to 12 new reactors in Britain. 
As nuclear reactors need fuel, all this should be good news for uranium miners, but the radioactive metal last week hit a new decade low of $23.5 per pound. 
Uranium, which before the 2008 financial crisis had briefly peaked around $140 per pound in June 2007, traded around $70 per pound just before the Fukushima disaster and has been on a downward trend ever since.
""It has never been a worse time for uranium miners, although globally the nuclear industry does well,"" Alexander Molyneux, CEO of Australian uranium miner Paladin Energy told Reuters in an interview.
BULGING INVENTORIES
Mining executives partly blame the slump on their customers' wait-and-see attitude, as utilities believe that the uranium market's over-capacity will persist for years and see no need to rebuild their dwindling stockpiles. 
Demand for uranium is determined by the number of nuclear plants in operation worldwide, but supply and demand are disjointed by huge stocks and uranium's long production cycle.
In coal, a bulky and inexpensive commodity, there is relatively little inventory on the planet, as it typically takes six to eight weeks between mining it and burning it.
Uranium however has to be mined, converted, enriched and turned into fuel rods in an 18 to 24 month process. And as security of supply is so important and uranium makes up just a few percentage points of the cost of running nuclear reactor, utilities tend to have 5-7 years' worth of inventory. 
""At the moment, nobody feels the need to buy and the price is lower every day. We are still waiting for the inflexion point,"" Molyneux said.
In the five years before Fukushima, utilities worldwide bought about 200 million pounds of uranium per year, he said. Although Japan's consumption averaged only around 25 million pounds per year, when it closed its reactors demand was cut far further, falling by half. European and U.S. utilities saw that the market was over-supplied and reduced inventories, buying less.
Mining firm Energy Fuels estimates global uranium stocks held by utilities, miners and governments are now at around 1 billion pounds. That is down from a peak around 2.5 billion pounds in 1990, but still many years' worth of consumption.
Despite the plunge in uranium prices after the 2008 financial crisis and again after Fukushima, uranium production has doubled from 80-90 million pounds in the mid-1990s to about 160 million pounds last year, according to Energy Fuels data. 
Most of that new supply came from Kazakhstan, which over the past decade has more than quintupled its output to become the world's leading source of uranium with a 38 percent market share in 2013, WNA data show. 
DESPERATE TIMES
With so much new supply, and demand sliding, prices have fallen to a level where most uranium miners operate at a loss. 
""At today's spot prices, the primary uranium mining industry is not sustainable,"" US uranium producer Energy Fuels COO Mark Chalmers told the World Nuclear Association's London conference last month. 
He added that many legacy long-term supply contracts will expire in 2017-18, which will force many mines to close or throttle back even further than they already have. 
Miners like Canada's Cameco, France's Areva and the uranium arms of global mining companies have closed or mothballed several mines and deferred new projects in order to cut back supply.
Paladin - the world's second-largest independent pure-play uranium miner after Cameco and the seventh or eighth-largest globally - has production capacity of 8 million pounds of yellowcake uranium but produced just 4.9 million pounds last year at its Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia.
Molyneux said the firm will produce about 4 million pounds this year and will cut output further to about 3.5 million pounds next year if prices do not recover.
Paladin suspended production at its 2.3 million pounds per year capacity Kayelekera mine in northern Malawi in 2014 but maintains equipment so it can resume when prices recover.
Meanwhile it is trying to further reduce its debt, which already fell from $1.2 billion five years ago to $362 million. 
Paladin has agreed to sell 24 pct of Langer Heinrich to the China National Nuclear Company and plans to use the expected proceeds of 175 million dollars to further reduce debt.
Bigger peer Cameco in April suspended production at its Rabbit Lake, Canada mine while also curtailing output across its U.S. operations, saying market conditions could not support the operating and capital costs needed to sustain production.
Cameco marketing head Tim Gabruch told the WNA conference that ""desperate times call for desperate measures"".
Supply adjustments and producer discipline had not yet been sufficient to counter the loss of demand, he said.

""As difficult as those decisions have been, we recognize that those actions may not be enough.""

499,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2016 04:22PM ET</span>","Russia, bowing to budget pressures, revives oil firm sell-off","By Darya Korsunskaya
SOCHI, Russia (Reuters) - Russia said on Friday that it was resuming the shelved privatisation of oil firm Bashneft, in a sign of how anxious the Kremlin is to raise money to fill holes in the budget left by the economic slump.
The Bashneft privatisation, the most significant sell-off of Russian state assets in years, had been postponed indefinitely in August.
Sources close to the government and the bidding process said at the time the postponement was ordered by the Kremlin to staunch infighting among rival clans over who would be the eventual buyer.
But in a U-turn, Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said on Friday steps to resume the privatisation would be taken immediately.
He said that Rosneft - the state oil giant whose ambition to acquire Bashneft triggered the infighting - would be free to take part. A spokesman for Rosneft said the company would be lodging a bid.
Shuvalov also said the government would proceed immediately with the sale of a minority stake in Rosneft itself, an acquisition of potential interest to international oil majors who covet a share in Russia's massive crude reserves.
""Money is needed urgently,"" a source in the government said, when asked what brought about the government's U-turn on its privatisation plans.
A second source in the government said: ""The sale of Bashneft to Rosneft is a done deal.""
BUDGET HOLES
Russia is in its second year of economic recession, mainly because of the fall in world prices for crude oil, its principal export. It expects only very moderate growth next year, 
The government has struggled to find funds to cover its growing budget deficit. The finance ministry said on Friday the deficit may hit between 3.5 percent and 3.7 percent of gross domestic product this year, compared to a 3 percent estimate a few months ago.
Russia's sovereign wealth funds are depleting fast, and its ability to raise debt on international capital markets is limited by financial sanctions imposed on Moscow over its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
The government has little scope to cut spending. That could alienate ordinary people whose support President Vladimir Putin will need if, as expected, he seeks re-election in a presidential election in 18 months.
""After further study of the Rosneft and Bashneft privatisation issues by the government, and after a presentation to the president, it was decided to resume the preparations for selling a controlling stake in Bashneft and immediately proceed to prepare for selling a 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft,"" Shuvalov said.
Speaking to reporters at a business forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, he said the government had reconsidered its position after seeing investor appetite for the two stakes and learning what the potential bidders planned to do if they won.
""According to the assurances that we have received from investment consultants, we hope to receive above 1 trillion roubles ($15.92 billion) from these deals by the end of the current year,"" Shuvalov said.
""The money from the Rosneft privatisation will be counted as budget revenue, and the revenue from the sale of Bashneft (will go on) covering the federal budget deficit,"" he said.
On the Bashneft sale, Shuvalov said: ""Rosneft will not be prevented from participating.""
PUTIN'S CHOICE
Two years into an economic crisis made worse by the Kremlin's political stand-off with the West, Putin faces a difficult choice.
He needs to find ways to plug the holes in the budget and put money into the pocket-books of ordinary Russians who have seen their incomes drop in real terms. But the prescriptions for achieving that goal could also unleash conflict within his own entourage, potentially destabilising his rule.
The plan to sell a 50.8 stake in Bashneft had attracted interest from Rosneft, a company headed by Putin's long-standing associate Igor Sechin, and Lukoil, Russia's biggest privately-owned oil company run by billionaire Vagit Alekperov.
The interest from Rosneft provoked a storm of protests from pro-market groups within the Kremlin elite who did not see the benefit of one state-owned company acquiring another, according to the sources close to the government and the privatisation process.
But in an interview earlier this month, Putin signalled he did not see a problem with Rosneft bidding.
""It looks like Rosneft convinced the government that it is the most suitable suitor to buy Rosneft,"" said Sergei Vakhrameyev, analyst with GL Asset Management.
Shuvalov said there has been substantial interest in both the Bashneft and Rosneft sell-offs.
He said Bashneft has attracted interest primarily from Russian investors.
The planned sale of the 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft, by contrast, was garnering interest mainly from foreign investors, Shuvalov said.

500,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2016 01:58PM ET</span>","OPEC oil output hits record on Iraq, Libya boost: Reuters survey","By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC's oil output is likely to reach its highest in recent history in September, a Reuters survey found on Friday, as Iraq boosted northern exports and Libya reopened some of its main oil terminals. 
The increase comes despite lower output in top exporter Saudi Arabia and this week's agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Algeria to limit supply to support prices, its first such decision since 2008.
Supply from OPEC has risen to 33.60 million barrels per day (bpd) in September from a revised 33.53 million bpd in August, according to the survey based on shipping data and information from industry sources.
The rise in output could add to scepticism about OPEC's ability to allocate its new production target of between 32.50 million and 33 million bpd, a task ministers left until a meeting in November. Oil rallied towards $50 a barrel on Thursday but was trading near $49 on Friday.
""The agreement still leaves hard and difficult negotiations for the individual caps to be set,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB. 
""Now, with an OPEC curb on the cards for the first time in eight years, Brent crude is not even able to lift above $50. At least not yet.""
Supply has risen since OPEC in 2014 dropped its historic role of fixing output to prop up prices as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran pumped more. Production has also climbed due to the return of Indonesia in 2015 and Gabon in July as members. 
The membership changes have skewed historical comparisons. September's supply from OPEC excluding Gabon and Indonesia, at 32.65 million bpd, is the highest in Reuters survey records starting in 1997.
In September, the increase was led by Iraq and Libya. Iraqi state oil firm SOMO and Iraq's semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan began jointly exporting crude from the Kirkuk oilfield again. This lifted Iraqi supply to market to 4.43 million bpd in September, according to the survey.
In Libya, the National Oil Corporation opened three previously blockaded ports, allowing AGOCO, an NOC subsidiary that operates mainly in eastern Libya, to boost output. [L8N1C54J2]
Supply in Saudi Arabia has edged down from the record high reached earlier in the summer, sources in the survey said.
Supply in Iran, OPEC's fastest source of production growth earlier this year after the lifting of Western sanctions, has held steady this month as output nears the pre-sanctions rate. Iran is seeking investment to boost supply further.
Angolan output slipped because the Plutonio field was shut for part of the month.
There was no sign yet of higher supply from Nigeria, where attacks on oil installations have cut output. Supply should rise in October if efforts for a restart of Qua Iboe and Forcados crude exports come to fruition.

The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data, and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

501,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2016 10:52AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China set to export corn, posing new threat to battered global market - sources","By Dominique Patton
BEIJING (Reuters) - China has given approval to at least two companies to export corn, trading sources said, in a radical move by the world's No. 2 producer to cut its ballooning surplus and unleash more supply into a saturated global market.
In what could be the first bulk exports in a decade, the Chinese government has issued permits to two state-owned companies, top grains trader Cofco and major processor and trader Beidahuang, allowing them to sell grain abroad, the China-based sources who were not authorized to speak to the media said on Friday.
The greenlight was for around 2 million tonnes of corn to be exported by three state-owned companies, said one of the trading sources who had spoken to one of the exporters. A second source had spoken to a foreign company which is in discussions with one of the approved exporters.
A spokesperson for China's commerce ministry said the permits were not its responsibility and directed questions to the state planer, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).
The NDRC did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for COFCO did not answer his phone. A person reached at Beidahuang declined to comment. 
Traders and analysts said exports have been increasingly likely as China struggles with a massive grain surplus and prepares to harvest a bumper crop, its first in almost a decade without government price support.
Chinese corn prices  have slumped more than 20 percent in the past year and are expected to fall further towards international benchmarks.
Even if quantities are limited at first, sales abroad would spook major exporters such as Brazil and the United States, increasing competition at a time when record harvests are predicted in many regions. Five of the top ten largest corn importers are in Asia, which may allow China to compete against the Americans and others with lower freight costs. 
The potential sales would also come amid an intensifying spat between China and the United States over trade in everything from grains to aluminum.
China last exported significant volumes of corn in 2006/07, when it sold almost 5 million tonnes. It has since become a major importer after a state stockpiling scheme pushed domestic prices way above the global market, stoking purchases of cheaper grain from overseas. 
The policy has left a corn stockpile estimated at nearly 240 million tonnes - much of it poor quality due to its age - which Beijing is now struggling to offload after abandoning the program this year. 
On top of that, China's crop of nearly 220 million tonnes is set to hit the market next month.
TESTING APPETITE
A Singapore-based trader told Reuters he had recently been approached by a Chinese exporter testing appetite for corn in neighboring markets.
""To attract buyers they will have to offer lower prices than what they are getting from the Black Sea region and South America,"" said another trader in Singapore.
It would be logical for China to sound out interest in big corn consuming countries nearby like South Korea, which has been in the market this week and paid as little as $183 a ton for January delivery.
Chinese corn prices this week stood at around 1,400 yuan ($210) a ton, down from about 1,650 yuan in mid-June.
But many expect prices to fall further as the harvesting gathers momentum next month. 
""It is just a matter of time (until exports start) as prices are quite competitive,"" said a Singapore-based trading manager with an international agribusiness.
The government is also considering offering tax rebates of 13 percent to help make corn exports more competitive, said consultancy Shanghai JC Intelligence Co on its website without saying where the information came from.

Other analysts and traders warned however that detection of unapproved strains of genetically modified corn in the Chinese crop recently could create a barrier to exports to some countries.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell as the dollar strengthened on Friday and investors cashed in on crude's 6 percent one-day rise after OPEC members agreed on output cuts for the first time in eight years to stifle a two-year price slide.
Global benchmark Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were down 33 cents at $48.91 a barrel by 1350 GMT, but still around 6 percent higher than before Wednesday's OPEC agreement.
U.S. crude (CLc1) was down 6 cents at $47.77 a barrel, also about 6 percent higher than before the OPEC deal.
The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies, making it more expensive for investors to hold dollar-denominated commodities such as oil.
""We're seeing some profit-taking because it is a long time until the next OPEC meeting in November when individual quotas have to follow,"" said Frank Klumpp, oil analyst at Stuttgart-based Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had agreed to cut output to 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day (bpd) from about 33.5 million bpd, estimated by Reuters to be August's production level.
The details, including the quotas for each member and the implementation data, will be finalised at OPEC's policy meeting in November.
""The group surprised us in Algiers and we cannot rule out that they will surprise us again,"" BMI Research analysts said.
""However, we maintain our view that a collective cut will have little impact on a fundamental level.""
A persistent oil supply glut brought prices from mid-2014 highs above $100 a barrel to less than $50 today, prompting the oil producers' group to find agreement on limiting output.
Russia, not an OPEC member but a large producer currently pumping crude at record high levels, said it would find a way to freeze production if the country reaches an agreement with OPEC members. 
The United States, a non-OPEC country that is now the world's biggest oil producer, said it had little faith in this week's deal leading to higher prices in the long term. 
Amos Hochstein, the U.S. energy envoy, said in a Reuters interview that the deal will either lead to higher U.S. production and trigger another price fall or allow U.S. producers to expand market share.
Investors are bracing for further oil price swings ahead of the November meeting.
""We are likely to see some volatility going into November's meeting,"" said Jade Fu, investment manager at Heartwood Investment Management.

""We continue to maintain reasonable exposure to energy through commodity-related sectors, such as U.S. high yield and private equity.""

KUALA LUMPUR/MILAN (Reuters) - Malaysian state oil firm Petroliam Nasional Bhd is considering selling its majority stake in a $27 billion Canadian liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, three people familiar with the matter said this week.
Petronas, as the company is known, is weighing options for the project as a more than 50 percent slide in crude oil prices since the middle of 2014 has hit the group's profits and prompted cuts to capital expenditure and jobs.
Amid the cost-cutting, the economics of the Canadian project - which took three years to get approval due to environment concerns - have been called into question as LNG prices have fallen more than 70 percent in two years. 
Petronas was given the go-ahead for the C$36 billion ($27.34 billion) project by the Canadian government earlier this week. It said then that executives would study the 190 conditions imposed by the authorities and conduct a review before deciding on the next steps.
Petronas said on Friday it will not provide any additional comment when asked about the potential sale. 
The sources said Petronas has been considering a sale for months, after it became apparent that a Canadian approval was possible, but had yet to take a final decision. Other options are also being considered, including putting it on ice.
""They are going to be looking at gas prices, costs and returns before they make the final decision,"" said one of the sources. ""It is a very tough call.""
The Canadian project is Petronas' biggest foreign investment and seen as a sign of Malaysia's global energy ambitions. An exit would underscore the financial constraints at the state-run firm and also the soft outlook for LNG prices. 
Last month, Petronas reported an 85 percent slide in second-quarter profit and labeled the industry outlook ""gloomy"" well into 2017. It has committed to paying 16 billion ringgit to the government coffers this year, down nearly 40 percent from its year-ago contribution.
TOUGH SELL
Petronas signed on for the project in 2012 through the acquisition of Canada's Progress Energy. 
It has faced several hurdles. Aboriginal and environmental groups have said the project would threaten a salmon habitat. The LNG price decline added to concerns, also a growing supply glut as other projects went live. 
If Petronas goes ahead with a sale, finding a buyer in current market conditions would be difficult, the sources said.
Petronas was considering its options as far back as a year ago, a separate industry source said, but he added it would be difficult to sell in the current environment given that Canadian projects are more expensive. 
If Petronas opts to suspend the Canada project, it would be put on ice until gas prices begin to turn around and Petronas is confident of securing long-term contracts at reasonable prices, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the negotiations are not public. 
Other LNG projects in British Columbia have also faced delays, underlining the market outlook. In July, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and its partners pushed back a decision on building an LNG export terminal, and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) has delayed the scheduled 2017 start of its Kitimat LNG project. 
Petronas has minority partners for the project in China, India, Japan and Brunei.

It was the first such deal since 2008.

OPEC said other details of the plan will be known at its policy meeting in November, leaving unanswered when the agreement will come into effect, what new quotas for member countries will be and for what periods, and how compliance will be verified.
Earlier in the day, oil was down, with crude futures retreating from their 6-percent gain on Wednesday, the biggest in a day since April. A steady dollar and weak U.S. stock market also limited some of the upside in oil in early trading. [USD/] (N)

""If this proposed cut is strictly enforced and supports prices, we would expect it to prove self defeating medium-term with a large drilling response around the world,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note, citing a 1987 OPEC cut that led to surge in worldwide oil rigs.
The OPEC plan will remove around 700,000 bpd, but the global crude oversupply is estimated at between 1.0-1.5 million bpd, analysts said. 

Goldman said prices could rise $7-10 per barrel by first-half 2017 if the cuts were honored. ""We reiterate our year-end $43 and 2017 $53 forecasts,"" it added.

513,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 29, 2016 10:33AM ET</span>",U.S. natural gas turns higher after bullish weekly storage data,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures revered losses on Thursday morning, turning higher after data showed that natural gas supplies in storage in the U.S. rose less than expected last week.
Natural gas for delivery in November on the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up 0.8 cents, or 0.27%, to trade at $3.013 per million British thermal units by 10:34AM ET (14:34GMT). Futures were at around $2.962 prior to the release of the supply data.
On Wednesday, futures dropped to $2.944, a level not seen since September 15.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 49 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 23, below expectations for an increase of 55 billion cubic feet.
That compared with a gain of 52 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 96 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 97 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.600 trillion cubic feet, 2.5% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 6.1% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Gas futures have made a dramatic recovery in recent months, rising nearly 50% since hitting a 20-year low of $1.611 in early March, as an unusually warm summer helped trim a supply surplus that was weighing on prices.
Despite the recent rally, gains are likely to remain limited as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn having started on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.

Crude soared on Wednesday after OPEC members surprised the market by agreeing to cut oil output in the first such deal since 2008 in talks held on the sidelines of an energy conference in Algeria. The 14-member bloc, however, deferred the task of finalizing a plan to make those cuts until November.
Brent oil for December delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 15 cents, or 0.3%, to $49.09 a barrel by 9:40AM ET (13:40GMT). The contract rose to $49.65 earlier, the most since September 9.
On Wednesday, London-traded Brent futures jumped $2.72, or 5.85%, after OPEC reached an agreement to limit production to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day, a reduction of 0.7%-to-2.2% from its current output of 33.2 million barrels.
However, the market remained skeptical of the deal, pondering how such a plan would be implemented. Some analysts cautioned that the agreement left out crucial details on how much each country will produce.
The 14-member oil group said it will wait until the official OPEC meeting in Vienna on November 30 to finalize the decision, when an invitation to join cuts could also be extended to non-OPEC countries such as Russia.
Elsewhere, crude oil for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up 5 cents, or 0.11%, to $47.10 a barrel, after rallying $2.38, or 5.33%, a day earlier.
Weekly government supply data released on Wednesday showed that crude stockpiles in the U.S. fell for the fourth week in a row. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude oil inventories declined by 1.9 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 3.0 million barrels.
However, the data also revealed a large build in gasoline inventories, which rose 2.0 million barrels, far more than the gain of 178,000 barrels forecast by analysts.

There is also an appearance by Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who is due to speak via videoconference at the Minority Bankers Forum in Kansas City at 4:00PM ET (20:00GMT).
Yellen told Congress on Wednesday that the central bank does not have a ""fixed timetable"" for modifying its monetary policy. However, she added that continued job creation at its current pace would cause the economy to overheat and, in that case, the Fed could be forced to raise rates faster than expected.

516,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2016 08:31AM ET</span>",Iraq's OPEC revolt shows Saudi-Iran oil deal fragility,"By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler
ALGIERS (Reuters) - For years, debates in the OPEC conference room were dominated by clashes between top producer Saudi Arabia and arch-rival Iran.
But as the two managed to find a rare compromise on Wednesday - with Riyadh softening its stance towards Tehran - a third OPEC superpower emerged.
Iraq overtook Iran as the group's second-largest producer several years ago but kept its OPEC agenda fairly low-profile. On Wednesday, Baghdad finally made its presence felt.
What it did, however, pleased neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran.
Iraq's new oil minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi told his Saudi and Iranian counterparts, Khalid al-Falih and Bijan Zanganeh, in a closed-door gathering in Algiers that ""it was an OPEC meeting for all ministers"", a source briefed on the talks said.
Luaibi also said he didn't like the idea of re-establishing OPEC's output ceiling at 32.5 million barrels per day (bpd), according to sources in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Reviving a ceiling, abandoned a year ago because of a Saudi-Iranian clash, was seen by some members as crucial in helping OPEC manage a vastly oversupplied market and prop up prices that stand well below the budget needs of most producers.
But Luaibi told the meeting the new ceiling was no good for Baghdad as OPEC had underestimated Iraq's production, which has soared in recent years.
Confusion followed, according to sources, and after a debate OPEC chose to impose a ceiling in the range of 32.5-33.0 million bpd - a decision dismissed by many analysts as weak and non-binding. OPEC's current output stands at 33.24 million bpd.
As ministers including Falih and Zanganeh emerged smiling from the room and praised OPEC's first output-limiting deal since 2008, Luaibi called a separate briefing to complain about OPEC's estimates of Iraqi output.
""These figures do not represent our actual production,"" he told reporters. If by November estimates do not change, ""then we say we cannot accept this, and we will ask for alternatives"".
Luaibi went even further and asked a reporter from Argus Media - whose data OPEC uses among other sources to compile estimates of countries' production - to disclose from where Argus' estimates were coming.
""Your sources are not acceptable. And if there is deviation from the government, then Argus will not work in Iraq,"" Luaibi told the Argus reporter.
DIFFICULT NEGOTIATIONS AHEAD
Luaibi's revolt shows the fragility of the OPEC deal.
Between now and November, when OPEC meets formally in Vienna, the group will have to overcome huge obstacles to agree a binding deal.
Key among them will be to establish at least some semblance of country quotas to make sure members limit global oversupply, which has helped halve prices since 2014 to below $50 a barrel.
Iran insists it wants to raise output to around 4 million bpd as it emerges from European sanctions. The Saudis have proposed that Iran freeze production at 3.7 million bpd. 
Riyadh is offering to cut its own production to 10.2 million bpd from 10.7 million but most analysts argue it will fall to such a level anyway as the summer heat eases, reducing the need for cooling. 
Iraq has seen spectacular gains in output in recent years and is asking oil majors to expand production further to above 5 million bpd from the current 4.7 million.
""The deal is a bit of a farce,"" one OPEC source said.
A source familiar with Iranian thinking said it was still positive that an agreement had been reached: ""No one will offer anyone a free ride. Technical committees will work out details.""
For Michael Wittner, head of oil research at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), the decision shows Saudi Arabia is turning its back on letting the market manage supply.

""It remains to be seen how many real barrels will be removed from the market. To me, the significance is way beyond that: they all sat down in a room and made a decision.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Tony Hayward, the former  BP  (LON:BP) boss, is set to step down next year as chairman of Genel Energy, which he founded in 2011 and became the biggest oil and gas producer in Iraqi Kurdistan, three sources close to the company said.
Today, Genel is struggling with a drop in oil prices, regional conflict and a large reserves downgrade.
The 59-year-old, whose tenure at BP ended abruptly following the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon Gulf of Mexico spill, has in recent weeks said in closed discussions he plans to quit his post in the second half of next year, the three sources said.
A company spokesman said that no decision has yet been made regarding the timing of such a transition.
""Genel is committed to having a strong board and, as you would expect, carefully considers succession planning in order to ensure a smooth transition of key roles at appropriate times,"" the company said.
Hayward, who is also the non-executive chairman of commodities giant  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), has short listed a number of candidates who could succeed him which ""would have prominent standing in the City,"" one source said, referring to London's financial community.
He is expected to present his nominees to the board in the next few months.
Hayward, who drew heavy criticism over his handling of the Deepwater Horizon blowout and by stating ""I want my life back,"" is expected to focus on his efforts to set up a new oil and gas exploration and production company focused on Latin America, the sources said.
Hayward may now have less than a year to revamp Genel after it posted its biggest loss ever last year and suffered a succession of setbacks which severely dented its reputation as one of the most attractive energy companies in the years following its listing in London in 2011 at the peak of the global commodities boom.
Genel shares are today at around 10 percent of their January 2014 peak, shortly before the start of the oil market rout.
After leaving BP in 2010, Hayward teamed up with financier Nat Rothschild to create investment vehicle Vallares which merged with Genel Energy in 2011. Hayward was named Genel chief executive with a mandate to expand operations in Kurdistan and Africa at a time of soaring oil prices.
A string of disappointing oil exploration campaigns in Malta, Angola and Morocco led to a $480 million write-off in early 2015.
Plummeting oil prices and escalating violence in Iraq and neighboring Syria that led to large delays in payments for oil sales to the Kurdistan Regional Government also piled pressure on the company.
Genel's stature was reduced when earlier this year it announced the halving of the reserves estimate at its flagship Taq Taq field in Northern Iraq and a subsequent $1 billion write-off which led to its biggest-ever annual loss.
The company is now increasingly turning its focus to the Turkish gas market with the development of the Miran and Bina Bawi fields in Kurdistan Genel hopes to connect via pipeline to neighboring Turkey.
In a sign of the shift in focus, Hayward stepped down as chief executive in July 2015 and was succeeded by Turkish national Murat Ozgul last year.

The oil cartel reportedly reached an agreement to limit production to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day (bpd), a reduction of 200,000 to 700,000 bpd from its current output of 33.2 million barrels.
However, the 14-member oil group said it will wait until the official OPEC meeting in Vienna on November 30 to finalize the decision, when an invitation to join cuts could also be extended to non-OPEC countries such as Russia.
The lack of details sparked skepticism among the experts on Thursday as to whether members would agree to the cut requirements allocated to them in two months’ time.
In that light, Goldman Sachs left its forecast for U.S. crude unchanged at $43 a barrel for the end of this year and $53 a barrel in 2017, pointing out that compliance to quotas was historically poor, especially in a context where oil demand was not week.
“If this proposed cut is strictly enforced and supports prices, we would expect it to prove self-defeating medium term with a large drilling response around the world,” these analysts added.
Indeed, U.S. oil rigs had already been ramping up production. According to oil service provider Baker Hughes’ latest data, the number of active rigs drilling in the U.S. increased in 12 out of the last 13 weeks.
UBS also noted that the implementation of the cuts to output, their duration and how the quotas will be allocated between members was unclear.
Morgan Stanley expressed that the reduction in output does not address oversupply in an immediate fashion.
Experts from Blackwell Global agreed, stating that a 700,000 bpd would only reduce production to early 2016 levels, relatively close to the long run high for oil supply.
“Additionally, this level of production is unlikely to have much in the way of a medium term impact on global oil prices given that much of the supply glut will need to be hoovered up first and this could potentially take quite a few months to flow through the supply chain,” they added.
Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, also showed pointed to OPEC’s poor track record of complying with quotas and noted that an “official deal” was still two months away.
“If anything this looks like another attempt to keep a floor under prices without actually having to do anything,” he said.
ADM Investor Services analyst Marc Ostwald seemed to be thinking much along the same lines.
He said the so-called deal “looks to be of the ‘we must agree something, however vague and lacking in specific detail’, with the fear that downward seasonal pressures would send oil prices into a renewed downward spiral the clear motivating factor.”
After spiking more than 5% on the news of the framework for an agreement in the prior session, investors showed caution on Thursday due to the lack of concrete details.

ALGIERS (Reuters) - OPEC agreed on Wednesday modest oil output cuts in the first such deal since 2008, with the group's leader Saudi Arabia softening its stance on arch-rival Iran amid mounting pressure from low oil prices.
""OPEC made an exceptional decision today ... After two and a half years, OPEC reached consensus to manage the market,"" said Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh, who had repeatedly clashed with Saudi Arabia during previous meetings.
He and other ministers said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would reduce output to a range of 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day. OPEC estimates its current output at 33.24 million bpd. 
""We have decided to decrease the production around 700,000 bpd,"" Zanganeh said.
The move would effectively re-establish OPEC production ceilings abandoned a year ago.
However, how much each country will produce is to be decided at the next formal OPEC meeting in November, when an invitation to join cuts could also be extended to non-OPEC countries such as Russia.
Oil prices (LCOc1) jumped more than 5 percent to trade above $48 per barrel as of 2015 GMT. Many traders said they were impressed OPEC had managed to reach a compromise after years of wrangling but others said they wanted to see the details.
""This is the first OPEC deal in eight years! The cartel proved that it still matters even in the age of shale! This is the end of the ‘production war' and OPEC claims victory,"" said Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst at Price Futures Group.
Jeff Quigley, director of energy markets at Houston-based Stratas Advisors, said the market had yet to discover who would produce what: ""I want to hear from the mouth of the Iranian oil minister that he’s not going to go back to pre-sanction levels. For the Saudis, it just goes against the conventional wisdom of what they’ve been saying."".
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Tuesday that Iran, Nigeria and Libya would be allowed to produce ""at maximum levels that make sense"" as part of any output limits.
That represents a strategy shift for Riyadh, which had said it would reduce output to ease a global glut only if every other OPEC and non-OPEC producer followed suit. Iran has argued it should be exempt from such limits as its production recovers after the lifting of EU sanctions earlier this year.
The Saudi and Iranian economies depend heavily on oil but in a post-sanctions environment, Iran is suffering less pressure from the halving in crude prices since 2014 and its economy could expand by almost 4 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Riyadh, on the other hand, faces a second year of budget deficits after a record gap of $98 billion last year, a stagnating economy and is being forced to cut the salaries of government employees.
OIL PRICE PRESSURES
Saudi Arabia is by far the largest OPEC producer with output of more than 10.7 million bpd, on par with Russia and the United States. Together, the three largest global producers extract a third of the world's oil.
Iran's production has been stagnant at 3.6 million bpd in the past three months, close to pre-sanctions levels although Tehran says it wants to ramp up output to more than 4 million bpd when foreign investments in its fields kick in.
Saudi oil revenue has halved over the past two years, forcing Riyadh to liquidate billions of dollars of overseas assets every month to pay bills and cut domestic fuel and utility subsidies last year.
""The Iranians have lived with a very tough macro backdrop for many years..."" said Raza Agha, chief Middle East economist at investment bank VTB Capital. ""So a sustained drop in oil prices has a more difficult social impact on Saudi.""
However, with unemployment in double digits, Tehran is also facing calls to maximize oil revenues and President Hassan Rouhani is under pressure from conservative opponents to deliver a faster economic recovery. 
Oil prices are well below the budget requirements of most OPEC nations. But attempts to reach an output deal have also been complicated by political rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which are fighting several proxy-wars in the Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen.
OPEC sources have said Saudi Arabia offered to reduce its output from summer peaks of 10.7 million bpd to around 10.2 million if Iran agreed to freeze production at around current levels of 3.6-3.7 million bpd.

Riyadh has raised production in recent years to compete for market share while Iran's output was limited by sanctions. Minister Zanganeh has said Iran wanted an output cap of close to 4 million bpd. Saudi output drops in winter when it needs less fuel than during summer, when cooling requirements spike.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Wednesday as data showing a large build in U.S. gasoline inventories prompted a selloff that killed an early rally on a surprise drop in U.S. crude stockpiles for a fourth straight week.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 3 cents at $45.94 a barrel by 11:03 a.m. EDT (1503 GMT). In earlier trading it had rallied by $1.22, or nearly 3 percent, to a session high of $47.19.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) fell 10 cents to $44.57, knocked off its session peak of $45.97.
Oil had also run up earlier on speculation that OPEC members gathered in Algeria could lay the foundation for a production-limiting deal in November.
U.S. crude inventories  fell by 1.9 million barrels in the week to Sept. 23, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 3.0 million barrels, data from the Energy Information Administration showed. [EIA/S]
Gasoline stocks  rose by 2.0 million barrels, far more than the gain of 178,000 barrels forecast in a Reuters poll.
""A draw again in crude was a surprise but unleaded gasoline saw an unexpected build and that comes along with a decrease in gasoline demand,"" said Tariq Zahir, trader in crude oil spreads at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.

""With the situation we are in with crude supplies, even though we have seen draws over the last few weeks, we're still well above five-year averages on inventories. So we expect any strength we see to get sold into and prices to drift to new lows after this as we get to quarter-end this weekend.""

Crude oil for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 64 cents, or 1.43%, to $45.31 a barrel by 10:35AM ET (14:35GMT). Prices, which were at around $45.40 prior to the release of the inventory data, spiked to $45.77 immediately after the report.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 1.882 million barrels in the week ended September 23. Market analysts' expected a crude-stock gain of 3.0 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply drop of 752,000 barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 631,000 barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 502.7 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 2.027 million barrels, compared to expectations for a gain of 178,000 barrels.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a decline of 1.915 million barrels.
Elsewhere, On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for December delivery tacked on 62 cents, or 1.3%, to $47.12 a barrel as investors waited to see if any kind of oil output deal can be salvaged from a meeting of major oil producers in Algeria.

However, according to market experts, chances that the meeting would yield any action to reduce the global glut appeared minimal. Instead, most believe that oil producers will continue to monitor the market and possibly postpone freeze talks to the official OPEC meeting in Vienna on November 30.

The ultra-hardline Sunni Muslim group were driven out of Shirqat on Thursday by U.S-backed Iraqi forces. Last month it lost the Qayyara oilfield, south of Mosul, to government forces thrusting northwards in an offensive to retake the largest city under IS control.
Deprived of oil income, IS will have to find other financing means such as increasing taxation and fines in areas still under its control, said Muthana Jbara, a provincial security official.
Iraqi forces have yet to recapture the Najma oilfield, near Qayyara, but its producing wells are no longer accessible to IS because of the ongoing government offensive and air strikes, according to oil and security officials. 
""Najma has yet to be liberated because some sites are in the conflict zone. The reality is that it is extremely difficult to extract and smuggle oil while our forces are advancing towards Mosul...,"" oil ministry spokesman Asim Jihad said.

Islamic State proclaimed a caliphate over parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014 but has lost a significant amount of territory since then to U.S.-backed offensives, though it still controls oil wells on Syrian land.

Natural gas for delivery in November on the New York Mercantile Exchange slumped to a daily low of $2.956 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since September 19.
It was last at $2.964 by 9:40AM ET (13:40GMT), down 8.6 cents, or 2.82%, after dipping 0.5 cents, or 0.16%, on Tuesday.
Market players looked ahead to weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build of approximately 56 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 23.
That compares with a gain of 52 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 96 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 97 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.551 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 4.0% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 7.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Gas futures have made a dramatic recovery in recent months, rising nearly 50% since hitting a 20-year low of $1.611 in early March, as an unusually warm summer helped trim a supply surplus that was weighing on prices.
Despite the recent rally, gains are likely to remain limited as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn having started on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.

Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell to a daily low of $1,325.50 a troy ounce, a level not seen since September 21. It was last at $1,329.05 by 8:45AM ET (12:45GMT), down $1.35, or 0.1%.
On Tuesday, prices sank $13.70, or 1.02%, the biggest one-day loss in almost a month, as investors took heart from an apparent win for Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton over her Republican rival Donald Trump in the first U.S. presidential debate.

Besides Yellen, Fed speakers include St. Louis Fed President James Bullard at 10:10AM ET and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans at 1:30PM ET.
There are also appearances by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester at 4:35PM ET and Kansas City Fed President Esther George, who speaks at 7:15PM ET. Both are seen as hawks by the market after they dissented at the last meeting and voted to raise rates.
Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Tuesday evening that the U.S. central bank should avoid raising interest rates too much. He added that rates should rise but that ""I don't know when"" that should happen.
Speaking shortly afterwards, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said that the Fed can raise interest rates without threatening the U.S. economic recovery, while adding that the central bank risks doing more harm by continued inaction.
The Fed left rates unchanged at a policy meeting last week, but most officials signaled a hike was likely by the end of the year. However, markets remain skeptical of such a move, with investors slashing the possibility of a December hike to around 55%, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, down from over 60% after the Fed's policy meeting last week.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.

Neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran decided to wait to dash any hopes for a formal agreement to be reached on Wednesday afternoon when major oil producers meet at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT).
Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters Tuesday that “this is a consultative meeting, while his Iranian counterpart Bijan Zanganeh insisted that it was “not the time for decision-making”.
Zanganeh did attempt to keep hopes alive for a deal at the next official meeting. “We will try to reach an agreement for November,” he said on Tuesday.
Analysts had already pointed out that markets should not expect much to be done at Wednesday’s meeting.
“Given that OPEC has failed to agree much of anything in the last 12 months, it seems unlikely that it will start now, though it could kick the oil barrel towards the November meeting,”
CMC markets’ chief market analyst Michael Hewson said in his outlook at the beginning of the week.
In a note to clients released on Monday, Morgan Stanley suggested too that the OPEC would opt to delay any decision until the next meeting.
“We expect OPEC to note how this meeting lays the foundation for a more constructive and formal discussion at the official November OPEC meeting,” these experts wrote.
Credit Suisse too suggested that that Wednesday’s gathering would serve as little more than a preparatory measure.
“As we see it, producers could at the very least announce (…) the specifics of the key proposal on the table, if they can agree to keep negotiations about the nuts and bolts of a deal alive,” these analysts said.
Going further, some experts point out that most OPEC members have no incentive to freeze or cut production.
“Indeed, most of OPEC and other major oil producers are preparing for a future of continued production expansion,” wrote expert Ellen R. Wald, Ph.D. in an analysis of their output intentions.
Morgan Stanley too noted this tendency in their report amid “reasons to be skeptical”.
“Many OPEC members have expressed plans to grow production,” they said.
“This doesn’t prevent a one-year freeze, but it runs counter to the effort,” they concluded.
While market participants waited for the International Energy Forum to wind down and looked forward to any possible comments on the results of negotiations within OPEC, oil prices were trading higher on Wednesday after data from late in the prior session from the American Petroleum Institute showed a surprise draw in U.S. crude stockpiles.
U.S. crude oil futures gained 0.60% to $44.94 at 4:07AM ET (8:07AM GMT), while Brent oil rose 0.71% to $46.85.

Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will hold informal talks at 1400 GMT on Wednesday. Its members are also meeting non-OPEC producers on the sidelines of the three-day International Energy Forum being held in Algiers and which ends on Wednesday.
Crude futures fell on Tuesday after Iran rejected an offer from Saudi Arabia to limit its oil output in exchange for Riyadh cutting supply, dashing market hopes the two major OPEC producers would find a compromise this week to help ease a global glut of crude.
The market is coming to think this week's discussions could provide the groundwork for an agreement at OPEC's formal policy meeting set for Nov. 30 in Vienna, said Vyanne Lai, oil analyst at National Australia Bank in Melbourne.
""I think OPEC producers realize they can't continue to expand production indefinitely - OPEC producers are close to maximum capacity - so there could be room for a deal (in November),"" Lai said. 
An agreement in November could provide a short-term boost to prices, Lai said, although the level of support would depend at what level output is curbed, Lai said.
""Our expectation is prices will be relatively range-bound at slightly below $50,"" Lai said.

Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up 0.01% to $1,330.55 a troy ounce.
Earlier, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said Tuesday that the U.S. economy has started to generate better wages, but they need to go higher.
""Finally incomes of working people began to rise faster than incomes of people higher up"" on the income scale, Fischer said while answering questions at Howard University after a speech. The former IMF chief economist said his comments were general in nature and when asked about the possibility of a no-interest rate economy said: ""I don't like it."" But he said the point on rates was not about monetary policy in the U.S.

Overnight, gold prices were lower during North America's session on Tuesday, extending overnight losses as markets declared Democrat Hillary Clinton as the winner of her first U.S. presidential debate with Republican Donald Trump.
Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton appeared to have edged out her Republican opponent Donald Trump in the first presidential debate, based on analysts' take on the market reaction.
Online betting companies shortened the odds on a Clinton win in the wake of the Monday night debate, leaving her as the clear favorite among bettors.
Traders are mostly expecting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to win the presidency and have not factored in the implications of a victory for Donald Trump. The idea of Trump in the White House is a worrying one for some investors who balk at his populist, unpredictable style.
Recent polls have shown a tightening race with just around six weeks to go until the November 8 election. The next presidential debate is scheduled for October 9, with the third and final clash set for October 19.
The precious metal has been well supported in recent days after the Federal Reserve held off on raising interest rates and scaled back the number of rate hikes it expects next year.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
The Fed has policy meetings scheduled in early November and mid-December. Economists believe policymakers would avoid a rate hike in November in part because the meeting falls just days before the U.S. presidential election.
Markets are currently pricing in an 8.3% chance of a rate hike at November's meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Also of note, U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly jumped in September to more than a nine-year high boosted optimism over the strength of the economy.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased to 104.1 this month from a reading of 101.8 in August, whose figure was revised from a previously reported 101.1. That was its highest level since August 2007. Analysts had expected the index to slip to 99.0 in September.

Crude oil for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was last quoted at $44.94 a barrel, up 0.02%.
The American Petroleum Institute said crude inventory estimates showed a drop of 750,000 barrels last week, coming on the heels of a substantial 7.5 million barrel draw previously. Gasoline stocks dropped 3.7 million barrels, the fourth successive week of draws above 2.0 million, while distillates fell by 300,000 barrels. Inventories at Cushing eased by 800,000 barrels.

Overnight, oil prices plunged nearly 3% during North American hours on Tuesday, extending overnight losses, after both Saudi Arabia and Iran played down expectations for a deal to freeze or cut oil production at the closely watched informal OPEC meeting on Wednesday.
Oil ministers from both countries said on Tuesday that talks among OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers in Algiers are ""consultative,"" casting doubt on the chances of any policy decision during the meeting.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for December delivery ended at $46.76 a barrel.

An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative, underscoring the difficulty for political rivals to forge consensus.

The Wall Street bank lowered its fourth-quarter West Texas Intermediate price outlook to $43 a barrel from $50 a barrel. 
""With our demand outlook unchanged, with year-on-year growth of 1.4 million barrels per day, this leaves us now forecasting that inventories will build in 4Q16 by 400 kb/d (thousands of barrels per day) vs. our prior expectation for a 300 kb/d draw during the quarter,"" the bank said in a note.
It went on to say the forecast assumes a limited additional increase in production from Libya and Nigeria of 90,000 barrels per day compared with current estimated output.
Goldman kept its 2017 average price forecast of $52 per barrel unchanged.
Crude oil futures fell on Tuesday as optimism faded for an output-limiting deal from an oil producer meeting in Algiers that has so far failed to yield any agreement to curb one of the worst supply gluts in history. [O/R]
""While a potential (oil producers') deal could support prices in the short term, we find that the potential for less disruptions and still relatively high net long speculative positioning leave risks skewed to the downside into year-end,"" the bank wrote.

546,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2016 10:56AM ET</span>","Saudis, Iran dash hopes for OPEC oil deal in Algeria","By Rania El Gamal, Alex Lawler and Vladimir Soldatkin
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Iran on Tuesday dashed hopes that OPEC oil producers could clinch an output-limiting deal in Algeria this week as sources said the group and non-member Russia were still trying to bridge differences between the kingdom and Tehran.
""This is a consultative meeting ... We will consult with everyone else, we will hear the views, we will hear the secretariat of OPEC and also hear from consumers,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters.
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said: ""It is not the time for decision-making."" Referring to the next formal OPEC meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30, he added: ""We will try to reach agreement for November."" 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will hold informal talks at 1400 GMT on Wednesday. Its members are also meeting non-OPEC producers on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum, which groups producers and consumers.
Oil prices (LCOc1) have more than halved from 2014 levels due to oversupply, prompting OPEC producers and rival Russia to seek a market rebalancing that would boost revenues from oil exports and help their crippled budgets. 
The predominant idea since early 2016 among producers has been to agree to freeze output levels, although market watchers have said such a move would fail to reduce unwanted barrels.
A deal has also been complicated by acute political rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which are fighting several proxy-wars in the Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen.
Sources told Reuters last week that Saudi Arabia had offered to reduce its output if Iran agreed to freeze production, a shift in Riyadh's position as the kingdom had previously refused to discuss output cuts.
WHAT IRAN WANTS
On Tuesday, several OPEC delegates said the positions of Saudi Arabia and Iran remained too far apart. Oil prices were down nearly 3 percent. [O/R]
Three OPEC sources said Iran, whose production has stagnated at 3.6 million barrels per day, insisted on having the right to ramp that up to around 4.1-4.2 million bpd, while OPEC Gulf members wanted its output to be frozen below 4 million.
""Don't expect anything unless Iran suddenly changes its mind and agrees to a freeze. But I don't think they will,"" an OPEC source familiar with discussions said.
The Saudi and Iranian economies depend heavily on oil, but Iran is seeing the pressure easing as it emerges from years of sanctions. Riyadh, on the other hand, faces a second year of record budget deficits and is being forced to cut the salaries of government employees.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak met Zanganeh on Tuesday in what sources said was a new attempt to persuade Tehran to play ball. 
Several other sources said Algeria and Qatar were also talking to Iran in a bid to rescue a deal. Speaking to Reuters in between meetings on whether a deal was still possible this week, Zanganeh said: ""I cannot predict.""
BLAME GAME
Iranian oil sources said Tehran wanted OPEC to allow it to produce 12.7 percent of the group's output, equal to what it was extracting before 2012, when the European Union imposed additional sanctions on the country for its nuclear activities.
Sanctions were eased in January 2016. 
Between 2012 and 2016, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf OPEC members have raised output to compete for market share with higher-cost producers such as the United States. 
As a result, Iran believes its fair production share in OPEC should be higher than its current output, which it says should rise once Tehran agrees new investments with international oil companies. Saudi output has risen to 10.7 million bpd from 10.2 million in recent months due to local needs for summer cooling.
Gary Ross, a veteran OPEC watcher and founder of U.S.-based think tank PIRA, said Saudi output had risen too steeply in recent months and even if it were cut to pre-summer levels, Iran would see an offer to freeze its own output as unfair.
""It is a carefully calculated offer because Saudi Arabia knows it will not be acceptable to Iran ... Saudi Arabia wants to put the blame of OPEC inaction in Algiers on Iran,"" Ross said.
Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets, said: ""We cannot see how Iran could possibly accept the Saudi offer. It would be like asking a long-time prisoner who was finally released from prison to go back again."" 
He said the lack of a deal in Algeria would result in further downside pressure on oil as Saudi Arabia would maintain elevated output levels and Iran would boost supply too.
Falih said he was, nevertheless, optimistic about the oil market although rebalancing was taking longer than expected.

He said record global stocks of oil had started to decline: ""How fast will it take place, it also depends on the production agreement. If there is a consensus on one in the next few months, Saudi Arabia will be with the consensus view.""

Natural gas for delivery in November on the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up 0.2 cents, or 0.07%, to trade at $3.057 per million British thermal units by 10:40AM ET (14:40GMT), not far from last week's 20-month peak of $3.166.
On Monday, prices of the fuel jumped 4.3 cents, or 1.47%, after weather reports suggested more heat and high demand for gas-fired power throughout the end of September.
Gas futures have made a dramatic recovery in recent months, rising nearly 50% since hitting a 20-year low of $1.611 in early March, as an unusually warm summer helped trim a supply surplus that was weighing on prices.
Total U.S. natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.551 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 4.0% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 7.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Despite the recent rally, gains are likely to remain limited as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn having started on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Market players looked ahead to weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build of approximately 56 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 23.
That compares with a gain of 52 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 96 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 97 billion cubic feet.

556,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2016 08:52PM ET</span>",From prairie to the White House: Inside a Tribe's quest to stop a pipeline,"By Ernest Scheyder and Valerie Volcovici
CANNON BALL, N.D./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three days after guard dogs attacked Native Americans protesting an oil pipeline project in North Dakota in early September, an unprecedented event took place at the White House.
Brian Cladoosby, president of the National Congress of American Indians, which represents more than 500 tribes, spoke to nearly a dozen of President Barack Obama's Cabinet-level advisers at a September 6 meeting of the White House's three-year-old Native American Affairs Council. 
It was the first time a tribal leader addressed a session of the council, and Cladoosby was invited in his role as the Indian Congress’ leader.
Cladoosby, a Swinomish Indian from Washington state, spoke twice at the one-hour roundtable. He told Reuters he praised the Obama administration in his opening statement for its track record on Native American issues such as pushing to reform the Indian Health Service.
But when Cladoosby gave his closing speech, he delivered an impassioned request to his audience: stand with Native Americans who have united with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and block construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,100 mile conduit to get oil from North Dakota to Illinois. 
That plea marked one of the previously unreported turning points in a drama that played out since February and culminated September 9 with an about face by the U.S. government, from giving the pipeline a green light to backing a request from North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux to halt construction of the pipeline. 
The tribe fears sacred sites could be destroyed during the line's construction and that a future oil spill would pollute its drinking water.
This month's win for the tribe, which could be reversed by regulators, is a rare instance of protests resulting in quick federal action and the triumph of an unusual alliance between environmentalists and Native Americans, who both say they were emboldened by the defeat of the Keystone XL pipeline last fall.
It also was the most galvanizing movement in Native American politics in decades, some tribal leaders said, as Crow, Navajo, Sioux and other traditional rivals united to fight what they considered an assault on their way of life.
Cladoosby did not play a high-profile role in the early days of the pipeline controversy. But that day he spoke to a high echelon of power, including Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, White House Domestic Policy Council director Cecilia Munoz, and the heads of the Departments of Energy; Agriculture; Education; Health and Human Services; and the Environmental Protection Agency, according to a senior administration official who asked not to be named and to a photo of attendees seen by Reuters.
""The world is watching,"" he said in prepared remarks shared with Reuters.
A few days earlier, video of pipeline security personnel in North Dakota armed with guard dogs and mace trying to disperse protesters went viral on social media.
One of the first videos was taken and posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) by Lonnie Favel, a member of Utah's Ute tribe who traveled to North Dakota to support the protests.
""I was getting messages of support from New Zealand, from Europe, from all over the world,"" Favel said.
Until then, Obama had not weighed in on the Dakota dispute even though he personally had visited the Standing Rock in June 2014.
Just a day after Cladoosby issued his plea to administration officials, Obama attended a young leaders conference in Laos where a Malaysian woman asked him about the Dakota Access pipeline and how he could ensure a clean water supply and protect ancestral land.
Obama said he needed to ask his staff for more information, but touted his track record protecting Native Americans' ""ancestral lands, sacred sites, waters and hunting grounds,"" adding, ""this is something that I hope will continue as we go forward.""
A FATEFUL DECISION
In late 2014, pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners made a fateful decision.
Dallas-based ETP chose to route its proposed Dakota Access pipeline away from North Dakota's capital, Bismarck, and southward within half a mile of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's reservation.
Part of its rationale, laid out in a report for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which regulates infrastructure projects that traverse certain inland waterways, was that the route would avoid Bismarck and thus pose no threat to the city's water supply. The Bismarck route also is more populated and thus would require more easements from multiple landowners. Ironically, that 139-page report concluded the Standing Rock route would raise ""no environmental justice issues"" because the pipeline would not cross tribal lands.
The Army Corps’ decision angered environmental activists and unwittingly introduced a powerful new element into the environmental movement: Indian rights groups, who quickly tapped into an extensive network of green activists forged during five long years of protests against TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline, which Obama formally nixed last November.

The protest gained steam in February when Standing Rock Sioux leaders asked for legal help from Earthjustice, an environmental law group that had previously helped U.S. tribes and Canadian First Nations fight Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline, according to Jan Hasselman, an attorney from Earthjustice working on the North Dakota case, and tribal leaders.
Two months later, about 18 tribe members started praying daily near the pipeline's planned route in North Dakota. The participants would grow in size, creating a group called the Sacred Stone Camp.
The international environmental movement soon took notice, including, 350.org, an environmentalist group that helped defeat the Keystone XL pipeline. In July, the group sent a delegation to the Sacred Stone Camp to see how they could help.
In many ways, the Dakota Access pipeline drew its inspiration from the fight to stop the Keystone XL pipeline, according to organizers from 350 and other environmental groups.
""We didn’t have to totally reinvent the wheel,” said Josh Nelson of Credo, a progressive advocacy group.
By then the Sacred Stone Camp, located alongside the confluence of the Cannon Ball and Missouri rivers about an hour south of Bismarck, had swollen in size to thousands, forming a de facto town of tents, teepees and trailers, a school, medic, communal kitchen, horse corrals and a legal clinic.
The tribal members and environmentalists agreed to seize on the U.S. Army Corps' ""fast-tracking"" of permits for the pipeline in late July, which they argued was illegal and a violation of tribal rights, 350.org told Reuters. In this case, the Corps had the right to approve pipelines in general and consider specific local concerns, such as Native issues, if appropriate. The Corps said it effectively considered its due diligence requirement met when it green lit the line in July. 
Later that same month, the tribe filed suit against the Army Corps in federal court.
INTERNAL RIFT
While the government's reversal in September caught most by surprise, a March 29 letter from the Department of the Interior to the Army Corps reviewed by Reuters shows that disagreements within the administration had been percolating for months.
The Interior department, which is responsible for protecting Native Americans' welfare, said the Army Corps ""did not adequately justify or otherwise support its conclusion that there would be no significant impacts upon the surrounding environment and community"" from the pipeline.
Energy Transfer, the Department of Justice, the Army Corps and the Department of the Interior did not respond to requests for comment.
The letter presaged the intra-government fighting ahead of the White House's decision to temporarily block the line.
The federal delay of the pipeline “isn't something that just fell out of the sky,"" Archambault, the tribe's chairman, said in an interview. ""We feed (federal regulators) information all the time on everything that's illegal here.""
Archambault declined to discuss responses from federal regulators he received.
On September 9, just three days after Cladoosby made his plea at the White House, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg rejected a request from the tribe to block the $3.7 billion project.
Minutes after that ruling, the Interior and Justice Departments, along with the Army Corps, suspended construction on a two-mile stretch of federal land below the Missouri River.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said federal regulators, who could still ultimately approve the project, called the pause to make sure the concerns of all parties were taken into account. James Gette, a senior official in the environment and natural resources division of the DOJ, noted in a September 16 hearing that construction was halted mainly because the Dakota Access pipeline didn’t have an easement for the area where the tribe gets its drinking water.
Protesters have vowed not to leave their camp until the pipeline is scrapped or moved far away from their reservation. Their concerns about potential spills, it turns out, have precedent.
An analysis of government data by Reuters shows that Sunoco Logistics, the future operator of the pipeline and a unit of ETP, has had the highest rate of spills since 2010 than any of its competitors. Sunoco told Reuters it has taken measures to reduce its spill rate.
Cladoosby admits he ""was really surprised"" by the fast moving events after his strategically-timed entreaty.
He will be back at the White House on Monday and Tuesday. Leaders of 567 native American tribes will meet with Obama in Washington to tackle a range of issues facing Native Americans from economic development to environmental protection – including the Dakota Access pipeline.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil jumped as much as 4 percent on Monday as the world's largest producers gathered in Algeria to discuss ways to support prices, with nervous trade driving volatility to its highest since a similar meeting to freeze output in April in Doha which failed.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters led by No. 1 producer Russia are meeting informally on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum in Algeria from Sept. 26-28 to discuss steps to tackle a price-eroding glut of crude.
Key OPEC member Iran, the fourth largest crude exporter which is still trying to recapture output before Western sanctions in 2012, downplayed the chances of a deal while some OPEC members remained hopeful.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were up $1.54, or 3.4 percent, at $47.43 a barrel by 1:56 p.m. EDT (1756 GMT), after trading as high as $47.66.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) rose $1.58, or 3.6 percent, to $46.06, with its session high at $46.20. 
Implied volatility, a gauge of how much oil prices move, was at its highest since April 18, when the meeting in Doha among OPEC members to discuss an output freeze ended in an impasse, leaving crude at just above $40.
Scepticism about any deal being reached prompted money managers to cut their bullish bets on U.S. crude futures to a one-month low last week, when prices fell by nearly 5 percent. [CFTC/]
Some analysts believe implementation of a freeze will only be after OPEC's all-important policy meeting in Vienna in November. Until then, the group and non-members, including Russia and No. 1 oil consumer the United States, are likely to ramp up output.
""While we look for both Russia and the OPEC membership to continue to talk up the market via bullish hype whenever crude prices decline by a few dollars a barrel, we are maintaining a view that this type of artificial price support is simply delaying the inevitable by allowing non-OPEC production, especially from U.S. shale producers, to recover further,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates.
OPEC pumped near a multi-year high of 33.24 million barrels per day in August, data showed. Russian production hit record highs of 11.75 million bpd last week. U.S. output has fallen this year but its oil rig count, which signals future production, has risen for 12 of the past 13 weeks. [RIG/U]
""The Saudis, in particular, and OPEC, in general, must decide whether they wish to maximize revenue or output,"" said a broker.
Unplanned outages across OPEC amounting to around 2 million bpd also make it hard for members to agree to a freeze, SEB commodities strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said.

""They will come away with nothing, because it is too difficult. How can they decide a freeze when Libya is on the doorstep of returning production, or Nigeria for that matter?"" Schieldrop said.

560,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2016 11:51AM ET</span>","Iran downplays chances of oil deal, UAE keen on freeze","By Alex Lawler and Rania El Gamal
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Iran downplayed on Monday the chances of OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers clinching an output-restraint deal in Algeria this week even though several other members of the group said they still hoped for steps to tackle a price-eroding glut of crude.
Oil prices have more than halved from 2014 levels due to oversupply, prompting OPEC producers and rival Russia to seek a market rebalancing that would boost revenues from oil exports and help their crippled budgets.
The predominant idea since early 2016 among producers has been to agree to freeze output levels, although market watchers have said such a move would fail to reduce unwanted barrels.
Sources told Reuters last week that Saudi Arabia had offered to reduce its output if Iran agreed to freeze production, a shift in Riyadh's position as the kingdom had previously refused to discuss output cuts.
As delegations gathered in Algiers, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said expectations should be modest.
""This is an advisory meeting and that's all we should expect from it,"" he was quoted as saying by oil ministry news service SHANA before he left Tehran. ""The talks among OPEC members can be used for the OPEC summit in Vienna in November."" 
Crude prices rose by 3.5 percent on Monday, recouping most of the losses sustained on Friday, when hopes for an output deal in Algeria faded.
One OPEC delegate said the focus was now firmly on trying to persuade Iran to freeze output at levels acceptable for the rest of the producer group.
Iran's output has been stagnant at 3.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in the past three months, close to what the country produced before the imposition of European sanctions in 2012. 
The sanctions were eased in January 2016, and Iran has said it wants to achieve output of more than 4 million bpd.
On Monday, an OPEC source said Iran was still insisting on being allowed to reach 4.1-4.2 million bpd before freezing production.
""SIGNIFICANT ACTION""
Some ministers and officials expressed hope that a deal could emerge this week.
""For us in the UAE, we are for a decision. We think a freeze will help if it is agreed. We hope that all are going to agree,"" the United Arab Emirates' energy minister, Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui, told Reuters.
Algerian Energy Minister Noureddine Bouterfa said everyone in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed that the market was badly oversupplied and the situation had worsened since the last OPEC meeting in June.
""Credible and significant action is needed to help the market rebalance ... One fundamental aspect is that OPEC production should be significantly below the level of August. The second is that the effort must be shared out.""
""Third is that any agreement be limited to the time it takes to reabsorb oil stocks. And the fourth is that the action should be credible in the eyes of the market and verifiable,"" Bouterfa told French-language Algerian daily Liberte.
Members of OPEC will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum, which groups producers and consumers, from Sept. 26-28. 
Russia is also attending but there is no evidence the country is preparing to participate in any production action.

Natural gas for delivery in December on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 4.5 cents, or 1.49%, to trade at $3.058 per million British thermal units by 10:30AM ET (14:30GMT), not far from last week's 20-month peak of $3.166.
Futures have been well-supported in recent sessions after weather reports suggested more heat and high demand for gas-fired power throughout the end of September.
Despite the recent rally, gains are likely to remain limited as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn having started on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Total U.S. natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.551 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 4.0% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 7.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.

562,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2016 10:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Russian oil majors raise output of hard-to-recover crude,"By Katya Golubkova and Olesya Astakhova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian oil majors Rosneft and Gazprom Neft are raising the share of production from hard-to-recover reserves, to counter declining conventional output, showing the complexities facing producer nations seeking to tackle a global oversupply of crude.
Top Russian producer Rosneft (MM:ROSN) expects the share of hard-to-recover oil production to rise to 11 percent of its total crude output by 2020, from 7 percent this year, it told Reuters by email in response to queries about its output plans.
It said the cost of production of such crude was between $10 and $35 per barrel. This makes it feasible to develop even in the current downturn, with prices hovering below $50 a barrel.
Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of state gas producer Gazprom (MM:GAZP), is raising its share of output of hard-to-recover oil by tapping more reserves at the Messoyakha project and other assets, First Deputy Chief Executive Vadim Yakovlev told the Reuters Russia Investment Summit.
Hard-to-recover oil refers to reserves trapped between layers of rock which cannot be accessed using conventional, vertical drilling. It requires techniques including drilling horizontal wells and fracking, similar to methods used to extract shale gas and shale oil.
As part of Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, the United States imposed restrictions on providing shale technology, in an effort to slow the growth in Russian oil output. But despite the sanctions on the Russian oil industry, oil production, including hard-to-recover, is growing.
Taming global oil output - to tackle on oversupply that has helped drive down prices since mid-2014 - is the central issue facing the world's major producers, including Russia and OPEC members, who are meeting in Algiers this week.
While any output freeze deal is likely to be short-term, the Rosneft and Gazprom Neft plans for coming years illustrate the complexities of global co-operation, as countries including top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia seek to guard their market share in the long-term.
SIBERIA
The bulk of Russian oil production still comes from conventional - cheaper, easier-to-access - reserves located in west Siberia. But they are dwindling and production in the region is declining at 1.5 to 2 percent a year.
Russia's oilfield licenses regulator Rosnedra puts the country's hard-to-recover oil reserves at around 12 billion tonnes, or 88 billion barrels - two-thirds of total oil reserves, and enough to cover 20 years of the world's total oil needs.
Rosneft is drilling for hard-to-recover oil through its biggest-producing unit, Yuganskneftegaz, where the share of this type of crude is expected to triple by 2020 from 5 percent last year.
It total, Yugansk is expected to produce 68 million tonnes of oil a year (1.37 million bpd) by 2020, a 9 percent increase on 2015. Rosneft said that hard-to-recover oil accounts for around 24 percent of Rosneft's total oil reserves.
Rosneft said it also expected hard-to-recover output to increase at its other assets in western Siberian including Uvatneftegaz, Nyaganneftegaz, Tyumenneftegaz, as well as from fields in east Siberia and the Urals-Volga region.
Horizontal wells account for around 40 percent of Gazprom Neft's total wells.
Hard-to-recover oil accounts for a big part of the Messoyakha project, a joint venture between Gazprom Neft and Rosneft which started oil output last week, Yakovlev told the Reuters summit this month.
Out of its total of around 600 million tonnes of hard-to-recover reserves, Gazprom Neft has gradually brought 150 million tonnes into the production process since 2011, Yakovlev said.
""This means we are bringing on line 30 million tonnes each year and plan to bring on line 200 million tonnes more by 2020 - so the dynamics are growing,"" he said.
Under the Ukraine sanctions, Western firms are prevented from helping both Rosneft and Gazprom Neft tapping deep water, Arctic offshore or shale oil.
But Rosneft said that sanctions had had no material impact on its development of hard-to-recover oil.
""The bulk of technology and equipment for exploring of hard-to-recover oil using horizontal wells with multiple fracking are Russia-produced,"" it said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - As Russian energy minister Alexander Novak flies to Algeria this week for talks with OPEC on output cuts, developments at home indicate non-OPEC Russia is not preparing for any coordinated production action.
Five leading Russian oil companies, responsible for three quarters of output in the world's largest producer, all say they will be boosting output next year after reaching record levels in recent months.
No doubt, all these companies would obey if President Vladimir Putin ordered them to curtail production. 
But so far Putin has had no meeting with leading Russian oil producers - state-owned or private - and even the energy ministry has yet to hold such consultations to sort out details and logistics of any output action.
""We think that it is impossible to agree... No one trusts anyone, everyone has been just ramping up production (within OPEC and outside),"" a source at Russia's leading oil producer, Rosneft, said.
Kremlin-controlled Rosneft (MM:ROSN), which accounts for over a third of Russian production, has been the biggest opponent of the global oil freeze deal since it was first discussed at the beginning of the year.
Rosneft's influential chief, Igor Sechin, a close ally of Putin, has said internal differences were killing OPEC and its ability to influence the market.
The Rosneft source said the firm's position has not changed despite the latest developments, which even saw Putin meeting Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in China in early September and the country's ministries agreeing to work together to help stabilize oil markets.
Days after the pact was signed Russia reported a new post-Soviet production record of over 11 million barrels per day.
The Russian oil landscape is also dominated by No.2 firm, private Lukoil (MM:LKOH), private producer Surgut (MM:SNGS), state-owned GazpromNeft (MM:SIBN) and Tatneft (MM:TATN).
The companies plan to raise production by around 1.6 percent on average in 2017, according to their forecasts and Reuters calculations as they benefit from a weaker rouble and cheaper costs at home.
NEW RECORDS
The jump in production comes not only thanks to conventional oil deposits but also as Kremlin oil champions Rosneft and GazpromNeft are increasing output of hard-to-extract oil, despite Western sanctions on Russian shale projects.
Analysts from Swiss bank UBS forecast a rise of 2.7 percent next year of Russia's overall oil production.
""I am skeptical not only about the agreement but about the results too,"" said Vladimir Drebentsov, chief economist for  BP  (LON:BP) in Russia and the former Soviet Union.
""As price is rising, production in the United States is rising too,"" he said.
On Monday, Iran played down chances of OPEC and non-OPEC producers clinching a deal in Algeria later this week even though several other OPEC members said they still hoped oil nations would finally take steps to address the global glut.
BP has a 20 percent stake in Rosneft, whose boss Sechin has long argued that any oil price increase as a result of joint actions by OPEC and non-OPEC will allow the United States to resume production growth from high-cost shale deposits.
The Russian energy ministry has itself delivered contradictory statements over the past week with Novak saying he was still supporting a freeze but swiftly denying his deputy Kirill Molodtsov's remarks that Russian could in theory cut output by up to five percent.

""Production is breaking new records... It would be stupid to freeze production, let alone cut it, as state coffers need money and companies are starting new fields,"" a source close to the energy ministry said.

“Globally, investments have been reduced to very low levels, inducing a potential risk of supply shortages in the medium-term,” the IEF said even as world refinery capacity has expanded with crude stocks reaching record levels.
The IEF agenda
Participants are scheduled to arrive on Monday with a welcoming reception scheduled for 14:30ET (18:30GMT).
On Tuesday the inauguration session will begin at 4:00AM ET (8:00AM GMT) followed by several plenary sessions throughout the day dealing with topics ranging from the outlook and stability challenge for oil markets, to challenges in natural gas along with the prospects and challenges for renewables and energy efficiency.
Further sessions will continue on Wednesday with a concluding statement expected at 7:30AM (11:30AM GMT), followed by a farewell lunch that will end at 9:30AM ET (13:30GMT).
Informal meeting of OPEC members
Tentatively expected for Wednesday afternoon, OPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia and other big Middle East crude exporters, such as Iran and Iraq, will hold an informal meeting in which non-OPEC producer Russia was expected to participate, although some reports last week indicated that Moscow’s representatives would not even stay until the end of the IEF.
According to market experts, chances that the meeting would yield any action to reduce the global glut appeared minimal.
Saudi Arabia had already warned that no “formal decision” would be made at the gathering.
Instead, most experts believe that oil producers will continue to monitor the market and possibly postpone freeze talks to the official OPEC meeting in Vienna on November 30.
But Algerian energy minister Noureddine Bouterfa insisted on Sunday that all options were possible for an oil output cut or freeze.
""We will not come out of the meeting empty-handed,"" Bouterfa said.
Last week, reports suggested that Saudi Arabia had also offered to reduce production if Iran caps its own output this year, an offer to which Tehran had yet to respond.
It was unclear if the offer would allow Iran to reach pre-sanction levels of production which the country has repeatedly made clear is its intention before discussing any possibility of a freeze.
An attempt to jointly curb output levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative over precisely that issue, underscoring the difficulty for political rivals to forge consensus.
Meanwhile, oil prices were finding support from the Algerian energy minister’s aforementioned comments on Sunday.

With just around six weeks to go until the November 8 U.S. presidential election, the market will turn its attention to the first televised U.S. presidential debate Monday night.
The 90-minute debate will begin at 9:00PM ET (01:00 GMT on Tuesday) at Hofstra University in New York. It is the first of three planned presidential debates.
Market participants are mostly expecting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to win the presidency and have not factored in the implications of a victory for Donald Trump. The idea of Trump in the White House is a worrying one for some investors who balk at his populist, unpredictable style.
Recent polls have shown a tightening race, with Clinton's once-comfortable lead narrowing sharply. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll gives Clinton a 4-point lead, 41% to Trump's 37%, among likely voters.
Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped $2.40, or 0.18%, to $1,339.30 a troy ounce by 4:10AM ET (08:10GMT). On Friday, prices rallied to $1,347.80, the most since September 8.
The yellow metal notched a weekly gain of $31.50, or 2.34%, last week, the best performance in almost two months, after the Federal Reserve held off on raising interest rates and scaled back the number of rate hikes it expects next year.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.

Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.35% to 100.62, moving back toward a one-month low of 100.06 touched last week.
In the week ahead, market players will be focusing on fresh comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen amid ongoing uncertainty over the timing of the next U.S. rate hike.

580,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2016 02:06PM ET</span>",Federal Reserve proposes new limits on Wall Street energy bets,"By Patrick Rucker and Olivia Oran
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Friday outlined a plan to limit Wall Street bets on the energy sector by forcing companies like Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley  to hold more capital against such investments.
Under current law,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and Morgan Stanley (N:MS) may invest in energy storage and transportation in ways that other banks cannot, but the U.S. central bank's new plan would make such bets more costly.
Banks would have to hold more capital against energy and commodity investments under the plan. The Fed also contemplated other limits like banning Wall Street control of power plants and prohibiting bank holding companies from owning copper.
At this stage the plan is only a proposal that is subject to comment and change. The Fed has opened a three-month window for comment.
The Fed, which regulates the banking and financial services sector, said the new measures would help shield banks and the broader financial system from a costly mishap like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
Under the plan, Fed officials said, banks would have to hold roughly $1 in capital for every $1 of energy infrastructure they owned.
Under the plan, Fed officials said, banks would have to hold roughly $1 in capital for every $1 of energy infrastructure they owned.
In the Fed’s calculus of bank safety, that amounts to a 1,250 percent capital charge - the regulator's highest tariff for the riskiest investments.
Wall Street would have to offer roughly $4 billion in fresh capital to satisfy the proposal.
SCALING BACK
Firms on Wall Street have already been scaling back their ownership of refinery, shipping and storage facilities in the face of scrutiny from regulators who have asked what benefit comes from banks in the raw material market.
Morgan Stanley has decreased the value of physical commodity assets on its balance sheet to $321 million in 2015 from $9.7 billion in 2011.
Goldman Sachs has shed much of its energy infrastructure, too, but the bank is still a major trader of fossil fuels.
J. Aron, Goldman's commodities arm, traded more natural gas than both  Chevron  (N:CVX) and ExxonMobil (N:XOM) in the second quarter of this year, according to Natural Gas Intelligence, a trade publication.
The energy trader moved 5.42 billion cubic feet of physical gas in the United States during the period, more than 73 percent of the volume it did during the same time in 2011, according to data.
Morgan Stanley and Goldman declined to comment on the Fed's proposal.
Between 2007 and 2009, commodities trading for banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman accounted for as much as a fifth of their overall annual revenues.
Although Goldman has scaled back its ownership of physical commodities, it has remained committed to trading.
The bank during the second quarter of 2016 earned more from that business than any of its Wall Street peers, according to data provider Coalition.

Tougher regulations conceived since the 2008 financial crisis, though, have push much of that trading business to specialists like  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc, Vitol Group and Mercuria Energy Group.

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has offered to reduce oil production if rival Iran caps its own output this year, four sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters, as Riyadh tries to strike an elusive OPEC deal to curtail supply and boost prices.
The offer, which has yet to be accepted or rejected by Tehran, was made this month, the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
OPEC holds an informal meeting next week in Algiers, which non-OPEC Russia will also join. The group, which produces a third of the world's oil, will also have a formal gathering in Vienna at the end of November.
""The Algeria meeting is not a decision making meeting. It is for consultations,"" said a source familiar with the Saudi oil thinking.
Riyadh is ready to cut output to levels seen early this year in exchange for Iran freezing production at the current level, which is 3.6 million barrels per day (bpd), the sources said.
""They (the Saudis) are ready for a cut but Iran has to agree to freeze,"" one source said. Three more sources confirmed the offer was presented to Tehran. 
A source familiar with Saudi oil thinking said: ""Our goal is to reach a consensus and look at different scenarios for the production levels of the OPEC countries. We are looking forward to a credible and transparent solution which would lead to market stability"".
A source familiar with Iranian thinking declined to comment on details of the proposal but did not rule out a compromise next week: ""Let them all talk face to face.""
There was no official comment from Saudi Arabia or Iran.
Oil prices rose on the news that Saudis were offering a deal to Iran but later pared gains to trade 4 percent lower by 1700 GMT as hopes of an agreement next week faded.
At $46 per barrel, prices are well below the budget needs of most OPEC countries and a fraction of the 2014 peak above $115 per barrel.
SEEKING CONSENSUS
Saudi output usually drops in winter and spikes during hot summer months, hence Iran could dismiss the proposed reduction as an attempt by Riyadh to present a natural decline as a cut.
Iran has been promising to boost output to 4 million bpd, although production has stagnated in the past three months at around 3.6 million bpd, indicating the new push might be difficult without additional investments.
The first source did not say by how much Riyadh would cut if Iran agreed to a freeze. The Algerian oil minister said this month that OPEC would need to reduce supply by around 1 million barrels per day to help rebalance the market.
Riyadh's production has spiked since June due to summer demand, reaching a record high in July of 10.67 million bpd and edging down to 10.63 million bpd in August. From January to May, Saudi Arabia produced around 10.2 million bpd.
Previously, the Saudis have refused to discuss a production cut.
OPEC officials from Saudi Arabia and Iran met this week in Vienna. According to sources, they did not discuss the Saudi proposal, focusing instead on baseline production figures. 
The meeting produced no breakthrough, the sources said. The source familiar with Saudi thinking said it would nevertheless help build consensus.
Two sources said Saudi Arabia's Gulf OPEC allies the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait were expected to contribute to any output reduction. 
Saudi Arabia, by far the largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, will shoulder the biggest cut, the sources said.
The proposal can be seen as a shift by Riyadh, which orchestrated the current OPEC policy in 2014 by refusing to cut output alone to support prices and chose to defend market share against rivals, particularly high-cost producers.
A fall in oil prices to $30-$50 per barrel from levels as high as $115 seen in June 2014 led to a boost in global oil demand and a decline in high-cost supplies such as those from the United States.
But the Saudi strategy caused a rift in OPEC, whose poorer members have faced a budget crisis and unrest. Riyadh and its Gulf allies also had to tighten their belts after a decade of generous public spending.
As the pain of cheap oil grew and pressures on Saudi finances increased, Riyadh and Tehran signaled they were willing to show more flexibility to prop up prices.

However, the first attempt at a global production pact collapsed in April when Riyadh insisted Tehran participate. Iran has said it will not join any such agreement until it boosts output to pre-sanctions levels.

583,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2016 11:50AM ET</span>",Libyan oil port takeover gives edge to eastern commander,"By Aidan Lewis
TUNIS (Reuters) - Less than a fortnight after forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar swept into four of Libya's oil ports, tankers are loading, production has jumped, and momentum has shifted firmly in the divisive former general's favor.
For Haftar's opponents, and for Western powers, the move on the ports was alarming. Haftar and his backers in eastern Libya have been in a stand-off for months with a unity government in Tripoli, blocking any parliamentary vote to endorse it and challenging the U.N.-mediated deal to unify Libya.
How Haftar and his allies will use control of the country's major oil exports – whether to leverage political advantage under that U.N. deal, or to extend military control across Libya – is still uncertain. But risks to stability are clear.
""I think we have to regard [Haftar's] motives with a high degree of scepticism,"" said a senior Western diplomat. ""I think there are significant risks to both the [unity government] and the whole political agreement if this is allowed to drift in the wrong direction.""
For now, the West may be forced to accept Haftar's move. After initially condemning the attack on the ports and calling on Haftar's forces to withdraw, the United States and European powers joined other countries on Thursday to ""welcome the recent transfer of the oil facilities in the oil crescent to the National Oil Corporation (NOC) as well as the plans to increase oil production and exports"".
Some even see a chance for a breakthrough between loosely aligned pro- and anti-Haftar camps that have battled each other since 2014, setting up rival institutions in eastern and western Libya and deepening the turmoil that has plagued the country since late dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.
After Haftar's forces swiftly handed operational control of the ports to the NOC, the NOC's early work to restore production has been only briefly disturbed by a counter attack that was repelled within the day.
NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said he hoped the concession of control would lead to ""a new phase of cooperation and coexistence"" between factions that have shut down most of Libya's oil output as they competed for power.
Haftar himself, whose stature has gradually risen as his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) has waged a long, bloody campaign in eastern Libya against Islamists and other opponents, has softened his tone.
The move on the ports was aimed at ""protecting national resources"" and ending a blockade that was starving Libya of revenue and causing a financial crisis, he said in comments posted online by the LNA. Western powers can ""rest assured that this operation is neither against reconciliation, nor does it have any political goals"".
Two weeks before the ports were seized, a Haftar ally suspended his boycott of the unity government's leadership, or Presidential Council, proposing a joint military council as a way of breaking a deadlock over the future leadership of the armed forces.
The Council meanwhile is working to present a new list of ministers, as requested by Haftar's allies in the eastern parliament. The Council's leader, Prime Minister Fayez Seraj, has said he is ready to meet Haftar.
Analysts and diplomats also say Haftar's forces are thinly stretched, still struggling to secure parts of the eastern city of Benghazi where they have continued to suffer heavy losses. The seizure of the ports was largely achieved through tribal negotiations and timing, the operation launched on the eve of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha.
GENERAL'S LONG HISTORY
But none of this has reassured Haftar's opponents, who see the one-time Gaddafi ally, freshly promoted by the parliament based in the east to the rank of marshal from general, as a new military autocrat in the making.
His history in Libyan politics worries critics. A one-time ally of Gaddafi, he fell out with the dictator when he was sent to lead a war in Chad, only to be captured and end up in exile in the United States. He spent decades living in Virginia.
Haftar returned to help in the uprising against Gaddafi, then reappeared again in 2014 on television in uniform to present what he said was a plan to save the country. Later, he launched an operation against Islamist militants and others in Benghazi.
He has gained support in the east, where he is seen by some as a savior. But he is far from fully supported there. In the west, particularly the port of Misrata, many Libyans despise him as a remnant of the old regime and a would-be strongman.
Opponents now point to recent moves to extend control in the east by replacing mayors with military men and cracking down on dissent, and say they need to protect the revolution of 2011, if necessary with force.
After taking the oil ports, Haftar's forces advanced to within 150 km (95 miles) of Sirte, where rival brigades from Misrata that are aligned with the unity government are nearing the end of a campaign to capture the city from Islamic State.
Opponents fear Haftar allies in the west are laying the ground for a move on Tripoli.
On Wednesday the Misratan head of a State Council, an advisory chamber that was set up in Tripoli under the U.N. deal, issued a statement condemning Haftar's oil port move and claiming to assume legislative power from the parliament in the east.
The statement appealed to ""all honorable people of Libya and its revolutionaries … to resist the military coup"" by Haftar. It called on the unity government's defense minister, a Haftar rival, ""to secure areas under its control, especially the capital, Tripoli, and respond firmly to any attempt to undermine security and stability"".
But with Misrata's own factions divided and the unity government still struggling to impose its authority on armed groups that control the capital, there may be little scope for them to push back.
""I don't think the Presidential Council has many alternatives or much margin for maneuver,"" said a North African diplomatic source.
""It seems to me that they are in a position where they have to move towards a negotiated, peaceful solution that brings an answer for a population that unfortunately has lost all its patience … If not, a counter action could just serve to make the opposing party even more popular.""

584,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2016 11:36AM ET</span>","Sunoco, behind protested Dakota pipeline, tops U.S. crude spill charts","By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Sunoco Logistics  (N:SXL), the future operator of the oil pipeline delayed this month after Native American protests in North Dakota, spills crude more often than any of its competitors with more than 200 leaks since 2010, according to a Reuters analysis of government data.
The lands of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sit a half mile south of the proposed route of the Dakota Access pipeline. The tribe fears the line could destroy sacred sites during construction and that a future oil spill might pollute its drinking water.
A tribal protest over the $3.7 billion project drew broad support from other Native American tribes, domestic and international environmental groups and Hollywood celebrities.
In response to the tribe's objections, the U.S. government earlier this month called for a temporary halt to construction along a section of the 1,100 mile line in North Dakota near the Missouri River.
While environmental concerns are at the heart of the Standing Rock Sioux protest, there is no reference to the frequency of leaks by Sunoco or its parent Energy Transfer Partners (N:ETP) in a legal complaint filed by the tribe, nor has Sunoco's spill record informed the public debate on the line.
Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II told Reuters the tribe was aware of the safety record of Energy Transfer, but declined to elaborate.
Sunoco Logistics is one of the largest pipeline operators in the United States. Energy Transfer is constructing the Dakota Access pipeline to pump crude produced at North Dakota's Bakken shale fields to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Once completed, it will hand over the pipeline's operation to Sunoco.
Sunoco acknowledged the data and told Reuters it had taken measures to reduce its spill rate.
""Since the current leadership team took over in 2012, Sunoco Pipeline has enhanced and improved our integrity management program,"" Sunoco spokesman Jeffrey Shields told Reuters by email.
This significantly cut the amount of barrels lost during incidents, he said.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not make any reference to the company's spill rate when it decided to stall the project. It highlighted the need for reform in the way companies building infrastructure consult with Native American tribes.
Spokespeople for the Departments of Justice and the Interior, and the Army Corps declined to comment to Reuters on whether they were aware of Energy Transfer's leak statistics when they jointly decided to halt construction of the line.
HIGH SPILL RATE
Reuters analyzed data that companies are obliged to disclose to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) when they suffer spills and found that Sunoco leaked crude from onshore pipelines at least 203 times over the last six years. 
PHMSA data became more detailed in 2010. In its examination, Reuters tallied leaks in the past six years along dedicated onshore crude oil lines and excluded systems that carry natural gas and refined products. The Sunoco data include two of its pipeline units, the West Texas Gulf and Mid-Valley Pipeline.
That made it the operator with the highest number of crude leak incidents, ahead of at least 190 recorded by Enterprise Products Partners (N:EPD) and 167 by  Plains All American Pipeline  (N:PAA), according to the spill data reported to PHMSA, which is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation.
Enterprise said it has comprehensive safety and integrity programs in place and that many spills happened at its terminals.
Sunoco and Enterprise both said most leaks take place within company facilities and are therefore contained.
Plains All American did not respond to a request for comment. 
Sunoco's spill rate shows protestors may have reason to be concerned about potential leaks.
The main option that was considered for routing the line away from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation was previously discarded because it would involve crossing more water-sensitive areas north of the capital Bismarck, according to the project's environmental assessment.
To be sure, most pipeline spills are small and pipelines are widely seen as a safer way to move fuel than alternatives such as rail.
Sunoco and its units leaked a total of 3,406 net barrels of crude in all the leaks over the last six years, only a fraction of the more than 3 million barrels lost in the largest spill in U.S. history,  BP  Plc's (L:BP) Macondo well disaster in 2010.
Sunoco said it found that crude lines not in constant use were a significant source of leaks, so it had shut or repaired some of those arteries.
In 2015, 71 percent of pipeline incidents were contained within the operator's facility, according to a report by the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, a trade group.
While total pipeline incidents have increased by 31 percent in the last five years, large spills of 500 barrels or more are down by 32 percent over the same time, the report said.
Sunoco accounted for about 8 percent of the more than 2,600 reported liquids pipeline leaks in the past six years in the United States.
SAFETY OVERHAUL 
The company has made previous efforts to improve safety, a former Sunoco employee who declined to be identified said. It overhauled safety culture after a spill in 2000, and did so again another in 2005 that dumped some 6,000 barrels of crude into the Kentucky River from its Mid-Valley Pipeline.
Sunoco acknowledged that some of its pipeline equipment dates back to the 1950s. 
A 2014 corrective measure regulators issued for Sunoco's Mid-Valley Pipeline cited ""some history of internal corrosion failures"" as a potential factor in a leak that sent crude into a Louisiana bayou near an area used for drinking water.
Crude spills on Sunoco's lines in 2009 and 2011 drew a rebuke from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in a settlement announced this year. 
The EPA said the settlement aimed to ""improve the safety of Sunoco's practices and to enhance its oil spill preparedness and response.""

In September, Sunoco received another corrective measure for its newly constructed Permian Express II line in Texas, which leaked 800 barrels of oil earlier this month. The company is already contesting a proposed $1.3 million fine from regulators for violations related to welding on that line.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Aboriginal tribes from Canada and the northern United States signed a treaty on Thursday to jointly fight proposals to build more pipelines to carry crude from Alberta's oil sands, saying further development would damage the environment.
The move came as Native American tribes on Thursday took their fight to Washington to stop development of the $3.7 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline, which would cross federally managed and private lands in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois.
Last week the U.S. Justice Department intervened to delay construction of the pipeline in North Dakota.
The Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion was signed by 50 aboriginal groups in North America, who also plan to oppose tanker and rail projects in both countries, they said in a statement.
Targets include projects proposed by  Kinder Morgan  Inc (NYSE:KMI), TransCanada Corp and Enbridge Inc.
While aboriginal groups have long opposed oil sands development, the treaty signals a more coordinated approach to fight proposals.
Among the treaty's signatories is the Standing Rock Sioux tribe who opposes the Dakota pipeline.
""What this treaty means is that from Quebec, we will work with allies in (British Columbia) to make sure that the Kinder Morgan pipeline does not pass,"" Kanesatake Grand Chief Serge Simon said in the statement. 
""And we will also work with our tribal allies in Minnesota as they take on Enbridge's Line 3 expansion, and we know they'll help us do the same against Energy East,"" he said, referring to TransCanada's plan to carry 1.1 million barrels of crude per day from Alberta to Canada's East Coast.
The statement did not specify what actions the groups would take to stop development.
The Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, whose members include the targeted companies, said in a statement that the industry would listen to aboriginal concerns.
""The fact remains there is a critical need for pipelines in Canada,"" the association said, noting that they are the safest and most environmentally friendly way to move oil and gas.

Canada is assessing oil pipeline proposals as the country's energy-rich province Alberta reels from a crash in prices, partly due to insufficient means of moving oil to lucrative international markets.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rallied again on Thursday, boosted for a second day by U.S. government data that showed a surprising crude inventory drop, but crude futures pared gains as traders worried that OPEC was not nearing an agreement to reduce a global glut.
Oil prices got more support from the dollar's (DXY) slide a day after the Federal Reserve kept U.S. interest rates unchanged. [FRX/]
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) settled up 98 cents, or 2.2 percent, at $46.32 a barrel. The session high for WTI was $46.52.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) rose 82 cents, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $47.65. The session peak for Brent was $47.83.
Week-to-date, WTI rose 8 percent and Brent 4 percent, on track to their biggest weekly advance in nearly a month.
Crude futures gave back some gains after Reuters reported that a two-day expert-level meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on production cooperation had yielded no major breakthrough.
The meeting was held in advance of Sept. 26-28 talks in Algeria between OPEC and other major oil producers to discuss a potential output freeze.
""A production freeze won't be enough, we need real cuts,"" said Phil Davis, trader at PSW Investments in Woodland Park, New Jersey. ""I'm shorting WTI once it gets to $47.50 because I don't think anything good will come out of these talks.""

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - As far as OPEC decision-making is concerned, Algeria, which plays host to oil ministers next week, has always been the land of surprises.
The last two meetings of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) held in Algeria -- in 2004 and 2008 -- shocked the market with unexpected production cuts to prop up prices.
The stars could align for OPEC again next week when its ministers return to Algiers and look ready to curb output for the first time in eight years, according to OPEC officials and sources.
Saudi Arabia and Iran, arch-rivals in oil markets and in politics, are sending conciliatory signals that they want to work together, along with Russia which is involved in talks although not a member of OPEC. This comes despite their backing for different sides in conflicts in Yemen and Syria.
Behind the scenes, OPEC experts are trying to work out last-minute details for an output-limiting deal that would impress the market but also allow oil ministers to claim victories at home in front of their respective domestic audiences.
""This time I think (things are) a little bit different because circumstances are a little bit better, helping (producers) to reach a deal,"" Iraq's OPEC governor Falah Alamri said on Thursday.
He said OPEC had to act when it meets Russia on the sidelines of an energy producers and consumers conference in Algeria next week simply because current oil prices at $45-50 per barrel were not acceptable to the group's members. [O/R]
Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia have all ramped up output to historic highs over the past year to fight for market share with higher-cost producers such as the United States where production has been declining due to low oil prices.
Iraq is seen as one of key stumbling blocks to a global oil production deal given that it wants to increase output further next year, while Russia and Iran have probably both hit peak capacity and Saudis have never tested higher production levels.
But Alamri said Iraq would not kill the deal: ""We are not intending to flood the market, we are intending to support the market.... we will not participate in any action that will reduce the price.""
OPEC EXPERTS MEETING
OPEC last reduced supply in 2008 when the global economic crisis crippled demand.
The first attempt at an output freeze deal between OPEC and Russia collapsed earlier this year after the Saudis said Iran needed to contribute to it as production recovered following the end to Western sanctions in January.
Tehran has argued its production needs to reach pre-sanction levels before it agrees to any action. In the past three months, Iranian oil output has stagnated but Tehran is still insisting on certain exemptions from any OPEC deals to curb supplies.
Saudi Arabian and Iranian OPEC officials are meeting in Vienna this week, according to sources, to try to figure out the shape of a possible output deal.
""It seems that they all want to get some sort of consensus in Algiers. You can see that in the amount of meetings and diplomacy taking place. There is a real push,"" an OPEC source said.
Other sources said the main debate was about baseline production figures from which output could be frozen or cut.
OPEC has two sets of figures, estimates by countries themselves and estimates by independent market experts known as secondary sources.
The latter estimates have recently been lower and a more accurate reflection of actual production numbers. Gulf producers are insisting on using these in any output deal, according to sources, in order to help better monitor supply levels.
One OPEC source familiar with discussions suggested that if output was frozen at levels seen at the start the year or the average of the first six months of 2016, it would effectively represent a cut from current real production levels.
""Logically speaking, it could be viewed as a cut if (all) agreed on using secondary sources,"" the OPEC source said.
Several other OPEC sources said that Libya and Nigeria could be granted exemptions as their output is curtailed by unrest.
SCENE OF SURPRISES
OPEC's last two meetings in Algeria produced surprise, bullish outcomes.
In the city of Oran in December 2008, ministers emerged from hours of talks to announce a huge supply cut of 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd), causing prices to jump. The number actually included earlier cutbacks from previous meetings in the year.
And in 2004, when growing Chinese demand was straining supply, OPEC met in Algiers and announced a surprise supply cut. Prices jumped and within weeks the decision was reversed.
Now, OPEC produces a third of global crude or around 33.5 million barrels per day with Russia and the United States producing around 10-11 million bpd each.
Record OPEC production has led to a massive spike in global oil stocks, currently standing at over 3 billion barrels.
The International Energy Agency said this month oil supply will outpace demand at least until the second half of 2017, meaning prices will remain depressed and further stretching the budgets of OPEC producers and Russia.
Several OPEC officials have publicly suggested levels by which global output shall drop to help prices recover.
Algeria's oil minister said this week supply should be reduced by at least one million bpd. Russia said it was in theory ready to cap output by 5 percent.
OPEC's secretary general has said the output freeze deal shall last to October 2017.
""It is the closest OPEC has come to a deal in a long time but of course challenges remain and the elephant in the room is Iran and to a certain extent Iraq,"" said Amrita Sen from Energy Aspects.
She said that if OPEC cut output by 1 million bpd it would help rebalance the market as it would reduce stocks by 290-330 million barrels over the course of the year, even if U.S. production started to recover due to higher oil prices.

Natural gas for delivery in October on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 2.5 cents, or 0.82%, to trade at $3.032 per million British thermal units by 10:35AM ET (14:35GMT). Futures were at around $3.059 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 52 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 16, matching expectations.
That compared with a gain of 62 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 105 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 83 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.551 trillion cubic feet, 4.0% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 7.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
On Wednesday, gas futures surged to a 16-month high of $3.098 after weather reports suggested more heat and high demand for gas-fired power through the end of September.
Despite the recent rally, gains are likely to remain limited as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Unless intense late-summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles could possibly test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude oil inventories fell by 6.2 million barrels last week to 504.6 million, surprising market analysts who expected an increase of 3.35 million barrels.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories tumbled by 3.204 million barrels, compared to expectations for a decline of 0.567 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles rose by 2.238 million barrels, compared to forecasts for an increase of 0.250 million.

At the same time, the U.S. central bank also cut the number of rate hikes it expects next year and in 2018, according to the median projection of forecasts released with its post-meeting statement.
The Fed has policy meetings scheduled in early November and mid-December. Economists believe policymakers would avoid a rate hike in November in part because the meeting falls just days before the U.S. presidential election.
Markets are currently pricing in a 15% chance of a rate hike at November's meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. For December, odds stood at around 60%.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
In the currency market, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.45% to 95.05 early Thursday, well off the prior session's six-week high of 96.29.

600,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2016 06:30AM ET</span>",White House seeks improved tribal relations as pipeline fight lingers,"By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leaders of hundreds of Native American tribes will meet with President Barack Obama at his eighth and final Tribal Nations Conference at the White House next week, while thousands of activists are encamped on the North Dakota prairie protesting a $3.7 billion oil pipeline. 
The conference, designed to improve the relationship between Washington and the tribes, offers the last chance for this administration to hear from tribal leaders about the shortcomings of the current consultation system, which has been a source of conflict over the pipeline and other projects.
Federal agencies take different approaches to consulting with the tribes. 
Obama, who will leave office in January, likely wants to do what he can before his term ends to fix the consultation system.
The North Dakota encampment represents the largest Native American protest in decades.
Along with environmentalists, the tribes say the 1,100-mile (1,886-km) Dakota Access pipeline, being developed by  Energy Transfer Partners LP  (N:ETP), would threaten the water supply and sacred sites of the Standing Rock Sioux.
The administration stepped in unexpectedly on Sept. 9 to temporarily block construction of the pipeline and called for ""a serious discussion"" about how the tribes are consulted by the government in decisions on major infrastructure projects.
""There are going to be hundreds of tribes interested in this consultation process. It will not be easy logistically, politically or substantively,"" said Gabe Galanda, an attorney in Seattle who represents tribal governments.
VARYING APPROACHES
At present, the Army Corps of Engineers, which manages many infrastructure projects for the government, takes one approach to consulting Native American tribes. The Interior Department and its Bureau of Indian Affairs take another. Laws overlap.
The result can be confusion and sometimes anger, as with Dakota Access, said Bryan Newland, a lawyer and former adviser to the assistant secretary for Indian Affairs at the Interior Department until 2012.
A goal of the upcoming discussions will likely be simply to clarify what is meant by ""consultation.""
The Interior Department and Bureau of Indian Affairs tend to hold face-to-face bilateral meetings with tribal leaders. The Corps often is accused of ""checking marks on a checklist and moving on with what the developer intends to do,"" said Galanda.
Ron His Horse is Thunder, spokesman for the Standing Rock Sioux, said: ""There's an issue between what the Corps believes is consultation and what the tribe believes is consultation.”
Before the Dakota Access protest erupted, tribe members voiced specific concerns with the government about the proximity of the pipeline to sacred burial sites, but these concerns were ignored, according to His Horse is Thunder.
But Amy Gaskill, public affairs chief for the Corps' northwest division, said the tribe canceled several scheduled meetings. This was documented in a judge's decision to reject the tribe's request for an injunction, she said.
""We redoubled our efforts to work with the tribe to make sure their voice was heard in the process,"" Gaskill said.
Energy Transfer Partners said last week it remained committed to the pipeline project, which had been slated to begin carrying oil south from the Bakken shale field by the end of 2016.
TOWARD REFORM
Sixteen years ago, President Bill Clinton issued an executive order requiring agencies to consult with Native Americans on matters affecting them. Obama in 2009 issued a memo intended to strengthen consultations with the tribes.
But doing that requires constant attention, said David Hayes, a former deputy secretary of the Interior under Clinton and Obama. ""It is the kind of thing that requires diligence in terms of federal officials ensuring they are not simply treating tribes like any other stakeholder,"" Hayes said.
Some agencies do not treat the tribes as sovereign nations, as they should under law, said Wizipan Garriott Little Elk, a former Department of Interior official. 
“So often you see the agency request the consultation with the president of a tribal nation, but the agency will send a low-level bureaucrat to the meeting and simply check off the consultation box,” Garriott said.
The Corps also weighs a narrower geographic scope for projects than other agencies, so it can overlook impacts outside the immediate range of a reservation, Newland said.
Talks between tribal leaders and the administration are likely to expose a consultation system that makes tribes feel disadvantaged, said Emily Mallen, a lawyer with Van Ness Feldman specializing in pipelines.

""It is unknown how the federal government might seek to resolve this issue. The only thing that is sure is that the tribal consultation process will likely see significant changes as a result,"" she said.

The Ministry of Commerce said the probe will look at imports since 2011 and into possible protectionist measures provided by foreign countries for their producers. It will last six months, with an option to extend the deadline, it said.
The government did not say which countries it would target as part of the probe. Thailand, Brazil and India are the world's largest sugar producers and China is the world's top buyer.
The move follows years of lobbying by the domestic industry as mills have struggled with rising farming costs, particularly the high local sugar price which is set by the government.
This year though, business conditions have improved with a resurgence in global refined sugar prices and imports of sweetener have fallen.
The investigation also comes a week after the United States filed a challenge with the World Trade Organization over Beijing's price supports for its grain farmers.

605,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2016 09:40PM ET</span>","Under global scrutiny, China has to cut steel exports: industry body","By Manolo Serapio Jr
DALIAN, China (Reuters) - China's international commitment to cut its massive steel capacity has to result in a reduction in exports, an official from the World Steel Association said, as countries around the world scrutinize Beijing's progress tackling a chronic glut.
While the world's biggest steel producer appears to be throwing more weight behind efforts to cut capacity, China's 2016 exports remain on track to beat last year's record 112 million tonnes and domestic production rose for a sixth straight month in August.
""They have to reduce exports. Unless they reduce exports.. (the capacity cuts) are not effective,"" Kazuo Tanimizu, head of the raw materials committee at the World Steel Association, told Reuters on the sidelines of a Chinese steel and iron ore conference. 
""It's an international commitment.""
Faced with global anger from Asia to the United States and Europe over a flood of cheap Chinese steel products, Beijing promised to cut steel capacity this year by 45 million tonnes and by 100-150 million tonnes over five years. 
By the end of July, China had only achieved 47 percent of its 2016 target and steel exports in the first eight months had risen 6.3 percent from a year ago to 76.35 million tonnes.
China's surplus steel capacity stands at around 300 million tonnes, according to industry estimates, or about triple the 2015 output of the world's second-biggest producer Japan.
""We are monitoring how they will achieve their target,"" said Kanimizu. ""Honestly speaking their production isn't going down.""
The World Steel Association represents more than 150 steel producers covering 85 percent of the world's production, including some major Chinese producers. 
Crude steel production by member mills of the China Iron and Steel Association rose 4.7 percent in the first 10 days of September from late August to 1.76 million tonnes per day, the highest since June, according to Macquarie.
China's own steel demand has peaked, said Kanimizu, while demand in some other emerging economies, such as India, which is driven by its infrastructure boom, is gaining momentum.
Jeremy Platt, an analyst at UK steel consultancy MEPS, believes China's steel exports will remain high at around 100 million tonnes a year for the foreseeable future.

The capacity cuts have to mean a reduction in net capacity and not just a case of outdated plants being replaced by new ones, said Platt.

Prices pared gains as markets digested the information, but U.S. crude managed to hold above the $45 psychological level.
Crude oil for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained 109 cents, or 2.47%, to trade at $45.19 a barrel by 10:34AM ET (14:34GMT) compared to $44.91 ahead of the report. West Texas Intermediate oil hit an intraday high of $45.47 immediately after the report.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 6.2 million barrels in the week ended September 16. Market analysts' expected a crude-stock increase of 3.35 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply draw of a whopping 7.5 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, rose by 0.526 million barrels last week, the EIA said. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 504,6 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.

Natural gas for delivery in October on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to an intraday peak of $3.098 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since May 19, 2015.

A day earlier, futures soared 11.3 cents, or 3.85%, after weather reports suggested more heat and high demand for gas-fired power through the end of September.
Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build of approximately 50 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 16.
That compares with a gain of 62 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 105 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 83 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.499 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 5.3% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 8.6% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Despite the recent rally, gains are likely to remain limited as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Unless intense late-summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles could possibly test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped over 1 percent on Wednesday, pushed by a reported draw in U.S. crude inventories and an oil service worker strike in Norway which may impact output.
Firm import data from Japan also supported prices, traders said.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were up 1.93 percent, or 85 cents, at $44.90 a barrel at 0644 GMT. The October contract expired Tuesday at $43.44 a barrel and the front-month has now rolled over to November delivery.
Traders said the main WTI price driver was American Petroleum Institute data showing a 7.5 million barrel draw to 507.2 million barrels in U.S. crude inventories.
Official storage data is due to be published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) later on Wednesday, and traders said they were also eagerly anticipating a meeting by the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which might influence U.S. interest rates.
""Wednesday has become 'Big Wednesday' for oil traders, with not only the FOMC but also the EIA crude inventory numbers out … Should they (EIA) follow the unexpected drawdown like the API and we get no FOMC rate hike, oil bulls may well have reason to be cheering after a tough couple of weeks,"" said Singapore-based brokerage Oanda.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $46.53 per barrel, up 65 cents, or 1.42 percent, from their last close, supported by an oil service worker strike in Norway that risks impacting output in western Europe's biggest crude producer.
Traders said that Brent was also being supported by firm imports from Japan.
Japan's crude imports rose 0.5 percent in August from the same month a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance said on Wednesday, reaching 3.38 million barrels per day last month.
Overall, however, oil markets remain oversupplied as exporters around the world pump near record amounts.
Oil producers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia plan to meet in Algeria next week to discuss measures to rein in the oversupply, including an oil production freeze at current output levels, but analysts said they did not expect significant results.
""OPEC members will not agree on a production freeze ... Political tensions will prevent cohesion, and individual members will continue to protect market share from resilient non-OPEC producers,"" BMI Research said in a note to clients.
""Even with a freeze - which would still mean OPEC production is at record levels - we will still be in an oversupplied market,"" said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services (FIS) in Dubai.

MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - A possible deal to support oil prices by the world's leading producer countries may last for one year, the secretary-general of OPEC said on Tuesday, longer than other officials have indicated. 
OPEC and non-member producers including Russia are discussing a deal to stabilize the market by at least freezing output, although key details such as the timing and baseline for any deal have yet to emerge.
""One year, we are looking at one year,"" OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said, RIA news agency reported.
Russia and members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries hold an informal meeting in Algiers on Sept. 28. Algeria's energy minister said on Monday any OPEC move to freeze output would help balance the market for at least six months. 
Several producers have called for an output freeze to rein in a supply glut that triggered a price collapse in the last two years, hitting their income. Previous talks on an output freeze collapsed in April.
One potential stumbling block - Iran's insistence on boosting exports after sanctions on it were lifted in January - is less of an issue this time because Iran's own figures suggest its production is close to pre-sanctions levels.
Two OPEC sources were optimistic an agreement in principle could be reached.
""I think we're likely to reach a consensus,"" said an OPEC source familiar with discussions. ""There will not be a decision. The decision will be shelved until we meet in November.""
The source was referring to the next scheduled gathering of OPEC ministers to be held on Nov. 30 in Vienna.
Another OPEC source said there was strong momentum around having at least the outline of a deal agreed next week.

""A production freeze is what we all want, but I'm not sure if we will finalize all the discussions at this meeting,"" this source said.

""Oil ministers may decide to hold an extraordinary meeting immediately,"" he said.
Algeria has been pushing for oil to be stabilized at around $60 a barrel. Bouterfa has traveled to Qatar, Iran and Russia to lobby for action to steady the market.

626,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2016 05:20AM ET</span>",Nigeria must consider oil asset sales as foreign loans delayed: Senate leader,"By Libby George
ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria must consider selling stakes in joint ventures with oil majors and other assets as talks to borrow abroad have not succeeded yet and would in any case not generate enough funds to stimulate economic recovery, the leader of the Senate said.
Senate President Bukola Saraki, the third most powerful official in Africa's biggest economy, also said the oil producer might struggle with recession for up to nine months or even longer unless it got serious about attracting investors.
The government said this month it had approved loans from China, the World Bank, Japan and the African Development Bank, but Saraki, whose relations with the president have cooled since last year, said such talks were still ongoing with no deals yet.
""There is a big hole now in the fiscal deficit because that funding is not coming through. So we've got to look for alternative ways to fund that,"" Saraki said in a joint interview with the Financial Times on Monday when asked about the loans.
The government has said it plans to borrow as much as $10 billion, with half of that coming from foreign sources, including a planned $1 billion Eurobond issue, to fund a budget deficit of 2.2 trillion naira ($7.21 billion) and boost an economy hammered by low oil prices and hard currency shortages.
Saraki said that even if the loan talks succeeded, the amount raised would not be enough to plug the hole in public finances. ""My take is that even if it does come through, it's money too little, too late,"" he said, referring to the loan talks.
He said Nigeria needed to sell stakes in oil and gas joint ventures, oil exploration contracts and refineries to raise funds. ""In my view, I really can't see any other pathway to recovery. We need investors, we need to raise capital.""
Such an asset sale would be necessary even if global crude prices recovered to $70 a barrel and Nigeria managed to restore oil production to 2 million barrels per day (bpd) with an end to militant attacks in the Niger Delta oil hub, Saraki said. Officials say the attacks have reduced output by 700,000 bpd.
Saraki said Nigeria could overcome recession in six to nine months if swift action was taken -- a more downcast view than that of the government, which has forecast a quick recovery.
Central bank governor Godwin Emefiele was due to hold a news conference at around 1315 GMT (09:15 a.m. EDT) after a meeting of the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. The finance minister said on Monday the central bank should lower interest rates so that the government can borrow domestically to boost the economy.
Economists polled by Reuters last week predicted that the central bank would keep its key interest rate at 14 percent and reiterate its focus on resuscitating growth.
The government has said it is considering asset sales, but has given no details.
""If we do things right, the confidence will come in,"" Saraki said. ""If we carry on waiting for government revenues to go up, if we don't do anything seen as thinking out of the box"" the recession could drag on longer.
Nigeria's 2016 budget was the largest in the nation's history, but the oil price drop and Delta attacks have left the government scrambling for funds.
Saraki is from the same ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as President Muhammadu Buhari, who was elected in March 2015 on a promise to end graft and mismanagement in the West African nation.
But relations between the two have been strained since Saraki ran unopposed for the position of Senate president last year, mainly with the backing of the opposition. He was not the APC's preferred candidate.

Global oil supply of 94 million barrels per day needs to fall by about a tenth if it is to match consumption, Venezuela's Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino said on Monday.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for November delivery dipped 25 cents, or 0.55%, to trade at $45.70 a barrel by 4:35AM ET (08:35GMT), not far from a six-week low of $45.31.
On Monday, London-traded Brent futures spiked higher after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said that OPEC and non-OPEC countries were ""close"" to reaching a deal to stabilize oil markets. But prices ended well off the highs amid skepticism over whether such a deal can be agreed upon.
OPEC members, led by Saudi Arabia and other big Middle East crude exporters, will meet non-OPEC producers led by Russia at informal talks in Algeria between September 26 and 28.
According to market experts, chances that the meeting would yield any action to reduce the global glut appeared minimal. Instead, most believe that oil producers will continue to monitor the market and possibly postpone freeze talks to the official OPEC meeting in Vienna on November 30.
An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative, underscoring the difficulty for political rivals to forge consensus.
Elsewhere, crude oil for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 27 cents, or 0.62%, to $43.59 a barrel. The contract touched a six-week low of $43.35 on Friday amid signs of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity.
Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week rose by 2 to 416, marking the 11th increase in 12 weeks.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday after Venezuela said that global supplies needed to fall by 10 percent in order to bring production down to consumption levels, and technical indicators also pointed to cheaper crude futures.
Global oil supply of 94 million barrels per day needs to fall by about a tenth if it is to match consumption, Venezuela's Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino said on Monday.
International benchmark Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) were trading at $45.82 per barrel at 0649 GMT, down 13 cents from their last close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were down 19 cents at $43.11 a barrel.
""Global production is at 94 million barrels per day, of which we need to go down 9 million barrels per day to sustain the level of consumption,"" Del Pino said in an interview with state oil company PDVSA's internal TV station.
Del Pino is also the president of PDVSA.
The statements came the same day as credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's said that a proposed bond swap by PDVSA was a ""distressed exchange"" that would be ""tantamount to default"" if completed, a blow to the cash-strapped firm's effort to seek a financial lifeline.
Technical market indicators were also weak, with WTI likely to test support at $42.78 per barrel soon, after which a fall towards $42 would be likely, according to Reuters analyst Wang Tao.
For Brent, he said prices may test support at $45.63 per barrel and, failing to hold that level, could fall to just over $45 a barrel.
Despite the bearish market mood on Monday, hedge funds scaled back some of their short positions in crude oil futures and options after prices failed to fall further, suggesting the market was running out of negative momentum.

Along with other money managers, they cut their combined short position in the three main Brent and WTI contracts by 36 million barrels in the week to Sept. 13.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose 1 percent on Monday after Venezuela hinted that OPEC members and other major oil producers could agree to a deal to freeze output, and as clashes in Libya disrupted attempts to restart crude exports from key ports.
U.S. gasoline futures fell on profit-taking from last week's rally on the outage of a key gasoline pipeline due to a leak.
Oil was also supported by higher equity prices on Wall Street and a weaker dollar that made greenback-denominated commodities, such as crude, more affordable to holders of the euro and other currencies. (N) [FRX/]
Brent crude futures were up 40 cents at $46.17 a barrel by 1:24 p.m. EDT (1724 GMT), reaching as high as $46.93 earlier.

Clashes in Libya on Sunday, however, halted the loading of the first oil cargo from the port of Ras Lanuf.
Oil prices also rose after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on Sunday that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major oil producers were close to reaching a deal on price stability.

Still, with the Algiers talks approaching, some opinions were shifting.
""We think there is a great window of opportunity for a freeze here,"" Natixis analyst Deshpande Abhishek said. ""It will not just help balance the markets, but it is also a win-win for OPEC and Russia, as Iran is unlikely to add extra production anyway for the next 6-12 months.""

Natural gas for delivery in October on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 2.9 cents, or 0.98%, to trade at $2.919 per million British thermal units by 10:17AM ET (14:17GMT), not far from last week's two-and-a-half-month peak of $2.978.
Futures soared more than 5% last week after weather reports suggested more heat and high demand for gas-fired power throughout September.
Despite the recent rally, gains are likely to remain limited as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Total U.S. natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.499 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 5.3% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 8.6% above the five-year average for this time of year.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who attended the summit, said Tehran supported any move to stabilize the global oil market and lift prices, according to the Iranian Oil Ministry news agency, SHANA. 
Venezuela has been seeking an oil deal for years as its state-led economy reels under low oil prices, and has often said it was close to reaching an agreement. 
OPEC members will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum, which groups producers and consumers, in Algeria from Sept. 26 to 28. Non-OPEC producer Russia is also attending the forum.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will probably revive talks on freezing oil production levels when it meets non-OPEC nations in Algeria, sources have told Reuters.

An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative, underscoring the difficulty for political rivals to forge consensus.

Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on $9.85, or 0.75%, to trade at $1,320.05 a troy ounce by 3:59AM ET (07:59GMT). On Friday, prices slumped to $1,309.20, the lowest since September 1.
The Federal Reserve is not expected to take action on interest rates at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting at 2:00PM ET (18:00GMT) on Wednesday. The central bank will also release its latest forecasts for economic growth and interest rates.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen is to hold what will be a closely-watched press conference 30 minutes after the release of the Fed's statement, as investors look for any change in tone about the economy or future rate hikes.
Speculation about the timing of the Fed's next interest rate hike has been in focus this month following contrasting comments from top Fed officials in recent weeks.
Markets are currently pricing in just a 15% chance of a rate hike this week, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. For December, odds stood at around 54%.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 95.85 early Monday, down 0.2%.
Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.

644,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2016 01:20AM ET</span>",Easy resolution unlikely for contentious Dakota pipeline,"By Catherine Ngai and Ernest Scheyder
NEW YORK/CANNON BALL, NORTH DAKOTA (Reuters) - A potential rerouting of a long-anticipated pipeline at the center of a protest in North Dakota would be a laborious and costly task, possibly delaying a startup by months and provoking further opposition from Native American and environmental groups who were instrumental in halting construction. 
The 1,172-mile (1,886 km) Dakota Access pipeline was slated to start up by the end of the year, transporting more than 470,000 barrels per day of crude oil through four states into Illinois before it hooks up to another pipeline down to Texas.
But in a stunning twist last week, the U.S. Justice Department and other federal agencies intervened to delay construction in what industry and labor representatives called an ""unprecedented"" move. 
The halt on the $3.7 billion project was the result of a groundswell of protest from Native American tribes and environmentalists, some of whom now are vowing to continue the fight until the project is permanently suspended. 
While there are a few options for rerouting the line, most still cross either culturally important lands to Native Americans or large waterways. The more extensive a reroute, the more likely it is that regulatory obstacles crop up. 
""We're entering unchartered waters if a reroute happens at this stage and I can't think of another example of a case where this has happened,"" said Afolabi Ogunnaike, a senior analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. ""Should a reroute take place, there are some major challenges."" 
North Dakota's governor, Jack Dalrymple, told Reuters on Friday that he hoped regulators would give the go-ahead for construction to resume shortly. If that does not happen, an alternative solution does not appear to be easy to come by.
Energy Transfer Partners (N:ETP), the company constructing the line, declined to comment. It had said it is committed to completing the project.
The protest is concentrated in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, near Lake Oahe, a large and culturally-important reservoir located on the Missouri River in central southern North Dakota, where the line was supposed to cross. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers now needs to decide whether it correctly followed the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other federal laws. If they did not, the permit process may need to be restarted, which could take at least 120 days. It is unclear when the NEPA review will be finished. 
The other option -- rerouting the pipeline -- also presents substantial challenges. The surrounding land where the pipeline could cross has a number of national parks or wetlands, commercial and residential uses, or Native American reservations. 
An early proposal involved sending the pipeline from the Bakken shale, where more than a million barrels of oil is produced daily, a bit further north and crossing the Missouri north of the state capital of Bismarck. The current crossing is about 30 miles south of the state capital. http://tmsnrt.rs/2cqkRJ7
""Knowing that the destination of the pipeline is to the east and looking at where the majority of the oil is sourced from, at some point, you have to cross the Missouri River,"" said Eric Hansen, director of environmental services at Westwood Professional Services, a surveying and engineering firm that works in North Dakota.
Activists have said they will continue their protest, fearing damage to the water supply in the event of a leak, though there are many pipelines in the United States that carry fuel under waterways.
""No one can live without water. We just want this to stop. We won't leave until it does,"" said Valerie Eagle Shield, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, the Native American tribe whose lands would be directly affected. 
Energy Transfer Partners preferred the more southerly route eventually decided upon because it was 11 miles shorter and would have less impact on the land, according to a U.S. Army Corps environmental assessment from July. It also cost $23 million less than the first proposed pipeline route. 
The path with fewest obstacles, experts say, is even further north, heading from the small town of Stanley, located in the Bakken, due east, avoiding the Missouri River altogether. 
However, that would require substantial changes and new state and federal permits, and would make it difficult to gather oil from the Bakken, which is not an issue for the current pipeline path. The state and federal regulatory review for the current pipeline took more than two years, according to North Dakota officials. 
""A permitting process is quite complicated,"" Hansen said. ""As they come up with alternatives, they'll have similar issues to face and re-permitting for any reroutes."" 
In addition, winter is coming, which will make construction a challenge if the situation is not resolved. 
Meanwhile, protesters, emboldened by their success, are prepared to take their opposition into the cold winter months, while locals in a section of the line in Iowa are also stepping up their pressure. 

""This is a large issue, and why expedite it when we have to sit down and consider the ways to move forward. Why rush?"" said Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, in Fort Yates, North Dakota.

646,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2016 10:20PM ET</span>",Struggling U.S. wheat sector cheers trade action against China,"By Karl Plume and Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. wheat farmers, struggling to make money as prices sink and global supplies swell, could be the main beneficiaries if Washington wins a case it brought last week against China over an estimated $100 billion in domestic grain market supports.
On Tuesday, U.S. trade officials said they would file a case at the World Trade Organization (WTO) against China over allegations that aggressive pricing supports prompted Chinese farmers to overproduce corn, wheat and rice, fuelling a global crop glut and depressing world prices.
This is the latest salvo in fraught trade relationships between the world's leading agricultural producers.
More than half of the Obama administration's 23 complaints to the WTO have been against China and the two countries are also embroiled in bilateral trade deal discussions and a Chinese investigation into alleged dumping of animal feed grains by U.S. producers.
The U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) announcement comes less than two months before a presidential election in the United States and with a debate over the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement looming.
China came under scrutiny last year from consultants commissioned by U.S. farm and trade groups in 2011 to look into exporting issues. Subsidies in China were ""the biggest problem, even though there were serious problems with some of the other countries,"" said Craig Thorn, a partner at the consulting firm, DTB Associates.
With that conclusion in hand, U.S. farm groups began to push the USTR more actively to open a case into trade with China, Thorn said. DTB provided U.S. officials with its analysis.
The trade groups that funded DTB's research included U.S. Wheat Associates, an industry group that promotes exports, along with the U.S. Grains Council and USA Rice.
WHEAT IN FOCUS
U.S. Wheat Associates then funded an additional study from Iowa State University to look at the economic impact of China's subsidies. That estimated that if the subsidies were removed, the United States would produce nearly 1 million tonnes more wheat by 2022 and export almost 1.5 million tonnes more to China. Beijing's program led to at least $650 million in lost revenue for U.S. farmers last year, the study found.
""China is huge in everything and Chinese policy has enormous impacts for the U.S. The potential benefits to the U.S. of minor policy changes in China are enormous,"" said Iowa State University economist Dermot Hayes, who conducted the analysis.
While the U.S. allegations cover corn and rice as well as wheat, China has already reformed its corn policy and rice exports were never a major part of U.S. agricultural income.
It is wheat that is now causing most pain in America's farming heartland. U.S. wheat prices are at decade lows and some farmers could face losses next year of $55 an acre. In the coming weeks, they are likely to plant the fewest winter wheat acres in a century..
The USTR's case at the WTO could take 18 months to resolve, Thorn said. But while there will be no short-term fix, it could help turn the tide for those farmers who survive, said Dalton Henry, vice president of policy at U.S. Wheat Associates.
""By starting to take action now, it ensures that in 12 or 18 months when we finally have a ruling and some resolution to these policies, it will make a difference then,"" he said.
Traders and industry analysts, however, question how the United States, which has ceded its dominance in wheat over the past two decades to Russia and the European Union, would recapture market share.

""I do not think it makes any difference. The wheat market ... is all about price,"" said Dan Basse, president of AgResource Co.

ALGIERS (Reuters) - OPEC members may call an extraordinary meeting to discuss oil prices if they reach consensus at an informal gathering in Algiers this month, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said during a visit to Algeria, the country's state news agency APS reported on Sunday.
Barkindo said he was optimistic about the meeting in Algeria on Sept. 26-28. He has previously said discussions in Algiers will be consultations and no major decisions will be made during talks with OPEC and non-OPEC producers.
""The informal gathering was proposed as a move to having an extraordinary meeting with the aim of taking decisions to stabilize the market,"" Barkindo said.
Algeria's Energy Minister Noureddine Bouterfa last week said there was a consensus among OPEC and non-OPEC members about the need to stabilize the oil market, and has been pushing for a price around $50 to $60 a barrel.
""Algeria has a proposal for participants in the Algiers meeting. Consultations with our partners show there is a consensus around the need to stabilize the market. That is already a positive,"" Bouterfa said.

It was not immediately clear whether this commitment is separate from the bank's plan announced in May to lend 3 trillion yuan for poverty reduction via agricultural investments.
The move reported on Sunday also aims to increase the agriculture industry's efficiency and foster rural income growth. 
The Agricultural Development Bank of China will be responsible for managing financial services, including offering financial products and setting interest rates, said Xinhua.
Chinese state-owned company ChemChina earlier this month extended its offer to buy Swiss pesticides and seeds group  Syngenta  (S:SYNN) for $43 billion, a deal which sparked food security concerns in the U.S., though it later cleared regulatory hurdles there.

BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - A Libyan force ousted a week ago from key oil ports counter attacked on Sunday, taking back control of Es Sider terminal and triggering clashes near Ras Lanuf port, a spokesman for the force, Ali al-Hassi, and a port worker said.
Es Sider and Ras Lanuf were among four ports seized by forces loyal to eastern commander Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) on Sept. 11-12 from a Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) faction led by Ibrahim Jathran.
Control of the ports remained unclear though with the LNA saying it repelled PFG forces at one port. But the fighting came as the state-run National Oil Corporation prepared to restart oil exports at the ports that have been closed for nearly two years by clashes among rival armed factions.
A spokesman for a guard force loyal to the LNA, Miftah Magariaf, said Jathran's PFG had been repelled from Ras Lanuf with the help of LNA air strikes and that LNA-aligned forces were preparing to recapture Es Sider.
An LNA official said there was a fire at a tank in Es Sider.
The LNA's seizure of the ports took place as the Muslim holiday of Eid was starting and faced little resistance, with a senior tribal leader calling on Jathran's men to switch allegiances.
After moving into Es Sider, Ras Lanuf, Zueitina and Brega, the LNA said it was handing over control of the terminals to the National Oil Corporation (NOC) so that exports could resume.
Jathran had long blockaded the ports of Es Sider, Ras Lanuf and Zueitina, and a recent deal between him and the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli showed little sign of progress.
On Thursday, the NOC announced it was lifting ""force majeure"" contractual clauses at the blockaded ports and that exports would restart immediately at Zueitina and Ras Lanuf.
It said they would start as soon as possible at Es Sider, and would continue at Brega, which had remained open.

Conflict since Libya's 2011 uprising has reduced its oil output to a fraction of the 1.6 million barrels per day the OPEC member once produced.

""Instability and falling oil prices are harmful to all countries, especially oil producers,"" Rouhani was quoted as saying by SHANA. 
""Tehran welcomes any move aimed at market stability and improvement of oil prices based on justice, fairness and fair quota of all the oil producers,"" the president said, referring to a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC producers in Algeria next week, SHANA said.
Rouhani was speaking to Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa on the sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit in Venezuela on Saturday, SHANA reported.
Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer, has been boosting its oil output after the lifting of Western sanctions in January. Tehran refused to join a previous attempt this year by OPEC and non-members such as Russia to stabilize production, and talks collapsed in April.
OPEC members will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum (IEF), which groups producers and consumers, in Algeria on Sept. 26-28. Non-OPEC producer Russia is also attending the forum.
OPEC will probably revive talks on freezing oil production levels when it meets non-OPEC nations in Algeria, sources have told Reuters.
Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed this month to cooperate in oil markets, saying they could limit future output. 

However, on Saturday, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo appeared to play down suggestions of a major agreement by saying the Algiers meeting would be an informal meeting for consultations and not for decision making, Algerian state news agency APS reported.

(Reuters) - Colonial Pipeline Co said on Saturday it resumed repairing a leak on a key U.S. gasoline line on Friday afternoon, but pump prices continued to rise in the southeast as several states took emergency action to get fuel to filling stations more easily.
Colonial shut its main gasoline and distillate lines that run from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast on Sept. 9 after a leak was discovered in Shelby County, Alabama. The damaged Line 1 can carry 1.2 million barrels of gasoline per day and runs from Houston to Greensboro, North Carolina.
The distillate line has been since reopened and parts of the gasoline line are operating as well, but shipments have been slowed due to the pipeline damage, and that is already causing retail gasoline prices to rise. New York-traded gasoline futures have soared 9 percent since the shutdown.
Colonial had to temporarily halt repair work due to vapors at the site of the leak but said Friday it was projected to have the line restarted at some point next week.
It also said it is continuing to explore alternatives, including a temporary line that would circumvent the leak.
Meanwhile, retail prices continued to spike on Saturday, according to motorists' advocacy group AAA, and states, including Tennessee and North Carolina, joined others in temporarily waiving rules related to fuel transport to allow faster delivery of gasoline to filling stations.
The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline jumped 6 cents overnight to $2.199 in Georgia and rose nearly 5 cents to $2.063 in Tennessee, according to the AAA on Saturday.
""This is a problem that could grow as long as supply or shipments from Colonial aren’t enough to keep pace with demand,"" said Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com in Chicago.
On Friday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency waived certain requirements for summer-grade gasoline along the Colonial system from Mississippi to New Jersey, to allow the company to maximize its ability to ship gasoline.
On Friday, Colonial increased its estimate of the volume of the spill to a range of 6,000-8,000 barrels from a previous estimate of 6,000 barrels.
The Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) issued a corrective action order late on Friday listing a number of requirements that need to be met by Colonial in order to restart Line 1 completely, including a 'restart plan'.
The full restart of Line 1 will require federal approval and gasoline has flowed beyond the area initially identified, into a holding pond, PHMSA said.
(This story has been refiled to change reference in paragraph 4 to expected restart of pipeline to sometime next week, instead of Thursday)

Algeria's energy minister has said there is a consensus among OPEC and non-OPEC producers about the need to stabilize the oil market to support prices.
""It will be an informal meeting, it is not a meeting for making decisions,"" Barkindo said during a visit to Algiers, according to APS agency, referring to an energy conference between Sept. 26 and Sept. 28.
""We met in June, it is September now and a lot of things happened between the two dates,"" he said.
His comments appeared to play down suggestions of a major decision at the Algiers meeting where Russia, Iran and other major oil producers were due to meet on the sidelines.
Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed this month to cooperate in oil markets, saying they could limit future output. That pushed up prices on the view in markets that the two top oil producers would be working together to tackle oversupply.
Several OPEC producers have called for an output freeze to rein in the glut, which arose as supplies from high-cost producers such as the United States soared. A price collapse in the last two years has hit the revenues of major producers.
OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, has also signaled willingness to cooperate as it faces such pressures.

But any deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producer Russia would be the first in 15 years. Moscow agreed to cut output in tandem with OPEC at the turn of the millennium, although Russia never followed through on that promise.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Colonial Pipeline Co aims to restart a key U.S. gasoline line by Thursday after delays to repair a leak boosted fuel prices, but analysts expect some motorists to feel the sticker shock for longer.
Colonial, the largest U.S. refined products pipeline system, last Friday shut its main gasoline and distillate lines that run from the Gulf Coast refining hub to the East Coast, after the leak was discovered in Shelby County, Alabama. 
Greg Robinson, the head of Alabama's Emergency Management Agency, said on Friday Colonial told him it hoped to get the pipeline up and running by Thursday. 
Gasoline futures (RBc1) have soared 9 percent in the past week mainly on the closure while prices at the pump in certain states started to spike on Friday due to the ongoing partial shutdown of the vital artery that flows 1.2 million barrels per day of gasoline and other products.
The company has restarted operations at some parts of its gasoline pipeline at reduced rates, and is also pumping fuel on its distillate line, which has been completely restarted.
The restart of the gasoline line was pushed to next week because of gasoline vapors at the site, the company said. Colonial said it would begin excavation operations on Friday afternoon to repair the affected section.
Colonial said it was also considering constructing a temporary segment of pipeline around the leak site. 
On Friday, the company increased its estimate of the volume of the spill to a range of 6,000-8,000 barrels from a previous estimate of 6,000 barrels.
The Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) issued a corrective action order late on Friday listing a number of requirements that need to be met by Colonial in order to restart Line 1 completely, including a 'restart plan'. 
The full restart of Line 1 will require federal approval and gasoline has flowed beyond the area initially identified, into a holding pond, PHMSA said. A colonial spokesman said the company was still reviewing the PHMSA order. ""Like PHMSA, we are focused on safety and committed to ensuring the integrity of the pipeline,"" he said in an email.  STICKER SHOCK The outage is expected to hit the East Coast and Southeast markets the most, as they rely heavily on Line 1 which brings gasoline from Houston to Greensboro, North Carolina, and on another line that ends in Linden, New Jersey.  The six states most likely to be affected are Georgia, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee, traders and analysts said.  Georgia and Alabama declared a state of emergency on Thursday to allow easier road transportation of fuel by road. Regular gasoline in Georgia rose to $2.136 a gallon on Friday from $2.108 on Thursday, while in Tennessee it rose more than 1 cent to $2.014, AAA said.  ""You're looking at a lot of terminals that are running pretty tight on gasoline supply and ... it's becoming an issue where motorists are starting to feel it with their wallets,"" said Patrick DeHaan, petroleum analyst at Gasbuddy. ""The immediate concern is availability in these areas, but even after the pipeline is fully restored, you still have racks and terminals that are trying to beef up their inventory to pre-outage levels and that's going to be a struggle."" 
While the supply disruption led to increased buying for prompt gasoline futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange, it also helped to boost the profit for refining crude into gasoline, with the so-called gasoline crack <1RBc1-Clc1> soaring nearly 18 percent to a three-month high. [O/R]

""Obviously we are going to use this meeting to build consensus,"" Del Pino told reporters, saying leaders from OPEC nations from the Gulf to Ecuador would be present at the 120-nation bloc's meeting on Margarita island.
""The focus for the consensus is Algeria, where we hope to reach important stabilization accords to obtain a fair price for hydrocarbons that all producer countries are seeking,"" he said in comments at a pro-government march carried on state television.
Algeria is hosting meetings of the International Energy Forum and OPEC on Sept. 26-28.
Price hawk Venezuela, which has the largest oil reserves in the world, has been one of the worst-hit countries by the fall in crude prices, which has left its economy is in crisis. 
Del Pino said he had visited Margarita and seen that opposition hopes the Non-Aligned Movement summit would be a failure, making President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government look weak and isolated, were being dashed.
""It's another failure for the opposition, who were trying to present a non-existing image of the country, aided by unpatriotic international media trying to create a view of Venezuela like they did in Libya, in Iraq,"" he said. 
""And we know what happened there.""
Despite the government's upbeat projection of the summit, only one head of state - Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe - had arrived by midday Friday for the leaders' meetings scheduled for Saturday and Sunday. 

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was expected to fly into Margarita, along with Latin American leftist leaders from Bolivia and Ecuador, but overall turnout could be a record low for the Cold War-era group.

Benchmark Brent crude futures fell below the $46-a-barrel mark, trading down 1.7 percent at $45.79 a barrel, down 80 cents, at 1045 GMT. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were down 73 cents, or 1.7 percent, at $43.18 a barrel, a two-week low.

Iran is nearing its pre-sanctions crude oil export levels after a source familiar with the country's tanker loading schedules said the third-biggest OPEC producer had raised exports to more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in August.
Iran's August crude exports, excluding condensate, roughly doubled from a year ago to 2.11 million bpd, the source said, based on data compiled from tanker loading schedules.
Much of Iran's fresh output has found a home in Asia and Europe. India's daily oil imports from Iran rose to the highest in at least 15 years in August, according to trade sources and shipping data.
Austria's OMV said on Friday it had taken delivery of an Iranian crude oil spot delivery in Italy, its first cargo from Iran since 2012.
There are also signs of a return of output from Nigeria and Libya, two countries whose crude exports have been hampered by conflict and unrest.

SINGAPORE/TOKYO (Reuters) - Iran's August crude oil exports jumped 15 percent from July to more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd), according to a source with knowledge of its tanker loading schedule, closing in on Tehran's pre-sanctions shipment levels of five years ago. 
The No. 3 OPEC producer has more than doubled its crude exports, excluding the ultra light oil condensate, since December. Economic sanctions targeting Iran's disputed nuclear program were lifted in January, and it has been battling since then to regain market share lost to other Middle East producers over the previous four years. 
The strong demand for Iran's crude in Asia and Europe has enabled it to raise its oil output to just over 3.8 million bpd as of this month, still shy of the 4 million bpd level Tehran says is a precondition for discussing output limits with Saudi Arabia and Russia. 
Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia are expected to meet during the International Energy Forum in Algeria over Sept. 26-28 to discuss a possible output freeze to stabilize oil prices (LCOc1) (CLc1) that are still down around 60 percent since mid-2014. 
""The only way for producers to maximize their revenues in a low oil price environment to meet budget requirements is to raise production,"" said Victor Shum, an oil analyst at consultancy IHS. ""So there is unlikely to be any supply deal ... in late September,"" he said. 
""We can expect Iran to continue to raise production."" 
August crude exports from Iran excluding condensate roughly doubled from a year ago to 2.11 million bpd, the source said, based on data compiled from tanker loading schedules. 
The crude exports have climbed from 1.9 million bpd in June and 1.83 million bpd in July, the schedules showed. 
Iran's August exports are the highest since January 2012, boosted by record purchases from the world's third-largest oil importer India and a 48 percent jump that brought European sales to 630,000 bpd, tanker loadings for last month also showed. 
Other sources who track Iran's shipping data or who are familiar with its tanker loadings have slightly different figures for Iran's crude exports in August, but still show a near doubling since January. 
For countries like Iran that do not report official trade data, counting tankers is the primary means of estimating their oil trade, although counts may vary from tracker to tracker. 
Details on condensate loadings for August remain unclear. But if shipments of the ultra light oil were steady with this year's average of nearly 310,000 bpd, the total crude and condensate exports last month would be this year's highest at 2.41 million bpd, still short of average pre-sanctions exports of 2.5 million to 2.6 million bpd in 2011, according to figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
Iran's crude exports excluding condensate to Asia in August were 1.48 million bpd, up from 1.40 million bpd in July and roughly steady to this year's previous peak in April. 
Loadings headed for India reached a likely record of nearly 600,000 bpd last month, according to data stretching back at least 15 years, up 150,000 bpd from July, and topping 564,000 bpd loaded for China. 
Japanese loadings were nearly 230,000 bpd, compared with about 92,000 bpd for South Korea. 
Iranian oil was also loaded for Turkey, Greece, and Spain, and exports to Italy more than doubled from the previous month to 87,000 bpd, according to the schedules. 
To further boost its exports, Iran expects to complete the building of a terminal by year-end for a new grade.

LONDON (Reuters) - The price of oil has been caught in one of its most volatile couple of weeks in months after OPEC and rival Russia hinted they may discuss a possible output freeze, as demand slows and a global surplus becomes more entrenched. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum in Algiers in two weeks' time. The pressure is mounting on both sides to not only freeze output, but possibly even cut it.
(For a graphic on OPEC vs non-OPEC output click http://tmsnrt.rs/2ctYZNY)
Whatever the rival factions decide, one producer has managed to top them all in terms of production growth over the last five years and will never be likely to join in any group efforts to control supply. And that is the United States.
Since 2010, thanks to the boom in shale oil production, the United States has witnessed more growth in daily output than any other major producer. 
U.S. oil output is around 2.87 million barrels per day higher now than it was six years ago, compared with an increase of 2.47 million bpd from Saudi Arabia and a rise of 1.9 million bpd from Iraq.
In fact, the increase in U.S. production is only just above the collective increase for the whole of OPEC, which comes in at around 3.15 million bpd.
""If OPEC were to cut its production in Algiers, or really freeze its production, then prices would rise, and what producer would benefit the most rapidly from those high prices? It would be the U.S.. We would be back soon enough in a situation where the U.S. will move toward its previous boom-rate of growth and therefore start absorbing market share again,"" Wood Mackenzie analyst Ann-Louise Hittle said.
""It’s another reason why it's difficult for OPEC to agree to a freeze"" she said. ""The U.S., especially now that it can export crude, is a global threat to market share, it’s not just a threat indirectly through product exports any more.""
In November 2014, OPEC ditched its policy of restraining supply to support the price of oil, which has fallen by more than 40 percent since then to around $46 a barrel (LCOc1).
Increases in the likes of Saudi Arabia or Iraq have been countered by losses in Libya and Nigeria or Venezuela, while Iran is just about approaching output levels registered prior to the introduction of Western sanctions in response to Tehran's nuclear program that were lifted in January 2016.
Russia, the world's largest producer, has managed to add around 550,000 bpd to its daily output in this time and although Energy Minister Alexander Novak has said a freeze would ""help markets"", enforcing such a limit could prove tricky.
""The structure of the U.S. oil industry and the high number of players involved in U.S. crude production would simply not allow for a freeze,"" JBC Energy senior analyst Alexander Poegl said.

""How would you limit production growth, as there is no provision for the government to enforce this?"" Poegl said. ""This is the same argument Russia has used in the past, to a certain extent, although in Russia, where you have a limited amount of players that are highly connected to politics, it is potentially still easier than in the U.S.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday appeared to weigh into a debate over a controversial U.S. biofuels program with a proposal that would back the position of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, one of his wealthiest backers.
In a factsheet on economic policy, the Trump campaign slammed a system of buying and selling biofuel blending credits that it said was bankrupting smaller oil refiners. 
The system is a central part of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the federal program that requires fuel sold in the United States to contain a minimum volume of biofuels, such as ethanol.
The comments were later removed from the Trump campaign website. A Trump spokesman said an incorrect version of the factsheet was temporarily placed online. He said Trump remains committed to the Renewable Fuel Standard.
It was unclear whether the comments reflected a changed stance from Trump on the country's more than decade-old RFS program, which he has previously voiced support for.
But they echoed the position of Icahn, who recently called on federal regulators to level the playing field in the credits system to favor independent refiners like  CVR Energy Inc  (N:CVI), in which Icahn is the majority shareholder.
Icahn's office did not return an email and call when asked to comment.
""These regulations will give Big Oil an oligopoly by destroying the small to mid-size refineries,"" the factsheet on Trump's economic policies said.
""These requirements have turned out to be impossible to meet and are bankrupting many of the small and midsize refineries in this country,"" it added. 
The comments underscored a growing schism within the oil sector pitting large oil companies against independent oil refiners. It also touches on a debate between the interests of Big oil and Big Corn, which strongly backs the mandated use of ethanol in fuels and the credit system to make it work. 
The RFS has hurt independent refiners, who do not always have the ability to mix biofuels into their gasoline and diesel before they send it to gas stations. To sell their gasoline without the required biofuel content, they have to buy credits from oil companies that have blended the fuels.
Those credits have cost the companies billions of dollars, and 2016 looks set to be the most expensive on record to buy the credits, known as RINs.Philadelphia Energy Solutions Inc  said last week that it plans to slash benefits and reduce staff, citing the high cost of buying RINs as one of the principal reasons it needed to make the cuts.
Independent refiners are pressing environmental regulators for changes to the program that could increase the amount of credits the larger companies need, industry sources have said.

For its part, Big Oil favors a repeal of the whole program, rather than a tweak that may land it with increased costs. Biofuels advocates also are against a change to the program.

Natural gas for delivery in October on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 1.1 cents, or 0.38%, to trade at $2.878 per million British thermal units by 10:33AM ET (14:33GMT). Futures were at around $2.838 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 62 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 9, below expectations for an increase of 63 billion.
That compared with a gain of 36 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 74 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 69 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.499 trillion cubic feet, 5.3% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 8.6% above the five-year average for this time of year.
On Wednesday, gas futures surged to a more than two-month high of $2.978 amid forecasts for warmer than normal temperatures across most parts of the continental U.S. in the days ahead.
Despite the recent rally, gains are likely to remain limited as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Unless intense late-summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles could possibly test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

676,By Business Insider,"<span>Sep 15, 2016 04:28AM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia might play hardball with OPEC - here's why,"Recent developments in the OPEC universe have fueled speculation that oil producers might actually be able to agree on something at the informal talks in Algiers, Algeria, set for September 26-28.
Most notably, Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed at the G-20 summit in China last week to  cooperate on oil and create a ""working group"" to stabilize markets —  a move some analysts considered to be ""another indicator of the extreme economic duress that producers are enduring.""
And on the following day, Iran  gingerly offered some support for an oil-production freeze — though it did not actually agree to join one.
But some, however, have argued that there remain several reasons the Saudis might ultimately be opposed to any tangible agreement.
""The  slowdown in Saudi Arabia's economy has prompted the authorities to soften their opposition to a deal to freeze oil output,"" Jason Tuvey, the Middle East economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients.
But ""while a deal is more likely than it was earlier this year, there are several reasons, including ongoing tensions with Iran, to think that the Kingdom will be hesitant to sign up.""
Chief among them:
For what it's worth, Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia's oil minister,  dismissed the need for a production freeze last Monday, leading analysts to wonder whether the Saudi-Russian agreement on oil cooperation would amount to anything.
Plus, the director for international affairs at the state-run National Iranian Oil Co., Mohsen Ghamsari, said last Wednesday that Iran would be ready to decide on capping production only after its output hit pre-sanctions levels, which would amount to just over 4 million barrels a day,  according to Bloomberg. It now produces about 3.8 million barrels a day.
(It's worth noting that Iran's prior hard stance against any production freeze ultimately ended up being a major reason for Saudi Arabia's bailing on the  meeting in Doha, Qatar, back in April.)
""While recent rhetoric suggests a freeze deal has a fighting chance, on-the-ground realities make this outcome far from certain in light of worsening geopolitical tensions within OPEC, too many members production below current and/or aspirational capacity, and demand concerns if prices are driven too high, too fast,"" a Macquarie Research team led by Vikas Dwivedi argued last week.
""Even if a 'freeze' truly materializes, it will provide little fundamental impact,"" Dwivedi added. ""From a longer-term perspective, core OPEC and non-OPEC producers are eyeing $50+ levels to enable future growth.""
""Thus, instead of a meaningful rapprochement among key producers, a 'freeze' may merely represent an opportunity to 'reload' only to resume oil market hostilities.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday after falling around 3 percent in the previous session, supported by an unexpected fall in U.S. crude inventories.
U.S. crude inventories dropped by 559,000 barrels in the week to Sept. 9, defying analysts expectations of a crude build of 3.8 million barrels.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were trading at $46.05 per barrel at 0642 GMT (02:42 a.m. EDT), up 20 cents, or 0.4 percent, from the last settlement. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures (CLc1) were up 6 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $43.64 a barrel.
Crude prices fell about 3 percent for a second straight day on Wednesday following a 4.6 million barrel build in U.S. distillates inventories. The jump was the biggest weekly build since January and put distillate stocks at six-year seasonal highs.
""It's good news at this time of the year to see a draw like that (in crude stocks),"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst for CMC Markets. ""But the market seems to be more concerned at the moment about the possibility of a sharp increase of the supply from Libya.""
Crude prices have fallen by around 8 percent in the last five trading sessions, and concerns are growing over the possibility of returning crude supplies from Libya and Nigeria.
""Both Nigeria and Libya have seen domestic conflicts curb exports. However, both are looking to resume some facilities in the coming weeks,"" Australian bank ANZ said in a note. 
Libya is working to lift force majeure at its port of Zueitina, indicating that Libyan crude exports could start flowing soon.

Expectations that Nigerian crude supplies could also be returning as offers for October-loading Qua Iboe crude have emerged even as force majeure on the grade remains in place.

Mecca province governor Prince Khaled al-Faisal, in remarks likely to be seen as a reference to Iran, added that the orderly conduct of the pilgrimage this year ""is a response to all the lies and slanders made against the kingdom"".
The remarks carried by the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) on Wednesday evening follow an escalating war of words between Shi'ite Muslim Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia since a crush at the annual haj pilgrimage a year ago in which hundreds of pilgrims, many of them Iranians, died.
SPA quoted Prince Khaled as telling journalists his message to the Iranian leadership was ""I pray to God Almighty to guide them and to deter them from their transgression and their wrong attitudes toward their fellow Muslim among the Arabs in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and around the world"".
""But if they are preparing an army to invade us, we are not easily taken by someone who would make war on us."" 
""When we desire, and with the help of God Almighty, we will deter every aggressor and will never relent in protecting this holy land and our dear country. No one can defile any part from our country if any one of us remains on the face of the earth.""
No top Iranian leader has called for war with Saudi Arabia, something neither country wants. 
But last year's haj disaster, and the execution in January of dissident Saudi Shi'ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr, triggered months of scathing Iranian criticism of the kingdom. 
Riyadh broke off relations with Tehran after its embassy there was attacked by Iranians protesting against Nimr's death. Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards promised ""harsh revenge"" for Nimr's death.

Iran blamed the 2015 haj disaster on Saudi incompetence, and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sept. 5 said some of the Iranians who died had been ""murdered"" by Saudi Arabia. He said Muslims should not let Saudi rulers escape responsibility for ""crimes"" he said they had committed in Arab conflicts.

WARRI, Nigeria (Reuters) - A truce in the conflict in Nigeria's oil-producing Niger Delta is in danger of being derailed by anger at the military over the death of an elderly local leader.
The Niger Delta Avengers group, whose attacks on oil pipelines in the southern region crippled crude output earlier this year and pushed Africa's biggest economy into recession, said in August it agreed to a ceasefire.
The government has held out the prospect of holding talks on the grievances of people in the Delta with militant groups which maintain a truce.
But the death last week of Chief Thomas Ekpemupolo, the father of a fugitive former militant leader, could rekindle hostilities.
The octogenarian fell while fleeing an army raid on his home town in May and injured his leg, which had to be amputated two months later, said a spokesman for his son, former militant leader Government Ekpemupolo, known as Tompolo.
Militants launched a wave of attacks at the start of the year to demand a greater share of oil revenues for the swampy region, which produces most of Nigeria's crude but whose residents are mired in poverty.
Security sources say Tompolo has links to those responsible for the attacks, which began shortly after corruption charges were brought against him. He has denied any involvement.
""In a nutshell, (the) government caused the death of my father,"" said Frank Ekpemupolo, another son, raising his voice above the traditional music played through giant speakers at a gathering of 400 mourners at his father's compound in Warri, the largest city in Delta state.
Mourners including community chiefs, politicians and villagers accused troops of harassing people in the fishing communities dotted along the region's waterways.
An Avengers spokesman told Reuters the military was ""harassing poor people of the Niger Delta"". The military denies it, saying troops are merely searching for militants and criminals.
Several new militant groups have sprung up in the last few weeks, each with its own demands, and some have vowed to launch a new wave of attacks.
Community leaders say they are concerned that the government has not contacted militants or unveiled a negotiation team, three weeks after the Avengers said they were ready for the promised talks.
""We haven't been contacted, but we are not worried,"" said the Avengers spokesman.
'GOVERNMENT MUTENESS'
Captain Mark Anthony, a spokesman for defunct militant group the Niger Delta Liberation Force (NDLF), said the ""government's muteness"" since the Avengers announced a ceasefire was creating ""a security concern for everybody"".
""They have only stopped bombing temporarily. It doesn't mean they are tired of bombing,"" he said.
An army offensive was launched in late August against militant camps and led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of 23 others.
Eric Omare, spokesman for the Ijaw Youth Council, which represents one of the region's largest ethnic groups, said statements by President Muhammadu Buhari that militants would be treated like Boko Haram jihadists prompted fears that the offer of talks was a ruse to prepare for a military onslaught.
Tensions in Warri are concentrated along its murky brown waterways - used by fishermen, commuters and thieves stealing crude oil - where fleeting encounters with strangers can end in bloodshed.
Boats slow down and their occupants raise their arms when they encounter naval patrol boats fitted with machineguns.
Fishermen say they fear being mistaken for militants and shot. Gunmen disguised as priests killed three soldiers last month.
An official who did not want to be named said ""arrangements"" were being made to resume dialogue with the militants.
He said the government wanted each militant group to send representatives, rather than acting through intermediaries as in the past.

686,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2016 09:40AM ET</span>","Sliding U.S. export share, trade disputes, set stage for China grains clash","By Dominique Patton and Josephine Mason
BEIJING (Reuters) - On the surface, the timing of the United States' audacious challenge to China's price supports for its grain farmers looks odd.
Farmers in the world's second-biggest economy are currently harvesting their first corn crop in a decade that will not be priced by the government, after Beijing launched efforts to reform its corn policy earlier this year. Furthermore, domestic Chinese corn prices are languishing close to multi-year lows.
But the steady erosion of the U.S. role in the world grain export market, a ballooning global crop glut and the years-long premium that Chinese grains have held over global prices help to explain what compelled the politically influential U.S. farm sector to file its case with the World Trade Organization.
European and U.S. regulators have criticized China's farm policies for years but the country's leaders have prioritized the sector to ensure self-sufficiency in staple food crops and boost rural incomes to address widening inequalities with urban residents. To do that, Beijing has set goals to provide jobs across the farm belt, feed its growing urban population and reduce its dependence on imports. 
The U.S. appears willing to risk ratcheting up tensions in an already-fraught trade relationship as its own farmers grapple with record grain inventories and near 10-year lows in grain prices. 
The two countries, the world's biggest agricultural producers, are already enmeshed in ongoing bilateral trade deal discussions and a Chinese investigation into alleged dumping of animal feed grains by U.S. producers. These tensions are what analyst Rosa Wang at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co Ltd believe sparked the U.S. action.
""It's totally related to the trade relationship,"" said Wang. 
A ruling in the dumping case against U.S. producers of distillers's dried grains with solubles (DDGS), an animal feed made as a byproduct of ethanol production, was expected earlier this week.
FALLING CLOUT
Part of the U.S. pain is explained by an historic shift in trade flows. 
Between 2010 and 2015, the U.S. share of the burgeoning volumes of global exports of corn, wheat and rice shrank by a third as it was crowded out by rivals Brazil, Argentina and Russia, according to data compiled by Reuters. 
Its portion of sales to China fell even faster, dropping by over 40 percent.
An even larger sticking point in the controversy centers on the difference in prices for grains between China and the United States that started to widen in early 2010. 
The United States says the spread distorts world trade and gives Chinese farmers an unfair advantage over competitors.
Spot futures prices of wheat and rice in China averaged more than double their U.S. counterparts in August. Dalian corn prices were an average 1.7 times higher than Chicago corn prices.
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES
Criticizing China's subsidies and forcing Beijing to overhaul its system may have unintended, painful consequences for U.S. farmers, analysts say.
They point to corn as an example.
Domestic Chinese corn shot to premiums over global prices after government help and that created huge opportunities for exporters to sell into China in recent years. In 2015, the country imported 4.7 million tonnes of corn as domestic prices averaged nearly 1,300 yuan ($195) per tonne more than the U.S. benchmark.
But, as China has dismantled its corn stockpiling and decade-old price support program this year, the spread in corn has dropped by roughly 30 percent to around 900 yuan per tonne.
And with that drop China's appetite for foreign corn has collapsed, falling 22 percent through July compared to the same period last year.
Ma Wenfeng, a senior analyst at Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultant Ltd, said on Wednesday that China's waning import appetite with the ending of the state support system was a bigger worry for the United States. 

""It's because China doesn't support (it's corn farmers anymore)"" that U.S. imports have dropped, he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices firmed on Wednesday after falling by as much as 3 percent in the previous session, as data from an industry group showed a smaller-than-expected build in U.S. crude stockpiles.
The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a crude build of 1.4 million barrels for the week ended Sept. 9, smaller than the 3.8 million barrel rise expected by analysts.

Brent crude futures were trading at $47.34 per barrel at 1021 GMT, up 24 cents from their last settlement.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were up 29 cents at $45.19 a barrel.
""Long suffering oil bulls will now turn nervously to the U.S. EIA’s commercial crude inventory numbers,"" OANDA senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley said. ""It was an unexpected undershoot in these numbers last week that set off the rally in crude last week.""
Crude prices tumbled on Tuesday after the International Energy Agency (IEA) said slowing oil demand growth amid growing inventories and supplies could signal that the market will be oversupplied at least through the first half of 2017.
Commerzbank said in a note the delay in rebalancing is largely due to a rise in production from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and that the market would be balanced already if OPEC maintained its production at May's levels. 
""Rather than talking about capping oil production as it was planning to do at the end of September, OPEC would be better advised to think about reversing the production growth of recent months,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Carsten Fritsch said.
OPEC members are due to meet informally in Algeria this month on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum (IEF). Russia is also expected to attend the IEF.
Gains in crude prices could also be capped by rising crude exports from Libya after the country's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Tuesday it would immediately start working to resume crude exports from ports seized in recent days by forces loyal to eastern commander Khalifa Haftar.

Libyan production could be raised to 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) from about 290,000 bpd within a month, further adding to the global crude supply glut.

Natural gas for delivery in October on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to an intraday peak of $2.942 per million British thermal units, just below a two-month high of $2.944.
It was last at $2.897 by 10:39AM ET (14:39GMT), down 1.8 cents, or 0.62%.
A day earlier, gas futures surged 11.8 cents, or 4.22%, after updated weather forecasting models pointed to very warm late summer temperatures into next week, boosting demand expectations for the cooling fuel.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build of approximately 66 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 9.
That compares with a gain of 36 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 74 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 69 billion cubic feet.
Total gas in storage currently stands at 3.437 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 5.7% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 8.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Despite the recent rally, gains are likely to remain limited as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Unless intense late-summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles could possibly test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell on Tuesday after a series of predictions on demand growth that pointed to the global overhang of unused inventories persisting for much longer than previously expected.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) said that a sharp slowdown in global oil demand growth, coupled with ballooning inventories and rising supply, means the crude market will be oversupplied at least through the first six months of 2017. 
That view marked a change from the agency's forecast a month ago, when it forecast supply and demand broadly in balance over the rest of this year and expected inventories to fall swiftly. 
The IEA's latest comments follow a surprisingly bearish outlook from OPEC on Monday.

Upbeat Chinese data on industrial output growth for August failed to lift oil prices as the crude market remained in profit-taking mode, traders said.

The IEA had previously expected the market to show no surplus in the second half of this year.
In its monthly report released earlier in the session, the IEA sharply cut its forecast for global oil demand for this year and the next amid what it called “wobbling” Asian demand.
The Paris-based agency downgraded its global oil demand predictions by about 100,000 barrels a day for this year to 1.3 million barrels a day. It also reduced the forecasts by about 200,000 barrels a day in 2017.
The IEA's latest comments follow a surprisingly bearish outlook from OPEC on Monday.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for November delivery fell by more than 2% to hit a daily low of $47.18 a barrel. It was last at $47.70 by 9:35AM ET (13:35GMT), down 62 cents, or 1.28%.
Elsewhere, crude oil for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange slumped 87 cents, or 1.88%, to $45.42 a barrel.
Market players shifted their focus to weekly data from the U.S. on stockpiles of crude and refined products.
Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (20:30GMT) later on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday.
Meanwhile, oil traders continued to weigh prospects that major oil producing nations will freeze output to support the market when they meet later this month.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia and other big Middle East crude exporters, will meet non-OPEC producers led by Russia at informal talks in Algeria between September 26 and 28.
Chances that the upcoming meeting would yield any action to reduce the global glut appeared minimal, according to market experts. Instead, most believe that oil producers will continue to monitor the market and possibly postpone freeze talks to the official OPEC meeting in Vienna on November 30.
An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative, underscoring the difficulty for political rivals to forge consensus.

Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on $2.25, or 0.17%, to trade at $1,327.85 by 8:50AM ET (12:50GMT). A day earlier, futures shed $8.90, or 0.67%.
In a speech on Monday, Fed Governor Lael Brainard warned against raising interest rates too quickly. The comments came after Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Friday that low interest rates are increasing the chance of overheating the U.S. economy.
Markets are pricing in a 15% chance of a rate hike at the Fed's September 20-21 meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. For December, odds stood at around 55%.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
Also on the Comex, copper futures gained 0.6 cents, or 0.29%, to $2.106 a pound, as investors digested the latest round of Chinese economic data.
China's factory output and retail sales grew faster than expected in August, easing concerns over the health of the world's second-largest economy.
Industrial production rose at an annualized rate of 6.3% in August, beating expectations for a 6.1% increase, the General Administration of Customs said on Tuesday.
Retail sales also handily beat expectations, with growth accelerating to 10.6% from 10.2% a month earlier, while fixed asset investment, which tracks construction activity, rose 8.1% last month, above forecasts for an increase of 8.0%.
The Asian nation is the world’s largest copper consumer, accounting for almost 40% of world consumption last year.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2016 07:10AM ET</span>",Global oil outlook darkens more quickly; surplus stubborn,"By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - The global oil market will show a surplus into next year, as an abrupt deterioration in demand growth meets rising supply, pushing world inventories to yet another record high and confounding the previous expectations of leading energy agencies.
The International Energy Agency on Tuesday forecast global supply would outpace demand well into next year, marking an about-face from its assessment just one month ago that the market would essentially show no surplus for the remainder of this year.
Similarly, a monthly report from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Monday showed the world's largest producers expect their non-OPEC rivals to pump even faster, suggesting a hefty surplus may be on the cards in 2017.
""Our forecast in this month's report suggests that this supply-demand dynamic may not change significantly in the coming months. As a result, supply will continue to outpace demand at least through the first half of next year,"" the IEA said.
Global refinery runs are expected to grow at their slowest pace in at least a decade this year, which will curb appetite for crude oil, just as inventories across the OECD rose to a fresh record high of 3.111 billion barrels, the report said.
""With our more pessimistic outlook for the second half of 2016 refining activity and revisions to crude supply, the expected draws in the third quarter of 2016 are now lower, while the build in the fourth quarter of 2016 is higher,"" the IEA said.
Global demand growth is slowing at a faster pace than the group initially predicted. The IEA left its forecast for demand growth for 2017 unchanged from its prediction in June at 1.2 million barrels per day, but cut its forecast for 2016 consumption growth to 1.3 million bpd, from 1.4 million.
""The key demand change in this report is the erosion of 300,000 bpd from the third quarter of 2016's global demand estimate, and the resulting removal of 100,000 bpd from the net 2016 forecast,"" the IEA said.
Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) fell by around 2 percent on Tuesday to $47.30 a barrel, still showing a 70-percent gain so far this year, but about half where it was two years ago. 
Despite oil's collapse and resulting investment cuts, global oil production is still expanding, although nowhere near the breakneck pace of 2015. High-cost OPEC producers have been hit particularly hard. 
However, the loss has been more than made up for by OPEC. Saudi Arabia and Iran have each raised oil output by over 1 million barrels a day since late 2014 when OPEC shifted strategy to defend market share rather than price. 
OPEC forecast demand for its oil will average 32.48 million bpd in 2017, down 530,000 bpd from its previous forecast.
""It seems the situation has deteriorated strongly in the eyes of OPEC as well as the IEA,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) head of commodities strategy Eugen Weinberg said.
"".. That we are in the third quarter of 2016 and we won’t see the 'balancing-out' over the next six months is definitely a major change,"" he said.

Near-record OPEC output, and higher supply from outside, could make it harder for OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and rival Russia to come up with steps to support the market. Producers are expected to meet in Algeria on the sidelines of the Sept. 26-28 International Energy Forum.

704,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2016 02:22AM ET</span>",Libyan commander's seizure of oil ports risks new conflict,"By Aidan Lewis and Ayman al-Warfalli
TUNIS/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Libyan forces loyal to eastern commander Khalifa Haftar said on Monday they had tightened their control over four major oil ports, casting a Western-backed project to unite Libya and revive oil exports into deep uncertainty.
Haftar's forces met little resistance as they seized the terminals at Ras Lanuf, Es Sider, Zueitina and Brega in an operation launched on Sunday, displacing a rival armed faction aligned with the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli.
The advance is the latest power struggle over the OPEC nation's energy assets, after the 2011 fall of Muammar Gaddafi and the chaos that followed left the North African country splintered into rival armed factions.
Haftar opposes the Tripoli government and has resisted its attempts to integrate his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) into unified armed forces. His seizure of the ports risks a response from powerful western brigades allied with the government and a deepening of regional divisions. 
But Tripoli may seek a deal with Haftar, similar to the agreement it struck with the armed faction he has displaced, to restart the oil exports it needs to stave off a financial crisis that could paralyze government operations.
Conflict and political disputes have reduced Libya's oil output and exports to a fraction of the level seen before an uprising toppled late dictator Gaddafi five years ago.
In a statement signaling a willingness to get oil flowing, Haftar's LNA said late on Sunday it would secure the ports to ""return operational responsibility to the National Oil Corporation with a guarantee of non-interference by armed forces in operational activities and exports"".
The GNA's international backers said on Monday that LNA forces should withdraw immediately, that oil infrastructure had to remain under the control of the GNA, and that they would enforce a U.N. Security Council resolution against ""illicit"" oil exports. 
Just a year ago, Libya had two rival governments, one in Tripoli and one in the east, each backed by competing factions of armed brigades and laying claims to the country's oil resources. 
A unity deal brokered by the United Nations, signed by rival factions in December despite opposition from hardliners, was meant to end the divide. As a result of the agreement, the GNA arrived in Tripoli in March, backed by Western powers, to stabilize a country where lawlessness allowed Islamist militants and migrant smugglers to operate across swathes of territory. 
Since then, however, some political and tribal leaders in the east have withheld their support, worried that the new government is a vehicle for opponents in the west. The LNA has strengthened its position, making military gains in and around Benghazi against Islamist-led opponents before taking control of the ports.
'SWIFT LIGHTNING'
Many people in Tripoli and western Libya criticize Haftar as a new dictator in the making, but he has become a political figurehead for many in the east who feel abandoned by the capital.
In seizing the ports, the LNA displaced units of Libya's Petrol Facilities Guard (PFG) led by Ibrahim Jathran, which struck a deal with the GNA in July to end its three-year blockade of the Ras Lanuf, Es Sider and Zueitina terminals.
The LNA took Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, Libya's biggest export terminals, in a dawn operation on Sunday it dubbed ""Swift Lightning"". Clashes broke out in Zueitina, but the LNA said overnight that it had secured that port as well as confirming its control of a fourth port, Brega.
Residents in Zueitina and Brega told Reuters that LNA forces were in control on Monday. 
A commander allied to the LNA said an attempted counter-attack at Ras Lanuf by Jathran loyalists had been blocked on Monday. 
Jathran had lost much local support after switching allegiances to the GNA. There were few casualties during the port seizures as many of his men appeared to have responded to a call from eastern tribal leaders to hand over control peacefully. 
Haftar's forces could face a renewed backlash from Islamist-leaning groups in the east as result of the raids, but they have suffered heavy losses in previous battles with the LNA. 
His opponents in the western city of Misrata could prove the bigger threat. 
Misratan forces are close to finishing a four-month campaign to oust Islamic State from its former North African stronghold of Sirte.
But the campaign has been costly, and Misrata also has to sustain a military presence in several other parts of the west, including Tripoli, where it has provided support for the GNA. 
EASTERN FACTIONS
If the LNA retains military control over the terminals, eastern factions it is allied with could make a fresh attempt to export oil independently from the National Oil Company (NOC) in Tripoli.
But previous efforts to do this through the NOC office in Benghazi and funnel money to an eastern branch of Libya's central bank have been blocked by international opposition. 
Claudia Gazzini, a Libya expert at International Crisis Group, said it was in Haftar's interests to have a working relationship with the NOC. 
""I think this is what he's aiming for – to be the one who reopens the terminals,"" Gazzini said.
Still, any deal between the LNA and the state oil body could face stiff political opposition from anti-Haftar elements in the GNA's leadership, or Presidential Council, which late on Sunday called the attacks an ""unjustified escalation"" that would prolong conflict in Libya.
The GNA's Council consists of nine members who were selected on the basis of Libya's political and geographical divisions and are often divided among themselves. 
The return to the Council of Ali Gatrani, a member representing the east who had suspended his membership for months, opens a potential channel to Haftar and his allies in the east as the government seeks to win their backing.
In the past, however, eastern factions have said they will not join the GNA without greater representation, guarantees over the leadership of the military, and the relocation of the NOC to Benghazi - demands they are likely to press with more confidence now.
""The view of the LNA is that, now they are taking control and making advances, they will want to see an improvement in their funding, they will want to see this reflected economically and politically in their benefit,"" said Mohamed Eljarh, an analyst with the Atlantic Council.

In such a scenario, he said, Misrata leaders could refuse to deal with Haftar, adding: ""There we could really see the faultlines for the division of the country.""

October oil production is set to drop by 61,000 barrels per day to 4.41 million bpd, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's drilling productivity report, the lowest output since March 2014.
The biggest decline was in the Eagle Ford in Texas, which saw a fall of 46,000 bpd to nearly 982,000 bpd. In North Dakota, Bakken oil production is set to drop by some 28,000 bpd to 914,000 bpd. 
While oil prices are trading at less than half of their value from mid-2014, they have recovered from 13-year lows earlier this year, recently even reaching $50 a barrel (LCoc1). That has allowed at least some production declines to be tempered in the Permian, the largest U.S. shale basin by production. 
Permian output from West Texas is set to rise by 22,000 bpd to nearly 2 million bpd, its second monthly increase. 
Total natural gas production, meanwhile, is forecast to decline for an eighth consecutive month in October to 45.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), the lowest level since March 2015, the EIA said.
That would be down about 0.3 bcfd from September, making it the smallest monthly decline since May, it noted.
The biggest regional decline was expected to be in the Eagle Ford, down 0.2 bcfd from September to 5.6 bcfd in October, the lowest level of output in the basin since November 2013, the EIA said.
October output in the Marcellus formation, the biggest U.S. shale gas field, was expected to ease by less than 0.1 bcfd from September to 17.8 bcfd. That would be the eighth monthly decline in a row, falling to the lowest level since December.
Separately, EIA added drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells to its report this month. The report showed total DUCs declined by 34 in August from July to 5,031, the lowest since January 2015.

DUCs in the Permian rose by 38 to 1,348, its highest since at least December 2013, while Eagle Ford DUCs dropped by 36 to 1,261, its lowest since January 2015. In the Marcellus, DUCs fell by 16 to 642, its lowest since at least December 2013.

GENEVA (Reuters) - India has complained to the World Trade Organization about support given to the renewable energy industry in eight U.S. states, the WTO said in a statement on Monday.
The complaint alleges the states of Washington, California, Montana, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Michigan, Delaware and Minnesota prop up their renewables sector with illegal subsidies and domestic content requirements - an obligation to buy local goods rather than imports.
The WTO statement did not give details of the complaint and there was no immediate comment from India's trade ministry. But India has voiced concerns in the past about U.S. support for its solar power industry. 
The race to build national solar capacity and grab a chunk of a new global market has become a major new cause of trade friction between big trading powers. India lost a case at the WTO earlier this year after the United States complained about New Delhi's national solar program.
India has appealed that ruling.
In 2013, India filed questions at the WTO about suspected subsidies in solar programs in four U.S. states - Delaware, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Connecticut - as well as local content requirements in Michigan and California's renewable energy programs.
It was not immediately clear that Monday's complaint was on the same grounds as India's earlier questions.

By filing the complaint, India has triggered a 60-day window for the United States to settle the dispute, after which India could ask the WTO to adjudicate.

LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC raised its forecast of oil supplies from non-member countries in 2017 as new fields come online and U.S. shale drillers prove more resilient than expected to cheap crude, pointing to a larger surplus in the market next year.
Demand for crude from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will average 32.48 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, OPEC said in a monthly report on Monday. That is down 530,000 bpd from the previous forecast.
The prospect of a larger surplus than expected adds to the challenge of OPEC and non-members such as Russia, who are making a renewed attempt to restrain supplies. Oil (LCOc1) is trading at $47 a barrel, half its level of mid-2014, as a supply glut that OPEC hoped cheap oil would banish sticks around.
OPEC revised up its 2016 and 2017 non-OPEC supply forecasts, citing factors including the start up of Kazakhstan's Kashagan oilfield and a lower-than-expected decline in U.S. shale output, and said the immediate outlook was for more production.
""It is expected that there will be higher non-OPEC production in the second half of 2016 compared to the first half,"" OPEC said in the report.
OPEC expects non-OPEC supply to rise by 200,000 bpd in 2017, versus a previously forecast 150,000 bpd decline. The revision is mostly due to Kashagan, OPEC said, as the long-delayed giant field finally starts up. 
On top of that, the forecast for this year was revised up by 180,000 bpd.
OPEC itself kept output near a multi-year high in August, pumping 33.24 million bpd, according to figures OPEC collects from secondary sources, down 23,000 bpd from July's figure, the report said. 
The July figure is the highest since at least 2008, according to a Reuters review of past OPEC reports.
Near-record OPEC output, and higher supply from outside, could make it harder for OPEC and Russia to come up with steps to support the market. Producers are expected to meet in Algeria on the sidelines of the Sept. 26-28 International Energy Forum.
An attempt by producers to agree to a production freeze in April failed as Iran, wanting to boost oil exports that had been restrained by Western sanctions, refused to join and Saudi Arabia insisted all producers took part.
The August output figures in the report at least show no further large supply increases in top OPEC producers. As previously reported, Saudi Arabia told OPEC it reduced output by 40,000 bpd from July's record high of 10.67 million bpd. 
Iran told OPEC it pumped 3.63 million bpd, steady from July's 3.62 million bpd, a slowdown in the rate of growth earlier in the year after the lifting of sanctions in January.
The OPEC report stopped short of predicting when supply and demand would rebalance, although it said signs of higher-than-expected demand in some big consumers would contribute to ""a reduction in the imbalance of market fundamentals"" in coming months"".
At the start of 2016, OPEC expected the rebalancing to happen this year.
With demand for OPEC crude in 2017 expected to average 32.48 million bpd, the report indicates there will be an average surplus of 760,000 bpd if OPEC keeps output steady. Last month's report pointed to a small, 100,000 bpd surplus.

In the report, OPEC made no change to the global demand outlook, predicting demand growth of 1.15 million bpd in 2017.

712,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2016 08:36AM ET</span>",Jobless recovery looms for white-collar U.S. oil workers,"By Ernest Scheyder
SPRING, Texas (Reuters) - Elizabeth Huber lost her job inspecting oilfield pipes nearly 20 months ago and her prospects remain bleak even as oil executives cautiously plot production and budget increases.
Despite crude trading 75 percent above its February lows and energy companies shifting focus from survival to recovery, white-collar jobs in the sector remain as scarce as during the depths of the two-year oil price rout. 
Like many laid-off energy sector specialists, Huber, 58, a metallurgical engineer, hopes this is just another cyclical downturn that will pass.
Yet dozens of interviews with industry veterans, company executives and recruiters suggest this time might be different. 
Recruiters warn that many jobs may not return even when the tentative recovery gains momentum. Job seekers, especially those who have been through several ups and downs and are now nearing retirement age, fear they may get sidelined for good.
Labor statistics seem to justify those fears. Over the past 25 years energy industry employment has closely tracked ups and downs in crude prices.
This year, though, the sector continues to shed jobs even as prices rallied from around $26 per barrel to over $50 in June and have mostly held above $40 since. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2caqb41)
To be sure, at this early stage doubts linger whether the recovery will hold after the slump that wiped out more than 200,000 jobs in the U.S. oil industry and related sectors. The longer such uncertainty persists, the harder it will be for specialists like Huber to return. 
With severance and unemployment money long gone, Huber said she might have no choice but settle for any job that pays the bills.
""I can't afford to wait another year,"" she said at a recent meeting of Energy Job Search Team, a Houston networking event that draws hundreds each week. ""I'm stretching every penny."" 
EXPERTISE LOST
For the industry, that could spell a loss of expertise that will be hard to replace if and when the next boom comes. 
""You're seeing so many older people and experienced people be let go. The experienced people are out,"" said Carlos Pineda, 59, a drilling completions engineer laid off from  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) in January 2016. He said this downturn definitely feels much worse than in 2008 and even in the 1980s.
Even as executives of leading producers, such as EOG Resources Inc (N:EOG) or  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co (N:PXD) have been talking about production and budget increases, that does not translate into more job offers. 
By the end of July, the U.S. energy industry cut nearly 95,000 jobs compared with just under 70,000 a year earlier, according to staffing firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc.
One reason companies are wary of hiring again is the financial hangover after the shale drilling boom. It nearly doubled U.S. oil output in five years, but left many producers with hefty debt payments that current oil prices barely cover.
Tumbling oil prices also forced companies to get leaner quickly by making greater use of data and computer models, upgrading the techniques and streamlining operations. 
Drilling and fracking a new well used to take more than a month; in some cases it now takes half that time, or less, which means fewer drilling crews and specialists.
""There are many people who will never come back to the oil industry,"" said Gladney Darroh, head of energy recruiting firm Piper-Morgan Associates. He said this latest downturn was the worst he had seen in 40 years. 
While many blue-collar workers have already found jobs in construction and other industries, the future looks bleaker for petroleum engineers, geologists and other specialists whose skills do not transfer so easily.
""If you're a petroleum geologist, you don't become a loan executive,"" says Mike Kahn, a recruiter at Lucas Group in Houston.
HANGING ON
Tara Sinclair, senior economic fellow for global jobs site Indeed, says that while search patterns show blue-collar energy workers starting to look for jobs elsewhere after six months, specialists tend to wait longer.
They do not want years of training and experience to go to waste and many have the savings to be patient.
The bad news is that whereas there has been an uptick in blue-collar job postings in the past five months, Indeed figures show that listings of white-collar energy jobs keep falling. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2c2sR78)
Many analysts expect companies to hold off with large-scale hiring until oil prices eclipse $60 a barrel, despite industry concerns that the retiring baby boomer generation will leave a skills gap that may hurt future growth.
Today, companies can raise production by re-deploying idled rigs and completing unfinished wells, but recruiters warn later on they may struggle to find specialists they will need to find new deposits and further boost productivity.
""If in two years you need a reservoir engineer with experience, where are you going to find that person? It'll be very difficult,"" said Darroh, the recruiter.
Oilfield services giant  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL), which laid off more than 20,000 workers in the past two years, is playing down such concerns. Mahesh Puducheri, global vice president of human resources, said attractive benefits and pay - often above $100,000 per year - act as strong incentives.
""Even though people would leave to go to another industry, the moment oil and gas pricing starts to pick up, we expect them to come back to our industry,"" he told Reuters. ""We've never had issues attracting people back.""
Others are less confident and consider shortages of skilled labor as a long-term risk. Yet their message is they have to live with that risk while market conditions remain uncertain.

""I can't go hiring people until I'm confident my own customers will have money to spend instead of paying down their debt,"" said Ian Bryant, president of Packers Plus, which supplies parts used in hydraulic fracturing.

U.S. crude was down 112 cents, or 2.44%, to $44.76 on the New York Mercantile Exchange by 0740 ET.
Global benchmark Brent fell 107 cents, or 2.23%, to $46.94 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.
OPEC warned in its monthly report on Monday that oil markets will remain heavily oversupplied well into 2017 as new fields come online and U.S. shale drillers remain resilient in the face of cheap crude.
Non-OPEC supply for 2017 was revised up by 350,000 barrels per day (bpd) to average 56.52 million bpd, an increase on this year.
Demand for crude from OPEC will average 32.48 million bpd in 2017, the organization said, down from the previous forecast of 33.01 million bpd.
Despite robust oil demand growth, the oil market will remain oversupplied this year and next, the report said.
Oil prices had fallen ahead of the report, pressured lower by the stronger dollar and by increasing oil drilling activity in the United States.
The dollar rose against most of the other major currencies on Monday amid renewed expectations for a hike in U.S. interest rates next week.
U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a tenth week last week, according to a report from services company Baker Hughes published on Friday.
Oil prices ended 4% lower on Friday as traders discounted an unexpectedly large drop in U.S. oil stockpiles as the beginning of a broader trend.
Analysts said the unexpectedly large drawdown in inventories came as a tropical storm on the East Coast kept cargoes of oil and fuel from being delivered.
Oil prices have fluctuated in recent weeks amid uncertainty over whether the world’s major oil producers will take steps to curb output when they meet later this month.
Many market participants remain doubtful that talks will result in any agreement aimed at propping up prices."
714,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2016 05:15AM ET</span>",Oil falls as U.S. drills more,"By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell for a second trading day in a row on Monday, after speculators cut their bullish bets by the most in three months last week and U.S. crude drillers added more rigs for a tenth week running.
Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) fell 53 cents on the day to £47.48 a barrel, by 0830 GMT (04:30 a.m. EDT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures (CLc1) fell 66 cents to $45.22 a barrel.
Traders said the price falls on Monday and Friday were a result of increasing oil drilling activity in the United States, which indicated that producers can operate profitably around current levels. 
""The idea that we will continue to bounce off the $50 per barrel handle is proving correct,"" said Matt Stanley, fuel broker, Freight Investor Services (FIS) in Dubai, pointing toward ""the dynamic of shale oil"" as the main reason to have pulled prices back down.
Oil's near six-percent price decline since Sept. 8 partly reverses a 10-percent rally seen early in the month to around $50 per barrel.
Adding to the pressure on the oil price, the dollar rose against the Australian dollar  and most emerging-market currencies, as investors priced in a greater chance of U.S. interest rates rising next week, which forced up bond yields and dented the broader commodities complex.
""From that perspective, we’re getting a bit of a sell-off in oil,"" CMC Markets strategist Jasper Lawler said.
""Given the good run that oil has had, that was maybe the easy trade to take when the dollar was rallying,"" he added. 
When the dollar strengthens, non-U.S. investors tend to cash in on their dollar-denominated assets, such as crude oil.
This correlation was at its most negative in over a month on Monday, meaning the two are more likely to move inversely to one another than at any time since early August.
Expectations of another flood of refined product exports from China later this year added another negative note, as demand in Asia's biggest economy and oil consumer stutters.
Speculative oil traders also became less confident of higher oil prices, cutting their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions for a second consecutive week last week, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.
Traders said they were still eyeing statements regarding a potential freezing of oil output closely, although a broad agreement to meaningfully rein in oversupply was not currently expected.

Even if exporters agree on freezing output around current levels, analysts said that would do little to raise prices as most exporters are pumping out oil at or near record levels, and have adapted to do so at lower prices.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2016 12:10AM ET</span>",U.S. utility solar enjoys building boom in second quarter but residential slows,"(Reuters) - U.S. solar installations rose 43 percent in the second quarter, according to a new report, as sharp gains in large projects for utilities offset slowing growth in residential systems in top solar market California.
The United States installed 2,051 megawatts of photovoltaic solar in the second quarter, according to a report by research firm GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association trade group. Systems for utilities made up 53 percent of the market in the first half of this year thanks to sharply lower system prices that are competitive with fossil fuels and state mandates to source more electricity from renewable sources.
A federal tax credit worth 30 percent of the cost of a solar system has also underpinned the utility market's growth. The credit had been expected to expire at the end of this year, leading to a building boom in 2016. The credit, however, was extended by Congress for five years at the end of last year.
That means 5.7 gigawatts of projects that had been expected to come on line this year will spill over into 2017, the report said. Nearly 8 GW are expected to come online later this year.
Meanwhile, residential solar had its largest quarter ever, installing 650 MW. But growth slowed to 29 percent over the same period last year, a significant drop from the more than 50 percent growth rates the sector has enjoyed annually since 2012.
In California, growth slowed to 19 percent. Throughout 2015, that market had grown more than 50 percent every quarter.
""Fewer early mover customers remain, and this challenge is limiting growth, especially in California,"" the report said. California ""will provide the rest of the U.S. with an important precedent for how rooftop solar can continue to scale in a more mature market.""
Strength in newer state markets like Utah and Texas helped boost the residential market.
Overall solar system pricing fell by up to 7.5 percent during the quarter, but increased competition for customers in the residential market drove up the cost of winning new customers during the quarter. Those costs could continue to rise next quarter, the report said.

The cost of a utility-scale system ranged from $1.17 per watt to $1.30 per watt during the quarter, compared with $3.14 per watt for a residential system. About 65 percent of the cost of a residential system comes from labor, customer acquisition and other non-hardware costs.

722,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2016 06:36AM ET</span>","Native Americans celebrate pause of North Dakota pipeline, vow to fight on","By Dave Thompson
CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - Native Americans protesting construction of a North Dakota oil pipeline near land they consider sacred on Saturday quietly celebrated the U.S. government's decision to pause construction on federally owned land, and vowed to press for a full halt to the project.
On Friday, the Obama administration temporarily halted construction on federal land of the planned pipeline that has angered the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and asked the company behind the project to suspend nearby work.
The move came shortly after a federal judge in Washington rejected a request from Native Americans for a court order to block the project.
The government's action reflected the success of growing protests over the proposed $3.7 billion pipeline crossing four states which have sparked a renewal of Native American activism.
The Standing Rock Sioux, whose tribal lands are a half-mile south of the proposed route, say the pipeline would desecrate sacred burial and prayer sites, and could leak oil into the Missouri and Cannon Ball rivers, on which the tribe relies for water. 
On Saturday, many activists in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, touted the latest victory, but said its temporary nature meant they would not end their protests, echoing Friday statements by Standing Rock Sioux leaders.
""This could go all winter, and into next summer,” said Lance Dorian, spokesman for a group from the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota that has set up camp on the south side of the Cannon Ball River, on Standing Rock land. “We’re in it for the long haul.” 
His tribe had set up big Army-style tents as well as a kitchen.
With prayer and song as well as the occasional drum beat in the background, activists vowed not to leave.
“We won the day,” said environmental activist John Wauthen from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. “There’s a long fight still ahead of us.”
Opposition to the pipeline has drawn support from 200 Native American tribes, as well as from activists and celebrities. 
Speaking from the red carpet at the Toronto International Film Festival world premiere of ""Snowden"" on Friday, actress Shailene Woodley, who has backed efforts to halt the pipeline, lauded the U.S. government's decision.
""It's about damn time,"" she said. ""I'm extremely grateful and I hope that momentum continues to move forward."" 
Dakota Access, subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners LP that is building the pipeline, declined to comment on Saturday.
Brigham McCown, an industry consultant and former head of pipeline regulator U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, said the federal action came ""out of left field"" and was unprecedented.

""We don’t know what the implications are, other than that it's going to have a huge chilling effect on our national ability to move forward with infrastructure projects,"" he said.

State television showed Iranian and Russian officials at launching ceremonies for the 10-year project which will include two power plants with a total capacity of more than 1,000 megawatts after their completion. 
Iran already runs one Russian-built nuclear reactor at Bushehr, its first. Russia signed a deal with Iran in 2014 to build up to eight more reactors in the country.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2016 07:45PM ET</span>","After protests, U.S. halts North Dakota pipeline near tribal lands","By Ruthy Munoz and Dave Thompson
WASHINGTON/BISMARCK, North Dakota (Reuters) - The Obama administration stepped into a dispute on Friday over a planned oil pipeline in North Dakota that has angered Native Americans, appealing for calm while blocking construction on federal land and asking the company behind the project to suspend work nearby.
The move came shortly after U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington rejected a request from Native Americans for a court order to block the project. The government's action reflected the success of growing protests over the proposed $3.7 billion pipeline crossing four states which have sparked a renewal of Native American activism.
""This case has highlighted the need for a serious discussion on whether there should be nationwide reform with respect to considering tribes' views on these types of infrastructure projects,"" the U.S. Departments of Justice, Army and Interior said in a joint statement released minutes after Boasberg's ruling.
Opposition to the pipeline has drawn support from 200 Native American tribes, as well as from activists and celebrities. 
The Standing Rock Sioux, whose tribal lands are a half-mile south of the proposed route, say the pipeline would desecrate sacred burial and prayer sites, and could leak oil into the Missouri and Cannon Ball rivers, on which the tribe relies for water.
On Friday, the tribe called the Obama administration's intervention ""stunning,"" saying it set the stage for nationwide reform on projects affecting tribal lands.
“Our hearts are full, this an historic day for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and for tribes across the nation,” tribal chairman Dave Archambault II said in a statement. ""Our voices have been heard.""
In North Dakota's state capital of Bismarck, hundreds of protesters celebrated the government decision.
“We won! We won!” Bobbi Jean Three Legs, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux of South Dakota, shouted to the cheering crowd.
Dakota Access, subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners LP that is building the pipeline, declined to comment. But an investor in the pipeline project who asked not to be identified said officials were trying to figure out what to do next.
IMPACT ON JOBS
A coalition of oil, business and labor entities from the states the pipeline would cross said the halt could threaten the jobs of thousands of workers.
""Should the Administration ultimately stop this construction, it would set a horrific precedent,"" the Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now said in a statement. ""We hope and trust that the government will base its final decision on sound science and engineering.""
Thousands of people have swelled campgrounds near the site of the proposed pipeline, drawing high-profile protesters like Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein and actress Shailene Woodley.
Last weekend, the protests turned violent as demonstrators breached a wire fence and were confronted by security officers and guard dogs.
After Boasberg said in his ruling that a decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to fast-track the pipeline project was not illegal, tribal leaders quickly filed a notice of appeal.
At the same time, however, government officials were promising to temporarily halt construction of the pipeline on federally owned land.
In their joint statement, the three departments said they would invite Native American leaders to meetings this fall to discuss how the federal government can better consider the tribes' views and respect their land.
The departments also said they respected protesters' rights to assemble and speak freely, and urged all sides to adhere to principles of nonviolence.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns some of the land where the pipeline was slated to be built and has been involved in the permitting process, said it would halt construction on its property until after officials had re-examined Native American concerns about the pipeline as well as previous projects.
The government said it would not authorize construction on land at Lake Oahe, a focal point of protests. 
It called on Dakota Access to halt work on other land, as well. As of late Friday, the company had not said whether it would comply.
When fully connected to existing lines, the 1,100-mile (1,770 km) Dakota Access pipeline would be the first to carry crude oil from the Bakken shale, a vast oil formation in North Dakota, Montana and parts of Canada, directly to the U.S. Gulf. 
It would carry oil from just north of land owned by the tribe to Illinois, where it would connect with an existing pipeline.

In his ruling Boasberg said he could not concur with claims by the Standing Rock Sioux that the government erred in approving the Dakota Access pipeline.

(Reuters) - If investing in commodities involves taking a bet against human ingenuity, than buying natural resource equities is hedging that bet by going long productivity gains at the same time.
That’s because, unlike building exposure to raw commodities, if you buy the shares you get that exposure while also capturing improvements that producing companies make in their reserves, their processes and their overall gains in efficiency.
There is no getting around it: the move by large investors into commodities over the past 10 to 15 years has not been what they hoped. Attracted by a track record of lower volatility and low correlation with equities, investors have been stung as their own presence in commodities markets cranked up both effects. In other words, once big investors got into commodities, those assets started to behave like the rest of the financial markets, a point borne out by research from the Bank for International Settlements. (http://www.bis.org/publ/work420.pdf)
As well, that old bugbear human ingenuity has been working very effectively, driving down the price of energy due to advances like fracking and the discovery of new reserves.
The S&P Natural Resources index, although up 15 percent over one year, has recorded annualized losses of 5.85 percent over five and 1.34 percent over 10 years.
It says something about the beaten down and despised nature of natural resource stock investing that Jeremy Grantham and Lucas White of value investors GMO titled a note advocating them “An Investment Only a Mother Could Love.”
Ugly they may be, but resource stocks are reasonably priced by many metrics and offer diversification and inflation protection (a trait which will look particularly attractive if inflation ever returns and bonds and stocks are hit).
“Here’s an investment that delivers equity-like returns with low to negative correlations with the broad equity market over long periods of time,” Grantham and White write.
“Hedge fund investors generally accept lower-than-equity returns in order to gain access to uncorrelated returns, so getting equity returns with low to negative correlations should be very exciting. In fact, it’s not obvious that you need to know anything else in order to get excited about investing in commodity producers.” (https://www.gmo.com/docs/default-source/research-and-commentary/strategies/equities/global-equities/an-investment-only-a-mother-could-love-the-case-for-natural-resource-equities.pdf)
GMO notes that not only have energy and metals stocks outperformed the rest of the U.S. stock markets over the past 46 years, but a combined portfolio of half resources/half the rest outperforms with markedly lower volatility.
THE DEVIL OF DEFLATION
Commodity stocks have dramatically outperformed their products over the long term. While oil has risen just 0.5 percent annually in real terms since 1925, oil and gas company shares have gone up more than 8 percent a year, adjusted for inflation. In industrial metals the pattern is the same over the same time horizon. Copper is up 0.2 percent annually, in real terms, and aluminum is down 1.7 percent, but industrial metals have returns of 8.6 percent.
That not just because of gains in efficiency but more broadly because the market offers a considerable equity risk premium for those who hold natural resource shares. Investors are shy of natural resource shares, which, as we’ve seen recently, can see huge volatility in the prices of their products, as well as being levered to economic cycles. That’s kept a lid on valuations and driven up the equity risk premium.
Buying into natural resources at a time of very low inflation and, in large parts of the global economy, the threat of deflation, is not an easy thing to do. As well, there are concerns, well reflected in current prices, that future economic growth will be tepid, especially in places like China which have been huge consumers of raw materials the past 20 years.
The flip side of this fear is that natural resources stocks do offer some inflation protection.
Resource equities have not only protected against inflation historically, but have actually significantly increased purchasing power in most inflationary periods. During the last eight episodes of U.S. inflation over 5 percent, natural resource shares have returned more than 6 percent a year while the S&P 500 lagged inflation, thus destroying purchasing power, by 1.6 percent.
Remember too that, for good or ill, this time will be different. We’ve never emerged from an episode of low inflation like this, one which came along with massive central bank asset buying and the resulting inflation of valuations of financial assets.
Not only would bonds be hammered by inflation, as they always are, but the broad stock market may underperform its past results during inflation, as equities feel sharply the removal of central bank support.
A bit of diversification into an ugly, unloved sector may well pay off.

726,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2016 12:02PM ET</span>",Oil falls more than 2 percent but set for weekly gain on deal hopes,"By Catherine Ngai
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 2 percent on Friday, paring the previous session's spike as the market discounted an unexpected slump in U.S. crude inventories as a storm glitch.
Still, the market was on course to gain nearly 5 percent, its first weekly gain in three weeks, on hopes for a global deal on stabilizing crude output after Saudi Arabia, the leading oil producer inside OPEC, and Russia, the biggest producer outside the group, agreed on Monday to cooperate in oversupplied markets.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was down $1.35 at $48.64 a barrel by 11:52 a.m. ET (1552 GMT) after rising above $50 for the first time in two weeks on Thursday. U.S. crude (CLc1) was down $1.16 at $46.46.
Oil prices shot up on Thursday after U.S. government data showed the biggest weekly drop in stockpiles last week since January 1999 as Gulf Coast imports slumped to the lowest on record.  Traders said imports fell as ships delayed offloading cargoes in Texas and Louisiana due to Tropical Storm Hermine.
""We're pulling back after the big run-up yesterday. We're expecting supplies to rise next week as production is back up after the storm in the Gulf of Mexico,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. 
""People are covering their shorts now because the market ran too far too fast."" 
Greenback-denominated oil was also under pressure after the dollar index (DXY) rose on concerns over the health of the EU economy and on remarks by Federal Reserve policymakers helped boost investor expectations of a near-term increase in U.S. interest rates. [USD/]
While the market traded fairly thin on Friday, analysts and traders continued to debate how effective a deal would be to limit supply when OPEC and non-OPEC producers meet informally in Algeria on Sept.26-28.
Algeria's oil minister on Friday underscored that tension, saying that two separate agreements could be required between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, highlighting the difficulties of clinching such deals. 
The oil options market indicates investors could well be holding out for a deal further down the line and are displaying a lot more optimism, as demand and supply come closer to falling into balance. 
The International Energy Agency has said it expects oil demand to finally exceed supply in the third quarter of 2016, meaning record global crude stockpiles should start falling.
But analysts from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note there were risks the market might not rebalance until later.
""Once again, we see an increasing probability for several unexpected bearish developments to come together, which could push off rebalancing (seasonally-adjusted demand exceeding supply) to late 2017, or even 2018,"" Morgan Stanley said.

The market was also watching for Baker Hughes rig count data set to be released around 1 p.m. EST. [RIG/U]

PARIS (Reuters) - French oil and gas company  Total  (PA:TOTF) will increase its exposure to U.S. shale gas by buying 75 percent of Barnett Shale assets from Chesapeake (N:CHK), taking advantage of a far lower price than it paid for its original 25 percent holding.
Total joins other European oil majors including Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa),  BP  (L:BP) and  Statoil  (OL:STL) which have increased their presence in U.S. shale oil and gas production in recent years, hoping to mimic smaller, independent companies.
Shale's low costs compared to complex offshore fields and its rapid production cycles has attracted the oil majors, which have all had to slash spending budgets and shelve many large projects during the current downturn.
Total bought a 25 percent stake in Barnett Shale gas fields in north Texas in 2009 for $800 million in cash, plus $1.45 billion toward the fields' development over six years.
Although the French group has cut spending on U.S. shale production following the fall in oil prices over the past two years, it said the Barnett Shale deal was opportunity-driven and made possible by its preemption rights.
Located in north Texas with a net production of approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, Barnett shale includes 215,000 developed and undeveloped acres of land, wells, leases, minerals, buildings and other properties.
""With the new conditions created by the exit of Chesapeake and the associated restructuring of the midstream contracts, we believe that we can extract significant value from the substantial, well-located resource base,"" Jose Ignacio Sanz, head of Total E&P in United States, said in a statement.
Under the terms of the deal, Chesapeake will pay $334 million to Williams, a company that gathers and processes 80 percent of the gas from the Barnett assets, to terminate its gathering agreement, it said.
""Total E&P USA will supplement Chesapeake’s payment with $420 million to Williams for a fully restructured, competitive gas gathering agreement,"" the statement said, adding that Total will also pay $138 million to be released from three other midstream capacity reservation contracts.

728,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2016 10:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Iranian oil output stagnates for third month amid OPEC bargaining,"By Alex Lawler and Rania El Gamal
LONDON (Reuters) - Iran's steep oil output growth has stalled in the past three months, new data showed, suggesting Tehran might be struggling to fulfill its plans to raise production to new highs while demanding to be excluded from any OPEC deals on supply curbs.
Iran's oil output soared to 3.64 million barrels per day in June from an average of 2.84 million bpd in 2015 following the easing of Western sanctions on Tehran in January, adding to a global crude glut which has slashed oil prices.
But since June, output has stagnated and reached just 3.63 million bpd in August, according to fresh OPEC data based on secondary sources, which include consultants and industry media, and seen by Reuters. Iran also told OPEC it produced 3.63 million bpd in August, according to an OPEC source.
Iran became the main stumbling block to an initiative by OPEC and non-OPEC Russia earlier this year to freeze output globally. Tehran said it needed to first regain market share lost while it was under sanctions.
OPEC's largest producer Saudi Arabia insisted all nations should join and the freeze deal collapsed in April.
As Russia and Saudi Arabia are trying to revive the effort to prop up prices again, Iran has signaled it was more willing to cooperate when OPEC and non-OPEC producers meet in Algiers on Sept. 26-28. But it stopped short of saying it would join the freeze.
""This (production levels) is a million-dollar question,"" said a source familiar with Iranian thinking. ""The shuttle diplomacy is going on to clear which level is considered an aim for Iran.""
BIG BARGAIN
Iran has repeatedly said it needs to reach a level of output of at least 4 million bpd before it agrees to any deal, but one OPEC source said on Thursday the latest request from Iran was to set a target as high as 4.2-4.3 million bpd.
The difference between requested levels and current production would amount to over 0.5 million bpd or half a percent of global oil consumption. 
And even if Iran were unable to produce it immediately, it would give Tehran an upper hand in dialogue with OPEC in the future - if and when Iran manages to bring onboard global oil companies to help it develop its massive oil fields.
Meanwhile, Gulf producers led by Saudi Arabia are insisting that for any deal OPEC members should stick to OPEC's secondary sources data to put everyone on a level playing field, the source added.
""If we could not do that and accept one system - which is to use secondary sources - it would complicate things further,"" the source said.
However, it might be a tough task as those figures show Iran has already returned to pre-sanctions output levels, pumping today as much as it was pumping back in late 2011.
That chimes with estimates from the International Energy Agency which believes Iran's production capacity is very close to what it is already producing.

For some in OPEC, the issue is settled. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday Iran's production has already reached pre-sanctions levels.

Global benchmark Brent fell 122 cents, or 2.44%, to $48.78 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Oil remained on track for a weekly gain after settling more than 4% higher on Thursday after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that crude stocks dropped 14.5 million barrels last week to 511.4 million barrels.
It was the largest weekly decline since January 1999.
Total commercial stockpiles of crude oil and refined products fell by 13.7 million barrels.
Earlier in the week, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories fell 12.1 million barrels in the week ended September 2.
But some analysts said the unexpectedly large drawdown in inventories came as a tropical storm on the East Coast kept cargoes of oil and fuel from being delivered.
Oil prices have fluctuated in recent weeks amid uncertainty over whether the world’s major oil producers will take steps to curb output when they meet later this month.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for December delivery were down 0.16% at $1,339.35, not far from Wednesday’s three-week high of $1,350.50.
The December contract ended Thursday’s session 0.56% lower at $1,341.60 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,323.20, the low from September 6 and resistance at $1,350.50, Wednesday’s high.
Gold prices weakened briefly after data on Thursday showing that U.S. initial jobless claims in the week ending September 3 decreased by 4,000 to a six-week low of 259,000 from the previous week’s total of 263,000. Analysts expected jobless claims to rise by 2,000 to 265,000 last week.
But sentiment on the greenback remained vulnerable after downbeat U.S. employment data published last Friday crushed expectations for an upcoming rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
Markets were also digesting the European Central Bank’s most recent policy statement, as the ECB raised its 2016 growth forecast to 1.7% from 1.6%, but slightly lowered its 2017 forecast from 1.7% to 1.6% on Thursday.
At the conclusion of the bank’s policy meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi said current monetary policy is effective and the changes to the banks growth forecast are not so substantial as to warrant a decision to act.
The comments came after the central bank left its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.0%, in line with market expectations.
Draghi added that interest rates would remain at present or lower levels for an “extended time” so the recovery would not be derailed.

For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported an increase of 3.382 million barrels.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia and other big Middle East crude exporters, will meet non-OPEC producers led by Russia at informal talks in Algeria between September 26 and 28.
Chances that the upcoming meeting would yield any action to reduce the global glut appeared minimal, according to market experts. Instead, most believe that oil producers will continue to monitor the market and possibly postpone freeze talks to the official OPEC meeting in Vienna on November 30.
An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative, underscoring the difficulty for political rivals to forge consensus."
732,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2016 11:04PM ET</span>","Mexico 2017 budget cuts to squeeze Pemex, primary surplus eyed","By Jean Luis Arce and Alexandra Alper
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's government on Thursday set out plans for a bigger-than-anticipated cut in public spending in 2017, with struggling state oil company Pemex earmarked for a 100 billion peso ($5.36 billion) reduction in funding.
New Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said the budget foresaw planned spending cuts of 239.7 billion pesos ($12.83 billion), targeting a primary surplus of 0.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017. It would be the first such surplus since 2008.
Of the cuts, 100 billion pesos fall on Pemex (PMX.UL), which is already facing a funding squeeze and has racked up multi-billion dollar losses for years. Since the government ended its oil and gas monopoly nearly three years ago, Pemex has faced stiff competition from the private sector.
""Pemex is making the biggest contribution to the cuts,"" Meade said, presenting the budget proposal to Congress a day after he was sworn in as finance minister following the resignation of Luis Videgaray.
In late 2013, the government threw open the industry to private capital to reverse a protracted slide in oil production, but falling crude prices have undermined those efforts.
Currently running at some 2.16 million barrels per day (bpd), Mexican oil production will slip to an average of 1.928 million bpd in 2017, the budget forecasts. The last time Mexican crude output fell below 2 million bpd was in 1980.
Still, the budget does foresee changes aimed at easing Pemex's heavy tax load.
Less than two years remain before the next presidential election, and President Enrique Pena Nieto's government is struggling to ramp up economic growth, having fallen well short of its original ambition to achieve annual rates of 5-6 percent.
Hurt by uneven U.S. demand for its goods, Mexico's economy shrank in the second quarter for the first time in three years.
Next year, the budget foresees growth of between 2 and 3 percent, compared with 2.0-2.6 percent in 2016.
Despite the 2017 cuts - well above the 175.1 billion the government eyed in April - non-discretionary spending was expected to rise by 144.3 billion pesos, inflated by higher financing costs and a slide in the peso's value.
Next year the government foresees an overall deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP, 0.6 percentage points less than the 2016 target.
The budget foresaw the peso averaging 18.2 per dollar in 2017, and an average price of $42 per barrel for Mexican crude, in line with the government's hedging program.

Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange edged down 0.05% to $1,340.95 a troy ounce.
Overnight, gold prices struggled for direction in North American trade on Thursday, as investors digested the latest U.S. data as well as comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi.
The number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week fell to a seven-week low, remaining in territory associated with a healthy labor market, official data showed on Thursday.
The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits decreased by 4,000 to 259,000 last week. Analysts expected jobless claims to rise by 2,000 to 265,000 from the previous week’s total of 263,000.
The data did little to alter market expectations for the next U.S. rate hike. According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, investors are pricing in an 18% chance of a rate hike at the Fed's September 20-21 meeting. For December, odds stood at around 52%.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
Meanwhile, the ECB said it was maintaining its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.0%, in line with market expectations. The central bank also held its deposit facility rate unchanged at -0.4% and left its marginal lending at 0.25%.
The central bank expects rates to remain at present level or lower for an ""extended period"".
Additionally, the ECB kept the size of its monthly quantitative easing program at approximately €80 billion. The central bank reiterated that it is prepared to expand its monthly asset-purchase program beyond March 2017, if needed.

Natural gas for delivery in October on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 9.7 cents, or 3.62%, to trade at $2.773 per million British thermal units by 10:32AM ET (14:32GMT). Futures were at around $2.751 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 36 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 2, below expectations for an increase of 43 billion.
That compared with a gain of 51 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 72 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 64 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.437 trillion cubic feet, 5.7% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 8.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
On Wednesday, gas futures sank to a more than two-week low of $2.665 as traders reacted to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Unless intense late-summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles could possibly test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

738,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2016 10:20AM ET</span>","Saudi, Algeria oil ministers to meet OPEC head in push for output deal","By Lamine Chikhi
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria's energy minister will meet his Saudi counterpart and OPEC's secretary-general in Paris on Friday as part of moves towards clinching a global deal on stabilizing crude output to support oil prices, an Algerian official and OPEC sources said.
Algeria will host the informal meeting with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and OPEC's Mohammed Barkindo, said the Algerian official, who asked not to be identified.
A source at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries confirmed the meeting as part of a push for an output deal, with producers battered by a glut-induced halving of oil prices over the past two years.
""There is a strong move towards a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC to at least freeze production,"" the source told Reuters.
""It seems we are going in this direction. But if we are going to freeze, we have to use secondary sources to gauge production levels. We can't allow each country to use a different method,"" the source said.
""Iran must agree to be in line with other producers and use secondary sources.""
Tehran says it supports any measures to stabilize the market. However, it has stopped short of indicating whether it would join a global deal before its production reaches 4 million barrels per day, the level at which it says it was pumping before the imposition of Western sanctions in 2012. 
The sanctions ended in January this year.
Iran has been the main factor preventing an output deal between OPEC and non-OPEC Russia as Tehran has said it should be excluded from any such agreement before its production recovers.
The OPEC source said Iran's production before sanctions had never exceeded 3.75 million bpd according to secondary sources, which include consultants and industry media that estimate output independently.
Iran has said it is producing slightly more than 3.8 million bpd. It signaled on Tuesday it was prepared to work with Saudi Arabia and Russia to prop up prices, although Tehran has begun to bargain with OPEC on possible exemptions from any output cap.
The OPEC source said major oil producers were trying to convince Tehran to come onboard, adding there was an initial understanding that only Libya could be offered an exemption.
""Now there is a push to smooth things out and solve any problem,"" the OPEC source said, adding there had been no agreement yet on any level at which to freeze production.
""This will be discussed in Algeria,"" the source said.
Algeria is hosting meetings of the International Energy Forum and OPEC on Sept. 26-28. Energy Minister Noureddine Bouterfa traveled to Moscow on Thursday, following recent trips to Qatar and Iran. 

OPEC and Russia are expected to revive talks for a global deal on production in Algeria. A similar initiative failed in April after Saudi Arabia insisted Iran join the pact.

739,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2016 10:11AM ET</span>",North Dakota pipeline fight gives spark to Native American activism,"By Andrew Cullen and Ruthy Munoz
CANNON BALL, N.D./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Native American tribe's efforts to halt construction of a crude oil pipeline in North Dakota have swelled into a movement, drawing international attention and the support of movie stars and social media, and making a major oil company blink.
While the tribe's lawyers work to persuade a federal judge to withdraw permits for the pipeline in a ruling expected on Friday, thousands of protesters gathered at campgrounds near Standing Rock Sioux Tribe lands.
""This is a new beginning, not just for our tribe, but for all tribes in this country,"" said Standing Rock Sioux spokesman Ron His Horse is Thunder, one of the leaders hoping for a rebirth of Native American activism beyond the pipeline battle.
Representatives of 200 tribes and environmentalists have set up camp in the rolling hills near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannon Ball rivers in sight of the proposed pipeline route.
They say the planned pipeline, near but not on tribal land, runs through a sacred burial ground and could leak, polluting nearby rivers and poisoning the tribe's water source.
The 1,100 mile (1,770 km), $3.7 billion Dakota Access pipeline would carry oil from just north of the tribe's land in North Dakota to Illinois, where it would hook up to an existing pipeline and route crude directly to refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Protesters have included actress Shailene Woodley and Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who authorities say is part of a group under investigation for illegally spray-painting construction equipment at the site.
""Our indigenous people have been warning for 500 years that the destruction of Mother Earth is going to come back and it's going to harm us,"" said David Archambault, tribal chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux. ""Now our voices are getting louder."" 
On Tuesday, U.S. Judge James Boasberg granted in part the tribe's request for a temporary restraining order to stop the project, and said he would decide by Friday whether to grant the larger challenge to the pipeline, which would require the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw permits.
Protesters were disappointed that the judge did not shut down construction altogether, but savored a small win when the group of companies building the pipeline, led by Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners through its Dakota Access subsidiary, agreed to stop some work until the final ruling.
The pipeline was fast-tracked by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers earlier this year, but the project has been dogged by protests since April.
It was envisioned as a safer way to transport highly flammable oil extracted from the Bakken Shale formation in North Dakota, Montana and parts of Canada than on trains.
In June, a  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) train carrying crude oil derailed and burst into flames in Oregon, forcing the evacuation of a school and the closure of a highway. In 2013, a runaway train in Canada crashed, killing 47 people and destroying buildings in the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic.
DIGGING IN FOR THE LONG HAUL
    The Standing Rock Sioux Reservation is one of six reservations in the Dakotas that are all that remain of what was once the Great Sioux Reservation, which comprised all of South Dakota west of the Missouri River, including the Black Hills, which are considered sacred, according to the tribe's website.
The tribe has 15,000 members in the United States including as many as 8,000 in North and South Dakota. The reservation covers about 9,300 square miles (24,087 square km).
At campsites dotted with white tepees and colorful tents, many people prepared for the long haul.
""People are ready to stay through winter,"" said Allyson Two Bears, who sits on the tribe's emergency response team. 
Members of an Ojibwe tribe are helping to erect lodges capable of withstanding North Dakota cold, and people from as far away as London and South Korea have joined the protest, signing their names to a map at the campsite. 
The tribe has also enlisted the help of online petition website Change.org, which helped it gather more than 250,000 signatures on a petition to stop the pipeline. Youth members of the tribe aged 6 to 25 ran a relay race from North Dakota to Washington, D.C., to deliver the petitions.
The protest and lawsuit by the Standing Rock Sioux are not the first efforts by Native American and environmental groups to stop or reroute planned pipelines through culturally or environmentally sensitive areas. 
Aboriginal Canadian and Native American groups have opposed the Keystone XL Pipeline from Canada to Nebraska, along with other pipeline projects. 
Republican presidential contender Donald Trump has said he would approve TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL pipeline proposal if elected, reversing a decision by the administration of President Barack Obama to block it over environmental concerns. TransCanada has sued the U.S government to reverse Obama's rejection of the pipeline.
The Standing Rock Sioux have hired a political campaign director to publicize their actions to stop the North Dakota pipeline.
""They’ve been making really good use of social media as part of this and that has actually changed the way Native American activism takes place,"" said Katherine Hayes, chair of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis/St. Paul.
The Standing Rock Sioux sued in July. Last month, celebrity activists joined about 100 members of the tribe outside a Washington, D.C., courthouse where hearings were being held, while others demonstrated in North Dakota.
Over the weekend of Sept. 3, protesters broke through a wire fence in an attempt to chase bulldozers grading the land, confronting pipeline security staff and guard dogs in clashes that at times became violent.
Actress Susan Sarandon, who joined the Washington protest, said she was there to help publicize the tribe's cause. 

""These kinds of things happen when people don't have a voice,"" Sarandon said, referring to the government's decision to fast-track the project. ""We have to give them a voice.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 1.5 percent on Thursday after U.S. industry data showed a large drawdown in crude stocks, reflecting the impact of an Atlantic storm.
U.S. crude stocks fell by 12.1 million barrels last week, data from the American Petroleum Institute showed after the market settled on Wednesday, compared with expectations for an increase of about 200,000 barrels. [API/S]
Benchmark Brent crude oil was up 65 cents a barrel at $48.63 by 1220 GMT, after settling up 72 cents on Wednesday. 
U.S. light crude was up 75 cents at $46.25, having ended the previous session up 67 cents.
Stocks of U.S. crude have been at record highs in the past two years, thanks partly to an output-boosting shale oil boom.
But Tropical Storm Hermine, which threatened the Gulf Coast refining region last week before moving to the East Coast of the United States, led to the loss of some U.S. oil production and limited imports.
The U.S. government said on Aug. 29 that 11.5 percent of Gulf of Mexico output was shut in as a precautionary measure.
""The big crude draw was a temporary move,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates. ""The big picture is bearish. The API stats are only a road bump on the way down.""
Oil was also buoyed by robust trade data from China, which showed its crude imports in August surged by nearly a quarter from a year ago to the second-highest amount ever, driven by independent refiners rushing to cash in on low oil prices before import quotas expire in December.
Oil hit a one-week high on Monday after Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to cooperate on stabilising the oil market. Prices have since fallen because of uncertainty over the chances of an output freeze being agreed by producer nations, particularly after an April meeting in Doha failed to reach an agreement.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers such as Russia are expected to discuss the issue at informal talks in Algeria from Sept. 26-28.
Many analysts expect oil prices to decline ahead of the OPEC meeting because they see world markets as well supplied.

""We are at the top end of the recent price range at the moment and will move towards the lower end,"" said Carsten Fritsch, senior analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.

742,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2016 07:40AM ET</span>",Brazil urged to expand land rental market but small farmers aren't convinced,"By Chris Arsenault
RIO PRETO, Brazil (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Brazilian farmer Ivan Engler shakes his head at the thought of renting out his land, where he grows sweet potato and passion fruit, despite overtures from a big agricultural company keen to expand its territory.
For years, the farmer raised his family on this 11-hectare plot of land outside Brasilia. The proceeds have fed, clothed and provided his children with an education.
""For the wellbeing of my family, I thought about renting my land,"" Engler told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 
""But I don't want to rent my land to bigger companies or big farms ... I like seeing my small farm grow.""
In many developed countries, big commercial agricultural firms often lease land from small-scale farmers to help consolidate land holdings. 
Supporters of the practice say it can help improve efficiency and profitability in farm operations while safeguarding long-term land rights for farmers like Engler.
However, in Brazil, where one percent of the population owns nearly half the land and territorial conflicts are common due to a lack of property deeds, many small-scale growers are not convinced they should pursue commercial rental deals.
Their concerns could be a stumbling block to efforts to boost production in Brazil, which is already the world's largest exporter of sugar, coffee and beef.
If Brazil's newly-installed government is to achieve its goal of expanding the country's vast agricultural potential, the slow rental market needs to be addressed, land experts say.
""The best way to get this (growth) would be through a rental market,"" said Maximo Torero, director of markets at the Washington D.C.-based International Food Policy Research Group (IFPRI). 
""The farmers are included; they still have ownership,"" Torero told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 
""They get rent money and the land is used more effectively.""
GROWING FARMS
Under rental agreements, small-scale landowners retain their title deeds, but larger companies with access to capital and machinery pay for the right to use the land to grow their crops.
Owners' fears their land could be taken over in unscrupulous business dealings have contributed to a weak farmland rental market in Brazil, which has cumbersome regulations in comparison with other major economies, researchers say.
Less than four percent of Brazil's farmland is rented under lease or sharecropping contracts compared to 33 percent in Europe or 38 percent in the United States, according to the World Census of Agriculture. 
""A lot of Brazilians view land renting as exploitative,"" said Lee Alston, a professor of economics at Indiana University, who studies land markets. 
Frequent land conflicts in South America's largest country and unclear property titles in rural areas have deterred owners from renting their land, Alston said. 
""They fear it could be expropriated,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
The government needs to simplify rental contracts so investments are protected, he said.
MONOCULTURE QUANDARY
The expansion of land rentals has also run into criticism for favoring the production of monoculture crops like soy or sugar by large farms, rather than more varied food for local consumption.
""Land rentals usually mean that a rich farmer will exploit the land of a poor farmer,"" said Daniel Balaban, director of the United Nations Centre of Excellence Against Hunger in Brasilia.
""It's not in the best interest of Brazilian public policies to encourage the expansion of this market,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 
Seventy percent of the food consumed by Brazilians is grown by small farmers, according to U.N. data. 
If they rent out their land, larger farms are more likely to grow less healthy food for export, Balaban said. 
""For small farmers the land is not only their work,"" Balaban said. ""It's their home.""
Back on his farm, Engler, the fruit and vegetable grower, agrees. Today, he isn't keen on renting his land to a larger operation, but he says his views might change as he gets older. 
Engler's two daughters have moved away from the farm to take jobs in the city. They show little interest in moving back to the countryside to work on the land, he said. 

""I am not sure yet what I will do in the future,"" Engler said, adding that his daughters might want to rent out the land once he retires.

The production plans, for the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan's sector and Lukoil's Filanovsky field in the Russian sector, are the clearest sign yet that significant volumes from the projects will be going imminently on to a world market that already has a glut of supply, possibly pushing down prices.
By the end of next year, according to targets previously announced by the fields' operators, Kashagan and Filanovsky will between them produce about 500,000 bpd, equivalent to about 0.5 percent of global production.
Production at the long-delayed Kashagan offshore project will start in October this year, according to industry sources who have seen Kazakh Energy Ministry documents on the field. 
Output will initially be 75,000 bpd in October, rising to between 150,000 and 180,000 in the November-December period of this year, the sources told Reuters, citing the ministry documents.

The world's second largest buyer of the precious metal behind India, China reported a trade balance surplus of $52.05 billion, narrower than the $58.00 billion seen for August with exports down 2.8%, less than the 4.0% decline seen year-on-year, and imports up 1.5%, beating an expected 4.9% drop and making the first gain in 22 months as global commodity prices show signs of a rebound.
Overnight, gold prices were little changed near a three-week high in North American trade on Wednesday, as investors focused on the next set of U.S. data and Fed speakers for further guidance on the timing of the next interest rate hike.
Job openings reached 5.871 million in July, a bit higher than the 5.58 million expected.
The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index fell from 55.5 in July to 51.4 in August, its weakest level since February 2010.
That followed last week's lackluster U.S. employment report as well as the ISM's manufacturing survey, which showed a shocking contraction in activity.
The recent string of disappointing data all but quashed talk of a near-term rate hike from the Fed. According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, investors are pricing in a 15% chance of a rate hike at the Fed's September 20-21 meeting.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.

750,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2016 04:40PM ET</span>",Volatile gold demand tarnishes U.S. commodity fund sales,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Turning fortunes for gold pushed withdrawals from U.S.-based commodity funds to their highest levels since April, Investment Company Institute data for the latest week showed on Wednesday.
Investors pulled $601 million from those mutual funds and exchange-traded funds during the week through Aug. 31, the trade group said, though many gold funds have seen a rebound in recent days.
The fickle buying and selling of funds, such as SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), comes after some U.S. monetary policymakers suggested they favored raising interest rates sooner rather than later, though weak economic data have damped their case.
Hiking rates would raise the opportunity cost of holding assets such as gold, which despite its strong price gains this year yields little.
Precious metals commodities funds tracked by Thomson Reuters Lipper, a research service, have recorded negative performance for the four weeks through the end of August.
But the flows have started to rebound alongside of a rise in the price of gold recently. GLD took in $607 million on Tuesday, according to FactSet Research Systems Inc, which tracks the ETF market.
John LaForge, head of real asset strategy at the  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's Investment Institute, said he does not see concerns over central bank policy or economic problems helping support gold prices further.
""If you look at gold versus the other major assets, it's overpriced relative to its history,"" said LaForge. 
It was a fairly quiet end to August for other asset classes.
Stock funds posted $910 million in outflows, ICI data showed, a more moderate figure than the $3.3 billion in outflows averaged over the prior five weeks.

Bond funds, which unlike stock funds have been popular for the better part of the year, took in $2.5 billion, according to the ICI. That is a slower pace of inflows for the funds, compared to the $7.5 billion prior five-week average.

Natural gas for delivery in October on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell to an intraday low of $2.687 per million British thermal units, the weakest level since August 23.
It was last at $2.696 by 10:32AM ET (14:32GMT), down 2.1 cents, or 0.77%.
Market players looked ahead to weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build of approximately 40 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 2.
That compares with a gain of 51 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 72 billion a year earlier and a five-year average build of 64 billion cubic feet.
Total gas in storage currently stands at 3.401 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 7.0% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 9.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
On Tuesday, gas futures sank 7.5 cents, or 2.69%, as traders reacted to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Unless intense late-summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles could possibly test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose on Wednesday to pare some of the previous day's losses, partly thanks to a weaker U.S. dollar, but the limited likelihood of a near-term agreement among the world's biggest exporters to rein in production kept gains in check.
November Brent crude futures rose 50 cents to $47.76 a barrel by 1105 GMT, while U.S. crude futures gained 40 cents to trade at $45.23 a barrel.
Oil hit a one-week high on Monday after Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to cooperate on stabilizing the oil market. Prices have since fallen due to uncertainty over a deal, particularly after a meeting in Doha in April among the world's largest producers to discuss output ended in failure. 
""The market is reacting to all those headlines but I think if there is a 'Doha Two', it's probably going to be at the end of March or April 2017 and until then, there will continue to be discussions and negotiations, which will make a lot of headlines,"" Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers such as Russia are expected to discuss an output freeze at informal talks in Algeria on Sept. 26-28. 
""Even if there were no output deal at the informal talks, oil may not fall and could stay around $45 (a barrel) as shale oil production is not growing,"" said Tetsu Emori, president of Emori Capital Management in Tokyo.
Iran has said it would cooperate on a freeze only if fellow exporters recognized its right to boost market share to levels reached before the imposition of nuclear-related sanctions, which have now been lifted.
Analysts at Citi warned Iranian involvement would be a key hurdle for an OPEC decision and added it was unlikely that any viable agreement would impact physical market balances.
In the short term, dollar weakness following soft U.S. economic data could support oil as non-U.S. investors take advantage of a relatively cheaper currency to buy dollar-denominated assets. 
Traders said U.S. crude was supported by Genscape data showing a draw of some 700,000 barrels last week at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub for U.S. crude futures.
U.S. commercial crude inventories likely dropped by 100,000 barrels last week after rising for two straight weeks, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.

LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Iran signalled on Tuesday it was prepared to work with Saudi Arabia and Russia to prop up oil prices as Tehran began to bargain with OPEC on possible exemptions from output limits.
Iran has been the main factor preventing an output deal between OPEC and non-OPEC Russia as Tehran argued it should be excluded from any such agreement before its production recovers from Western sanctions that ended in January.
Iran's rival Saudi Arabia has said it would agree to a deal only if Tehran took part. However, with Iranian production rising close to pre-sanctions levels, Riyadh has signaled in recent weeks it is ready to compromise.
Russia has also said it was ready to accept certain exemptions, especially as Iran was close to reaching output levels of 4 million barrels per day (bpd) after which it could no longer boost production further.
On Monday, Russia and Saudi Arabia signed a pact agreeing to work together to help balance the oil market but giving little detail on possible action to help eradicate a global glut. 
On Tuesday, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh met OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo in Tehran and said he would support any measure to stabilize crude prices at around $50-60 per barrel.
""Iran wants a stable market and therefore any measure that helps the stabilization of the oil market is supported by Iran,"" Zanganeh said. 
OPEC members will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum (IEF), which groups producers and consumers, in Algeria on Sept. 26-28, during which they are expected to discuss a possible output freeze. 
Russia is also expected to attend the IEF.
Hit by global oversupply, oil prices (LCOc1) collapsed to as low as $27 per barrel earlier this year from as high as $115 in mid-2014, but have since recovered to around $47.
""We support oil prices between $50 and $60 per barrel,"" Zanganeh said.
SHUTTLE DIPLOMACY
Most OPEC producers and Russia are pumping at capacity. Only Iran and potentially Iraq could raise output in the medium term.
The key question for a potential freeze, therefore, would be at which levels production is frozen.
If production is stabilized at early-2015 levels, it would effectively mean a cut as most producers - including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq and Iran - have ramped up output since then.
Seyed Mohsen Ghamsari, director of international affairs at National Iranian Oil Co, said on Monday Iran was ready to raise production to 4 million bpd in the next two to three months depending on market demand. [nL3N1BH1NQ]
A source familiar with Iranian thinking said on Tuesday the Saudi-Russian pact was making a global output agreement more likely.
""Surely Iran at some point reached production capacity of slightly more than 4 million bpd, but actual production just before the imposition of sanctions was below 4 million,"" the source said.
""The shuttle diplomacy is going on to clear which level is considered an aim for Iran,"" he added.

A source familiar with Gulf thinking said if no compromise with Iran were found before the meeting in Algeria, there would be time to secure one ahead of OPEC's regular gathering in November in Vienna.

762,By Business Insider,"<span>Sep 06, 2016 11:06AM ET</span>",The Russia-Saudi oil cooperation is actually a sign of 'extreme economic duress',"Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to cooperate on oil and to create a ""working group"" to stabilize markets on Monday at the G-20 summit in China, just weeks ahead of the informal oil talks to be held in Algiers on September 26-27.
However, the two oil powerhouses didn't announce any concrete action plan, which had some analysts wondering whether this latest development would actually lead to anything — especially given that Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia's oil minister,  dismissed the need for a production freeze.
Moreover, the team at Capital Economics pointed out that most OPEC members and Russia are already pumping oil at record levels, which suggests that they have little spare capacity. ""The upshot is that there was nothing in Monday's announcement to change our view that oil prices will finish the year a little lower than they are now,"" wrote Tom Pugh, the firm's commodities economist, in a note to clients.
And big oil players remain at odds in various geopolitical situations, including in Syria and Yemen, which adds another dimension to all potential decisions.
Prices for Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, surged by as much as 6% to $49.90 per barrel in the immediate aftermath before giving back most of their gains later in the day.
However, other analysts have argued that there's more to the latest overture than meets the eye.
Monday's announcement, ""while short on details and immaterial for actual supply and demand balances, is another indicator of the extreme economic duress that producers are enduring, and in our view, increases the likelihood of some type of collective action if prices remain under significant pressure,"" Helima Croft, the global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients.
""We take the view that potential joint action discussion is a symbolic attempt to shore up sentiment since there is little else to lose given that most countries are already producing flat out,"" she added.
Although Saudi Arabia and Russia are nowhere near  the chaos engulfing OPEC's so-called ""Fragile Five"" —  Nigeria,  Venezuela,  Libya, Iraq, and Algeria — they, too, have seen their fortunes shrink over the past two years.
Russia's economy shrank by 3.7% in 2015. And, although things have  started to  somewhat stabilize, the IMF forecasts it will contract by 1.2% in 2016. Plus, an estimated 13.4% of the population is currently living in poverty (about 19.2 million people), according to  data from March 2016, and there have been  several  protests regarding economic concerns this year.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, which has managed to weather the lower-for-longer environment far better than most of its OPEC colleagues, is not without  problems.  FX reserves are down almost $190 billion since oil prices started falling;  Bloomberg reports that the country is aiming to cancel over $20 billion of projects and to slash ministry budgets by a quarter; there have been  several ugly economic data points; and the public  hasn't been happy with some austerity measures, such as the sharp rise in electricity bills. 
As such, ""while geopolitical tensions between key producers continue to run high because of ongoing conflicts in Syria and Yemen, their leaders may yet opt for pragmatism and seek some financial relief that will allow them to keep their increasingly restive citizens content and off the streets,"" Croft argued.
It's worth nothing that previous attempts to re-instate production quotas  have not always yielded desired results. However, the fact that even the better-off producers are increasingly feeling the strain of the lower-for-longer environment somewhat raises the stakes. 
Also notably, a coordinated decision could underscore the oil cartel's legitimacy.
 ""Although co-operative action taken by the cartel and other key producers may prove to be more of an optics play than physically actionable, at a minimum, it alters sentiment, puts a floor into the market, and reminds the market of OPEC's capacity to co-operate,"" wrote Croft.
""It would also prove that the prolific pronouncements of the cartel's demise are premature.""

763,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2016 10:04AM ET</span>",Oil slips below $47 as hopes for producer action wane,"By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil slipped below $47 a barrel on Tuesday, falling further from the previous session's one-week high on receding hopes for imminent action to tackle a global supply glut.
Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed on Monday to cooperate in world oil markets, prompting Brent to jump almost 5 percent only for it to pare gains after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said there was no need to freeze output for now.
Brent crude for November was down $1.20 at $46.43 a barrel by 1352 GMT. U.S. crude for October, which did not settle on Monday due to the Labor Day holiday, was at $44.02, down 42 cents from Friday's close.
While the Saudi minister played down the prospect of imminent action, his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak said he was open to ideas on what cut-off period to use if countries chose to freeze output and said even production cuts could be considered.
""Differences still remain and will reinforce already heightened levels of scepticism that supply will soon be restrained,"" said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM.
Oil prices are half their level of mid-2014, hurting producing nations' income. OPEC and Russia tried earlier this year to curb the glut by seeking an output freeze, but the deal collapsed in April due to tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers such as Russia will hold informal talks in Algeria on Sept. 26-28. Others in the market are sceptical a deal will happen.
""The two nations' cooperation is understandable,"" said Kaname Gokon, a strategist with Okato Shoji Co Ltd.
""But when oil output is reduced, other producers would receive the benefit. There is still a question whether they can cut production for a sustainable period.""
Iran, which is raising exports after the lifting of Western sanctions in January, refused to participate in the earlier effort to freeze output. Saudi Arabia insisted all producers take part, prompting the collapse of the talks.
By some measures, Iran is pumping at its pre-sanctions rate. OPEC and industry sources have said Tehran now appears to be more willing to reach an understanding with other producers.

OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo met Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh in Tehran on Tuesday. Zanganeh, after the meeting, voiced support for steps to boost prices, without specifying whether Iran would join such an effort.

But prices pared gains later in the session to end well off the highs as details of the agreement underwhelmed traders who had been hoping for a production freeze.
The world’s two largest oil producers said they will set up a working group to monitor the oil market and come up with recommendations to promote stability.
Saudi Arabian oil minister Khalid al-Falih and his Russian counterpart, Alexander Novak, will meet in Algeria later this month and in Vienna in November to discuss how to cooperate under the new agreement.
Dampening optimism, al-Falih said there was no need to freeze production at the moment. He added, however, that freezing output was one of the preferred possibilities.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia and other big Middle East crude exporters, will meet non-OPEC producers led by Russia at informal talks in Algeria between September 26 and 28 to discuss a freeze output.
Chances that the upcoming meeting in late September would yield any action to reduce the global glut appeared minimal, according to market experts.
Instead, most believe that oil producers will continue to monitor the market and possibly postpone freeze talks to the official OPEC meeting in Vienna on November 30.
An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative, underscoring the difficulty for political rivals to forge consensus.
Meanwhile, crude oil for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was at $44.16 a barrel, down 30 cents, or 0.7%, from its last settlement on Friday.

772,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2016 04:29PM ET</span>",Hermine spares much of East Coast but dampens holiday,"By Laila Kearney
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hermine, a storm that raked Florida with hurricane-force winds last week, drifted far off the U.S. East Coast on Monday, sparing the Middle Atlantic states but forcing some beach closures.
Forecasters warned swimmers and boaters along the Eastern Seaboard to stay out of treacherous waters and rough surf churned up by the storm as it chugged on a northwesterly direction. 
On Cape Cod and its offshore islands, high surf and wind put a crimp in the Labor Day plans of many people looking to celebrate summer's end, but some beaches farther south reopened.
An exception was New York City, which said all public beaches would be closed through Tuesday because of ""life threatening"" rip currents generated by Hermine.
Hermine, classified as a Category 1 hurricane when it slammed into Florida's Gulf Coast early on Friday, became a post-tropical storm by week's end after its winds dropped below 74 mph (119.09 kph) and it lost its tropical characteristics. 
The storm, which crossed northern Florida and then moved up the Georgia and the Carolina coasts, was still packing sustained surface winds of up to 70 mph (110 kph) with higher gusts on Monday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service.
Forecasters expected Hermine to linger off the Northeast before gradually weakening by Tuesday morning.
For now, its strongest winds were extending outward by about 230 miles (370 km), failing to reach U.S. shores.
""Just because it's a post-tropical cyclone doesn't mean the impact of tropical force winds, winds in general and storm surge go away,"" cautioned National Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen.
Hermine was forecast to bring up to 2 inches (5 cm) of rain to Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts through Wednesday.
A tropical storm warning remained in effect on Monday from the eastern end of New York's Long Island and to Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Island off Cape Cod in Massachusetts.
At least one ferry operator on Monday canceled some trips to Nantucket, which reported winds of up to 39 mph (63 km), because of the storm. ""We are taking it trip by trip at this time,"" Hy-Line Cruises said in a Twitter message.
On Block Island off Narragansett, Rhode Island, people appeared to be taking the unsettled weather in stride, even though it kept many tourists away.
""Windy & cloudy on #BlockIsland after windy & brilliant yesterday. No ferries. Island deserted. Almost ideal. (Unless you own a business),"" Twitter user Tom Anderson said.
Storm-surge inundation levels of no more than one to three feet (30 cm to 1 m) were expected in coastal areas.
As the threat to New Jersey waned, Governor Chris Christie ordered Island Beach State Park reopened for Monday, while warning that lingering rip currents and rough surf might still make the ocean unsafe for swimmers.
At 2 p.m. EDT on Monday, Hermine's center was about 200 miles (320 km) southeast of the eastern tip of Long Island. It was expected to move northwest at about 6 mph (9 kph). 
It is forecast to ""meander slowly"" off the New England shore until Tuesday and dissipate through the end of the week, the hurricane center said.
Hermine became the first hurricane to make landfall in Florida in 11 years, packing winds of 80 mph (130 kph), and knocking out power to 300,000 homes and businesses. 

The storm claimed at least two lives, in Florida and North Carolina, but the widespread power outages and flooding that battered Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas had yet to materialize farther north, where alarming news reports scared many tourists away from the beach on Sunday.

Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Natural gas for delivery in October on the New York Mercantile Exchange touched an intraday low of $2.734 per million British thermal units, the weakest level since August 23.
It was last at $2.738 by 10:42AM ET (14:42GMT), down 2.6 cents, or 0.94%.
Trade volumes were expected to remain light on Monday, with many investors in the U.S. away for the Labor Day holiday. Trading in natural gas ends at 1:00PM ET, while U.S. stock markets are closed for trading all day.
Summer heat has waned and cooler temperatures beckon with the approach of autumn, when gas demand typically slackens and prices fall.
Total gas in storage currently stands at 3.401 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 7.0% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 9.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense late-summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles could possibly test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for November delivery jumped more than 5% to touch a daily peak of $49.40 a barrel earlier in the day before giving back some gains to trade at $47.18 by 8:42AM ET (12:42GMT), up just 35 cents, or 0.75%.
Meanwhile, crude oil for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 77 cents, or 1.74%, to trade at $44.92 a barrel after soaring more than 5% to a session high of $46.53.
Oil prices spiked sharply on reports that Saudi Arabia and Russia planned to make a joint statement at the G20 meeting in China on Monday. But futures started to give back some gains amid disappointment over the details of the agreement.
The world’s two largest oil producers said they will set up a working group to monitor the oil market and come up with recommendations to promote stability, according to reports.
Saudi Arabian oil minister Khalid al-Falih and his Russian counterpart, Alexander Novak, will meet in Algeria in October and in Vienna in November to discuss how to cooperate under the new agreement, the reports said.
OPEC members are set to discuss a potential production cap at an informal meeting on the sidelines of an energy conference in Algeria between September 26-28.
On Friday, crude settled 3% higher after Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with Bloomberg that an agreement between major oil exporters to freeze output would be the right decision to support the market.
His comments followed similar rhetoric from Saudi Arabia's foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir, who reportedly said on Thursday that some sort of a production agreement could be made between OPEC and non-OPEC producers at this month's meeting.
Despite the supportive remarks, chances that the upcoming meeting in late September would yield any action to reduce the global glut appeared minimal, according to market experts. Instead, most believe that oil producers will continue to monitor the market and possibly postpone freeze talks to the official OPEC meeting in Vienna on November 30.
An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative, underscoring the difficulty for political rivals to forge consensus.

Russian energy minister Alexander Novak stated the agreement was a “historic moment” in relations between OPEC members and those producers that did not form a part of the organization, according to a report from Interfax. 
Novak added that Russia and Saudi Arabia have agreed on joint actions on oil markets, insisting that there are specific instruments for stabilization, including a production freeze. 
The Russian energy minister also reportedly indicated that both countries will form a working group on cooperation in the field of oil and gas and will meet in Moscow in October.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Crude prices reversed early losses on Monday as the dollar lost its momentum, but persistent concerns over a global glut despite some signs producers may try to tackle weak oil futures kept a lid on gains.
Oil prices fell about 1 percent earlier in the day with the dollar holding firm as disappointing U.S. jobs growth data did little to change investors' perception that the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates in coming months. [USD/]
By 0653 GMT, London Brent crude for November delivery (LCOc1) was up 7 cents at $46.90 a barrel, recovering as the dollar slipped slightly versus a basket of currencies (DXY). Brent settled up $1.38 on Friday. 
U.S. crude for October delivery (CLc1) was unchanged at $44.44 a barrel. Trading is likely to be limited on Monday because of the U.S. Labor Day holiday.
Brent rallied to above $50 a barrel in late August, helped by growing talk of a coordinated production freeze, but prices have since fallen as few believe OPEC will cut output.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak has said that an oil production freeze would be one of the issues discussed by crude producers later this month in Algeria.
""Even though there will be discussions in Algeria, there's no strong feeling that anything will be done, so the supply remains high,"" Tony Nunan, oil risk manager at Japan's Mitsubishi Corp in Tokyo said. 
""Saudi Arabia's position hasn't changed. They are open to some kind of production freeze if Iran and other major producers join,"" Nunan added.
Iran, OPEC's third largest producer, has said it would only cooperate in talks to freeze output if fellow exporters recognized its right to fully regain market share.
""Even if successful, an OPEC freeze would likely be a short-term positive but a medium-term negative for oil prices,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts wrote in a note. ""If a short-term freeze were implemented, oil prices would rise on the news, but it would do little to correct the near-term oversupply.""

Iran is ready to raise its output to 4 million barrels per day in a couple of months depending on market demand, a senior official from the National Iranian Oil Company said.

Kidnapping for ransom is a common problem in some parts of Nigeria and the southern Delta energy hub has seen an increase in crime since the start of attacks by militants calling for more oil wealth to go to the impoverished region.
The abduction took place on a road connecting the towns of Omoku and Elele, around 50 km (30 miles) from the city of Port Harcourt, Rivers state, in the early hours of Friday as the employees of Nigerian energy company Nestoil traveled to work, police said.
""We have recovered the vehicle they were traveling in before the incident occurred. Police are currently combing bushes around the area in a bid to find and release the victims,"" said Nnamdi Omoni of Rivers state police.

""With the FOMC likely to stay in September and the dollar dictating where we could go, it's quite likely oil will hold at mid-$40 levels,"" said Carl Larry Director, director of business development for oil & gas at Frost & Sullivan.
""But more telling of how oil performs will be the rig count in coming weeks and OPEC gestures to support prices.""
Oil rose earlier in the session on comments by Russia favorable to OPEC's hopes of implementing an output freeze with other oil producers.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia and other big Middle East crude exporters, will meet non-OPEC producers led by Russia at informal talks in Algeria between Sept. 26 and 28 to discuss a freeze output.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a Bloomberg interview such a freeze would be right to support prices.
If OPEC fails to strike a deal in Algeria, it is expected to try more action to prop the market its policy meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30.
Many analysts remain skeptical that it will be successful.

""The oil price will remain volatile over the coming weeks,"" said Hans van Cleef, senior oil economist at ABN Amro.

795,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2016 06:20PM ET</span>",Ex-oil traders win partial victory over BP in Canada dispute,"By Jarrett Renshaw
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A team of former Wall Street oil traders have won a partial victory in their continuing legal dispute with oil major  BP  (LON:BP) PLC over how to properly run a remote eastern Canadian refinery, according to court documents filed Thursday.
The legal fight, first reported by Reuters in March, stems from allegations leveled by BP that equity-backed NARL Refining violated its crude and product supply agreement when the refiner failed to maximize yields at the 115,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Come by Chance, Newfoundland. 
Among other things, BP alleged that NARL ran the refinery at high rates when it was not economical, in order to exploit a unique clause in their contract that allowed NARL to earn a higher profit on oil refined in excess of 90,000 barrels. 
The arbitration panel ruled late in August that NARL had no contractual obligation to run the refinery to the mutual benefit of both parties and tossed out that part of BP’s allegations. 
“There are no words of any kind requiring to maximize refinery margins for the benefit of BP,” the ruling says of the refiner, which is operated by SilverPeak Financial Partners, formed by a group of Wall Street veterans.
However, the panel agreed to move forward with BP’s other allegation that NARL failed to provide required information, such as economic models, and to discuss possible crude slates, court documents show. Without that information, BP could not evaluate whether the refinery was running optimally.
Geoff Morrell, a senior vice president of U.S. communications and external affairs at BP, said the arbitration process has a long way to go and the company is confident that it will prevail on the remaining issues. 
NARL declined comment.
Arbitration proceedings are typically private affairs, but the ruling was temporarily posted Thursday on a New York federal court website, before it was taken down at the request of BP. The judge overseeing the case has postponed any decisions on a related case brought by NARL until the arbitration proceedings have concluded. 
At issue is a routine ""tolling"" arrangement for independent refineries that lack the trading operations and credit lines necessary to operate in the global market. BP supplied the crude to the refinery and took back roughly 82 percent of the refined fuels, such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, paying NARL a fixed “toll” of $9.45 per barrel on the first 90,000 barrels of oil put through each day. NARL could earn more than the toll revenue on barrels produced in excess of that figure.
The oil company alleges NARL ran the refinery at more than 90,000 bpd to capitalize on the incentive - a charge the arbitrators rejected.
In a counterclaim, NARL alleges that BP made only lesser grades of crude available, resulting in ""significant and long-term damage"" to refinery equipment, including a vacuum tower that had to be shut down abruptly. 
The refinery owners have formed their own crude supply desk ahead of the expiration, sources have told Reuters. 

The small commercial desk will rely largely on the spot crude market, but will also ink term deals, the two sources said.

796,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2016 01:23PM ET</span>",Florida braces for first hurricane in a decade,"By Letitia Stein
TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Florida prepared for what could be the first hurricane to strike the state in more than a decade as Tropical Storm Hermine picked up strength on Thursday, blasting its way toward the state's northern Gulf Coast.
The storm, with winds gusting 70 mph (110 kph), was expected to reach hurricane force of more than 74 mph (119 kph) by the time it makes landfall, likely in northwest Florida overnight, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.
The last hurricane to strike Florida was Wilma in 2005, the hurricane center said. 
After battering coastal Florida, Hermine is expected to barrel across the northern part of the state into Georgia, then slam southern U.S. coastal regions on the Atlantic. Tropical storm warnings have been issued through parts of North Carolina.
In Florida, forecasters warned of potentially life-threatening storm surge that could swell seas as high as 8 feet (2.4 meters), in some coastal areas. Shelters were open throughout the state. 
With as much as 20 inches (51 cm) of rain expected, many schools from Florida's central Gulf Coast to Tallahassee were closed on Thursday.
Governor Rick Scott has declared a state of emergency in 51 of Florida's 67 counties in advance of the storm's arrival.
Mandatory evacuations were ordered in parts of five counties in northwest Florida, and voluntary evacuations were in place in three more coastal counties, Scott told reporters. 
""This is life threatening. We have not had a hurricane in years,"" Scott said, noting that 8,000 members of the Florida National Guard were prepared to be mobilized.
As of 1 p.m. EDT, the storm was about 135 miles (220 km) southwest of Apalachicola, Florida in the Gulf of Mexico. A tropical storm warning was extended south of Tampa on the state's west coast and to the state's northeastern Atlantic Coast.
On its current path, the storm also could dump as much as 10 inches (25 cm) of rain on coastal areas of Georgia, which was under a tropical storm watch, and the Carolinas.
Georgia Governor Nathan Deal on Thursday signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency for 56 counties that extends through midnight on Saturday. 
Some U.S. oil and gas producers in the eastern parts of the Gulf of Mexico were returning workers to offshore facilities on Thursday and restarting operations shut as the system moves toward Florida.
In the Pacific, a hurricane watch was issued for Hawaii and Maui counties as Hurricane Lester, currently a Category 2 storm, approaches the state. While expected to continue weakening, it could affect Hawaii during the weekend. 
Madeline, which has weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm, was south of Hawaii's Big Island, where officials had opened shelters and shuttered offices and schools on Wednesday. 
Hawaii Governor David Ige signed an emergency proclamation freeing up state resources which runs through Sept. 9.

The hurricane center also said in an advisory that another storm, Hurricane Gaston, will move near the Azores on Friday.

Natural gas for delivery in October on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 0.083 cents, or 2.91%, to trade at $2.803 per million British thermal units by 14:33GMT, or 10:33AM ET.
Futures were at around $2.847 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 51 billion cubic feet in the week ended August 26, while analysts had forecast an increase of 41 billion.
That compared with an advance of 11 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 96 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 67 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.401 trillion cubic feet, 7.5% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 10.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
A day earlier, prices rose 0.06 cents, or 2.12%, as traders waited for the fresh weekly storage data.
Some market analysts said persistent heat late into the season could push power generators to continue burning gas.
Unless intense late-summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles could possibly test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
Meanwhile, forecasts for warmer than normal temperatures across most parts of the continental U.S. in the days ahead provided support.
Updated weather forecasting models pointed to very warm late summer temperatures into mid-September, boosting demand expectations for the cooling fuel.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning."

""On top of that, anticipation of a higher dollar if the Fed starts to hike rates is negative for oil prices. And there's also uncertainty about the likelihood of OPEC/non-OPEC action at the end of the month.""
Brent crude for November was down 40 cents at $46.49 a barrel by 1255 GMT after settling $1.84 lower at Wednesday's close. U.S. crude was 35 cents lower at $44.35 a barrel, after falling $1.65 in the previous session.
Brent rose almost $10 a barrel through early August to a high above $51 two weeks ago on expectations that the world's biggest oil producers would take some action to prop up oil prices weighed down by global oversupply.
Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are due to meet in Algeria on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum (IEF) on Sept. 26-28, and are expected to discuss a deal to freeze global output.
Russia is also expected to attend the IEF.
But many investors doubt OPEC will be able to agree a common position on production and prices have fallen in recent days. Many past efforts to restrict production have failed and OPEC is responsible for only around 40 percent of world output.
""There is still lots of correction potential, given the overhang of speculative long positions and exaggerated hopes for an output freeze,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) oil analyst Carsten Fritsch.
Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Thursday OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers were moving towards a common position on production, suggesting talks in Algeria might be successful.
But many analysts are skeptical.

802,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2016 07:41AM ET</span>","Tired of cheap oil, Saudis eye price boost to drive Aramco IPO","By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Two years after triggering an oil price war, Saudi Arabia has seemingly had enough of cheap crude amid budget pressures, fear of a future supply shortage, and as it seeks to offload a stake in state-owned producer Aramco.
The change in tone comes as OPEC and other producers such as Russia may resume talks on stabilizing output when they meet in Algeria later this month, after a similar effort to boost oil prices collapsed in April due to Saudi-Iranian tensions.
""The Saudis are going to Algeria for a freeze,"" said a source in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries who is familiar with the matter and declined to be identified.
""More and more ministers are now talking among themselves to evaluate their production position.""
OPEC in November 2014 made a landmark policy shift, led by Saudi Arabia, refusing to cut production by itself in the hope that lower prices would discourage higher-cost competitors that had eroded the group's market share.
Further cementing the impression of a production free-for-all, OPEC ditched its last remaining supply-management tool, an output ceiling, in December 2015.
From 2014 until earlier this year, Saudi Arabia's then-minister for oil, Ali al-Naimi, offered little verbal support for prices. The market determined them, Naimi said, but he gave no preferred range or any indication of what levels could be sustained in the long term.
Since Khalid al-Falih took over as energy minister, the tone has visibly shifted. He says the world needs oil above $50 per barrel to achieve a balanced market, and raised the prospect of Saudi Arabia resuming its role of balancing supply and demand.
Outwardly, there is no sign yet of a definite change in policy. But behind the scenes, Saudi Arabia has been working towards boosting prices, rather than leaving that job to market forces.
At OPEC's last meeting in June, held in Vienna, Falih surprised some of his counterparts by proposing OPEC set a new output ceiling, according to several people familiar with the matter.
PRICE-BOOSTING ACTION AIRED
In Vienna, Falih floated a number of ideas in private meetings on how best to manage the supply glut, and questioned independent OPEC analysts during separate meetings as to the possible price impact of a production freeze or even a cut.
At private talks with the Nigerian oil minister before the June 2 OPEC meeting, Falih was willing to revive the idea of a production freeze while showing more tolerance towards Iran, which is raising output post-sanctions, sources said.
""The Saudi minister met with the Nigerian minister and discussed a ceiling of 32 million barrels per day with flexibility towards Iran,"" one source said.
More talks with Iran led by Qatar, which holds the OPEC presidency in 2016, took place privately but they failed to get Tehran on board because Iran argued it needed to regain market share lost during years of Western sanctions, the sources said.
On the day of the OPEC meeting, Gulf members proposed discussing a ceiling.
""But Iran said no, so the ministers moved quickly to discuss the secretary-general nomination,"" the source said. OPEC agreed to appoint Nigerian Mohammed Barkindo to the position.
ARAMCO VALUATION
Saudi Arabia is by far the largest OPEC producer, pumping more than twice as much as the second-biggest, Iraq.
Even so, plunging oil prices since mid-2014 have put stress on Saudi Arabia's finances, causing a big budget deficit last year and forcing the kingdom to seek new sources of income, including taxes and other fees and to cut spending.
The government is trying to boost non-oil revenue and modernize the economy through a reform plan called ""Vision 2030"", championed by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, of which the centerpiece is the sale of a stake in Saudi Aramco.
Sources in the oil industry say this partly explains the shift in tone on prices.
The Saudis ""want higher oil prices for a better Aramco valuation"", one industry source said, adding that some think Aramco could be valued as high as $4 trillion.
Prince Mohammed has said he expects the initial public offering (IPO) to value Aramco at at least $2 trillion, but that the figure might end up being higher. Any valuation would account for oil price expectations and the size of Saudi Arabia’s proven oil reserves.
Another industry source familiar with the matter agreed.
""A stable oil price at a moderate level would help an IPO. I don't know if the IPO is the major factor – but it's certainly a factor,"" he said.
""Saudi Arabia does not want to crash the price. Their target indeed would be somewhere north of $50 - $60 or so.""
Saudi officials have also discussed the possibility that too much future supply could be curtailed by investment cutbacks if prices remain lower for longer, and are wary of the risk of a price spike, the second industry source said.
Falih has talked about the issue publicly, saying in June that even $50 oil would not create a rush back to investment.
""There's a real fear,"" the source said. ""So many conventional oil projects are being canceled.""
NOT FLOODING THE MARKET
Saudi production stands near a record high of 10.7 million barrels per day (bpd) - on a par with Russia and the United States.
But some market insiders have suggested Saudi Arabia cannot afford to push output any further and sustain it for a long period because despite official affirmation it can produce as much as 12.5 million bpd if needed, Riyadh has never really tested such levels.
The change in Saudi tone has been welcomed by OPEC delegates from non-Gulf nations - many of which privately blame Riyadh for the price crash.
""The Saudis have to play differently. They cannot sell 10 percent of Aramco if the price of oil is miserable,"" an OPEC source from a non-Gulf country said.
But despite the behind-the-scenes talks, OPEC delegates and industry sources are skeptical that the tone shift will be backed with concrete action either by the Saudis or producers collectively.
""I don't think anything Falih says means they are going to cut production,"" said the industry source. ""It means Saudi will be cautious in doing things that might flood the market.""
Falih, in an interview with Reuters in August, tempered expectations of any production cut, saying significant intervention in the market was not necessary. But he did not dismiss the idea of a production freeze.
""If there is consensus that emerges between now and the Algiers meeting, Saudi Arabia as always will be a constructive player in these discussions and we will be willing to participate,"" he said.

Crude oil for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up 11 cents, or 0.29%, to trade at $44.84 a barrel by 4:05AM ET (08:05GMT).
A day earlier, New York-traded oil futures sank $1.65, or 3.56%, after weekly supply data showed a surprisingly large build in U.S. crude and distillate stockpiles and a smaller-than-expected drawdown in gasoline.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude oil inventories rose by 2.3 million barrels to 525.9 million, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported an increase of 1.496 million barrels. The report also showed that gasoline inventories declined by 691,000 barrels, disappointing expectations for a 1.157 million-barrel drop.
Meanwhile, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for November delivery tacked on 3 cents, or 0.06%, to trade at $46.94 a barrel.
On Wednesday, London-traded Brent lost $1.84, or 3.78%, amid fading hopes of a production freeze and concerns about additional output from the Middle East and Africa weighed on sentiment.
Chances that the upcoming meeting among major oil producers set to take place in Algeria in late September would yield any action to reduce the global glut appeared minimal after Saudi Arabia's energy minister said last week that he does not believe any ""significant intervention"" in the oil market is necessary.
An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative, underscoring the difficulty for political rivals to forge consensus.

809,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2016 03:12PM ET</span>",Oil tumbles on U.S. inventory builds; best month since April,"By Barani Krishnan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell 3 percent or more on Wednesday, paring their big gains for August, after government data showed a large surprise weekly build in U.S. crude and distillate stockpiles and a smaller-than-expected drawdown in gasoline.
Crude futures rose as much 11 percent in August, posting their best monthly return since April, helped by speculation that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers might agree to curb output at September talks in Algeria.
But oil also fell this week as the dollar rallied and expectations for an OPEC-led production freeze fizzled. Wednesday's supply-demand data from U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) could herald a more bearish trend, analysts said.
The EIA said crude stockpiles rose for a second straight week, building by 2.3 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a rise of 921,000 barrels.
Distillate stocks, which include diesel and heating oil, unexpectedly rose 1.5 million barrels, while the gasoline inventory drop of 691,000 barrels was about half the drawdown forecast. [EIA/S]
""I would call this the trifecta of bearish news,"" said Tariq Zahir, a trader in WTI timespreads at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.
""We should be getting draws for this time of year. Not only are we getting shocking builds, we're also being squeezed by the bullishness of the U.S. dollar and a hurricane season that's had very little impact thus far on actual crude production.""
Brent crude futures settled down $1.33, or 2.8 percent, at $47.04 per barrel. It rose nearly 11 percent for August.
U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures fell $1.65, or 3.6 percent, to close at $44.70. It gained more than 7 percent for the month.
""We had a short on WTI this morning at $46 and we took the money and ran,"" said Phil Davis, trader at PSW Investments in Woodland Park, New Jersey. 
The market has paid little heed so far to risks of storm damage to oil and gas installations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. government said on Wednesday that an estimated 19.5 percent of crude equivalent production in the Gulf had been shut due to a tropical depression.
Traders expect further pressure on oil if the U.S. jobs data for August, due on Friday, show sharp employment gains that could bump up the dollar , which hit three-week highs on Wednesday. [FRX/]

""It’s a one-way trip, and that is down"" for oil, Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity markets strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), told the Reuters Global Oil Forum, predicting sub-$40 levels in the next two weeks.

810,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2016 12:00PM ET</span>",U.S. oil output seen rising as stock sales fund acreage buys,"By Swetha Gopinath and Arathy S Nair
(Reuters) - Large U.S. shale oil companies, flush with cash raised through stock offerings, are gobbling up properties in the Permian Basin straddling Texas and New Mexico, a trend that could boost U.S. oil output in the second half of 2017.
 Hess Corp  (NYSE:HES) and  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN) are among oil and gas companies that tapped the equity market in the first eight months of the year, raising a total $20.40 billion.
That is the most since at least 1996, barring 2014 when the energy companies raised $20.46 billion in the first eight months of the year.
The industry raised $19.78 billion through stock offerings in all of 2015, according to Reuters data, but almost all of this was used to pay off debt.
Now, an uptick in oil prices is encouraging healthier energy companies to buy up assets that will give them a competitive edge once prices move closer to $60 a barrel.
At least 16 of the 32 U.S. shale companies that have sold shares this year said they were raising money to buy acreage.
No immediate jump in output is expected since it can take up to 12 months from ""spud to sale"", said Todd Heltman, a senior energy analyst at wealth management firm Neuberger Berman.
But Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Texas-based investment firm Westwood Holdings Group, said production could increase by 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017.
""Companies are not coming out and saying they are raising money to drill more,"" Costello said. ""But the assumption is you are not going to make the acquisition unless you are going to drill on it.""
For now, production is expected to keep slipping, a hangover from the drop in the number of active drilling rigs last year.
U.S. shale oil production is expected to drop by 85,000 bpd to 4.47 million bpd in September from August, falling for the 10th month in a row, according to the Energy Information Administration.
PERMIAN BASIN FAVORED
The U.S. benchmark oil price has more than halved since mid-2014 to about $45 per barrel, but that has done little to discourage Wall Street investors from buying equity issued by U.S. oil and gas companies.
""We are in an environment where the rich get richer,"" said Chad Mabry, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets and Co.
Investors are not willing to fund just any acreage purchases, though - just those in areas that are considered the most viable and cost effective to drill.
The Permian Basin and the SCOOP and STACK fields in Oklahoma are favored regions, said Christian Ledoux, senior portfolio manager at South Texas Money Management.
About $8 billion deals have been made for Permian assets over the last three months alone.
Many of these were funded through stock offerings, including a $1.63 billion acquisition by Concho Resources Inc and a $980 million purchase by SM Energy Co in Texas earlier this month.
Some companies have said they can generate an adequate return on investment in the Permian even with crude trading at $45-$50 per barrel.  
""My firm belief is the Permian is going to be the only driver of long-term oil growth in this country,"" Pioneer Natural Resources Co Chief Executive Scott Sheffield said on a conference call last month.

""It's got the best rock, obviously the best margins, and it will provide essentially the only growth long-term.""

Prices were at around $45.98 prior to the release of the inventory data after slumping to a session low of $45.44 a barrel earlier, a level not seen since August 15.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 2.3 million barrels in the week ended August 26. Market analysts' expected a crude-stock gain of 921,000 barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply increase of 942,000 barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 1.039 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 525.9 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories declined by 691,000 barrels, disappointing expectations for a 1.157 million-barrel drop.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported an increase of 1.496 million barrels.
Meanwhile, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for November delivery dipped $1.02, or 2.11%, to trade at $47.69 a barrel after hitting a daily low of $47.69, the weakest since August 15.
On Tuesday, London-traded Brent lost 72 cents, or 1.46% amid fading hopes of a production freeze and concerns about additional output from the Middle East and Africa weighed on sentiment.
Chances that the upcoming meeting among major oil producers in late September would yield any action to reduce the global glut appeared minimal after Saudi Arabia's energy minister said last week that he does not believe any ""significant intervention"" in the oil market is necessary.
His reported comments come ahead of an informal meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Algeria late next month, during which major oil producers are expected to discuss a potential output freeze.
However, analysts and traders remain skeptical the meeting would result in a coherent effort to reduce the global glut.
Crude prices soared almost $10 a barrel, or nearly 25%, in the first three weeks of August, as the prospect of an output freeze by major producers at an informal OPEC meeting in Algeria next month sparked a massive rally.
An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative, underscoring the difficulty for political rivals to forge consensus.

Natural gas for delivery in October on the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up 1.9 cents, or 0.67%, to trade at $2.846 per million British thermal units by 9:36AM ET (13:36GMT).
On Tuesday, futures sank 6.9 cents, or 2.38%, as a tropical depression moved away from the Gulf of Mexico, easing concerns over a disruption to supplies.
Market players looked ahead to weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build of approximately 35 billion cubic feet in the week ended August 26.
That compares with a gain of 11 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 96 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 67 billion cubic feet.
Total gas in storage currently stands at 3.350 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 8.3% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 8.2% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Some market analysts said persistent heat late into the season could push power generators to continue burning gas.
Unless intense late-summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles could possibly test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
Meanwhile, forecasts for warmer than normal temperatures across most parts of the continental U.S. in the days ahead provided support.
Updated weather forecasting models pointed to very warm late summer temperatures into mid-September, boosting demand expectations for the cooling fuel.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.

822,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2016 06:50PM ET</span>",Turkish gold trader seeks U.S. judge's recusal in Iran sanctions case,"By Nate Raymond
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Turkish gold trader accused of conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions against Iran on Tuesday asked a federal judge to recuse himself, citing remarks he made about a series of earlier Turkish prosecutions targeting him and others.
Lawyers for Reza Zarrab, 33, filed the motion a week before the judge they want recused, U.S. District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan, was set to hear arguments over whether to dismiss the indictment against Zarrab, a wealthy businessman.
Berman's chambers declined comment. Spokesmen for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office is prosecuting the case, did not respond to requests for comment.
U.S. authorities arrested Zarrab in March and accused him and two others of engaging in hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions on behalf of Iran's government and Iranian entities from 2010 to 2015 in a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions.
Iranian-born Zarrab, who has pleaded not guilty, is being held without bail, after Berman in June rejected his request to be released on a $50 million bond and be detained at a Manhattan apartment.
Tuesday's motion focused on comments Berman made in 2014 at an Istanbul conference and in Turkish media following the collapse of a high-profile investigation in Turkey involving government officials and Zarrab.
In that case, Turkish prosecutors charged Zarrab in December 2013, along with several others, and accused him of paying cabinet-level governmental officials and bank officers bribes to facilitate transactions benefiting Iran.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who was then prime minister and who U.S. prosecutors said has ""close ties"" to Zarrab, at the time cast the case as a coup attempt orchestrated by his political enemies.
Several prosecutors were removed from the case, police investigators reassigned, and the investigation was dropped.
In his 2014 remarks, Berman commented on the Turkish probe, calling it ""inappropriate to change the rules of the game while the game is taking place,"" Zarrab's lawyers said. Berman also said ""rule of law is under attack in Turkey,"" the lawyers added.
Zarrab's lawyers said ""reasonable observers could conclude that the court already formulated opinions, prior to this case, bearing on Mr. Zarrab's purported criminality and his relationship with officials of the Turkish government.""
Zarrab's lawyers added the conference was sponsored by a law firm where several lawyers were charged after July's coup attempt in Turkey, which has led to purges of the military, civil service, judiciary and academia.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell Tuesday, with Brent losing nearly 2 percent, as the dollar rallied and glut worries grew amid forecasts for higher U.S. crude stockpiles and Iran's remark that it was on target to reach peak production.
News that energy companies in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico had shut some 22 percent of crude oil equivalent output as a precaution to threats from a tropical storm limited some of the downside in crude prices.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) settled down 89 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $48.37 per barrel.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) fell 63 cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $46.35.
It was a second straight day that oil slid on worries of oversupply and a strong dollar, adding to Monday's drop of more than 1 percent in Brent and WTI.
""Today is just another economic story that's fed the dollar's strength and with the weekly build expected in U.S. crude, prices are getting a double whammy,"" said Tariq Zahir, a trader in WTI timespreads at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.
""Yes, we have storm concerns but they are not really affecting production as much as the market bulls would like.""

The European Union relies on Russia for around a third of its gas. More than half of that arrives via Ukraine, but since ties between Russia and Ukraine hit rock bottom over Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Kiev in 2014, the potential for disputes over pricing and other issues has accelerated.
""Despite a very difficult situation, especially in east Ukraine, the transit route through Ukraine has been working well. We consider it a priority that this route is fully operational this winter as well,"" Sefcovic told reporters.
He said he would discuss the issue with Ukrainian officials, including the prime minister and energy minister, in Kiev on Friday. He said Ukrainian authorities were in favor of holding trilateral talks but Russia had yet to answer his letter outlining such a proposal. 
""These talks have always been about additional legal and political certainty that the three parties will work on this together,"" he said. Clarifying pricing, financial assistance to cash-strapped Ukraine and delivery points would be other key elements of the three-way talks, he said.
Disputes over pricing and political rows in the past have led to cuts in Russian deliveries for Ukraine as well as for the EU. The European Commission has stepped in on some occasions, brokering agreements to help resume supplies.
Sefcovic praised Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman's government for showing commitment to reforms in the former Soviet state, which is struggling with a weak economy and endemic corruption, on top of the military conflict.

Sefcovic said further reforms on independent energy and utilities regulators, as well as the electricity market were crucial for unlocking more Western funds to modernize the sector and he hoped Kiev will pass them quickly.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2016 11:40AM ET</span>",Shell's U.S deal to unlock global oil asset disposals,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell's first oil field sale after its $54 billion BG Group acquisition bodes well for its disposal talks in the North Sea, Gabon and New Zealand, according to sources, signaling buyers will meet its expectations on value.
The $425 million deal in the Gulf of Mexico is welcome news for the Anglo-Dutch oil and gas giant which has struggled to kick off its plan to dispose of $30 billion of assets by 2018 or so in order to pay for the February deal and maintain a generous dividend policy amid soaring debt.
The sale of the Brutus/Glider fields to U.S. independent oil and gas company EnVen Energy Corp has an implied oil price of around $60 a barrel, more than $10 above today's prices, according to analysts at UBS. 
""With oil prices appearing to have bottomed at the start of 2016 and a pathway toward higher levels into 2017/18 we may now be entering a period where both buyer and seller can see acceptable relative value - unlocking the A&D (acquisition and divestiture) market,"" the UBS analysts added.
Shell's Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry told Reuters earlier this year Shell (LON:RDSa) would not sell oil and gas fields at $48 a barrel in order to meet its target.
Further deals might prove harder to clinch however, as activity in the U.S. market picked up faster than other areas after more than two years of oil price declines and volatility led to a sharp slowdown in activity, industry sources said.
Shell is currently in advanced talks to sell a large portfolio of fields in the UK North Sea, an ageing basin with high production costs and strict regulatory requirements.
The company, which plans to exit operations in 5 to 10 countries, is also in talks to sell its portfolio in Gabon, New Zealand, Thailand and Tunisia, according to several sources.
The North Sea portfolio is a mix of mature fields and more attractive new developments such as BG's non-operating stake in Buzzard north of Aberdeen, a relatively new field that feeds into the global Brent oil benchmark. 
Shell is also selling a share in its 55 percent holding in the BP-operated Schiehallion oilfield development some 110 miles (180 km) west of the Shetland Islands. 
Other assets include the Nelson, Armada, Everest, Lomond and J Block fields, and Shell's stake in the Statoil-led Bressay development, sources close to the company said. 
Potential buyers include Neptune, a venture headed by industry veteran Sam Laidlaw and backed by private equity funds  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) and CVC Partners, as well as Siccar Point Energy, backed by Blue Water Energy and Blackstone (NYSE:BX).
A Shell spokesman declined to comment.
The Anglo-Dutch company, like its peers, has struggled to dispose of upstream assets, focusing instead on refining and storage assets which are less exposed to oil price volatility.
So far this year, Shell has sold $2 billion of assets, leaving relatively little time to hit its $6-$8 billion target.
""I think the $6 billion target is highly realistic,"" said Oswald Clint, senior analyst at Bernstein, which has an 'outperform' rating on Shell. 

""If you track the last 5 years of divestment's by oil majors, all of them met them. Shell have a $30 billion target and I believe they can do it.""

According to the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, gas operators in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have shut production equal to about 190 million cubic feet per day of natural gas as a precaution against a tropical storm, it said on Monday.
Natural gas for delivery in October on the New York Mercantile Exchange touched an intraday peak of $2.943 per million British thermal units, the most since July 5.
It was last at $2.897 by 10:25AM ET (14:25GMT), little changed on the day.
Meanwhile, forecasts for warmer than normal temperatures across most parts of the continental U.S. in the days ahead provided further support.
Updated weather forecasting models pointed to very warm late summer temperatures into mid-September, boosting demand expectations for the cooling fuel.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
U.S. storage levels also remained in focus. Market players looked ahead to weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build of approximately 25 billion cubic feet.
That compares with a gain of 11 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 96 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 67 billion cubic feet.
Total gas in storage currently stands at 3.350 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 8.3% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 8.2% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Some market analysts said persistent heat late into the season could push power generators to continue burning gas.
Unless intense late-summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles could possibly test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

830,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2016 07:42AM ET</span>",Oil fires cast black cloud over Iraqi town retaken from Islamic State,"By Stephen Kalin
QAYYARA, Iraq (Reuters) - It gets darker earlier these days in the northern Iraqi town of Qayyara, which Islamic State militants abandoned about a week ago after setting fire to many of the region's oil wells.
Smoke billowing into the sky during a Reuters visit on Monday blotted out the sun in central districts hours before nightfall, producing an apocalyptic scene in this desert settlement which lacks electricity amid 49 degree Celsius (120°F) temperatures.
The Iraqi military's recapture of Qayyara, along with a nearby airbase in July, is the latest and most significant advance in a U.S.-backed push to Mosul, the largest city under Islamic State control anywhere in its self-proclaimed caliphate.
Baghdad wants to retake Mosul before the end of the year, which it says will effectively end the militants' presence in Iraq more than two years after they seized a third of its territory. Some officials from countries in the U.S.-led coalition supporting the Iraqi forces have said that timeline may be too ambitious.
Yet the loss of Qayyara certainly dealt a blow to Islamic State, which had extracted oil from some 60 wells and sold it to help finance its activities.
Islamic State used to ship at least 50 tanker truckloads a day from Qayyara and nearby Najma oilfields to neighboring Syria. A sign remains on the main road announcing prices of crude in places like the Syrian city of Aleppo, 550 km (340 miles) west of Qayyara.
Rudimentary refineries once used to refine oil for local consumption have been abandoned on the side of the road leading east out of the town.
The smell of petrol now overwhelms the area, wind carrying the smoke from well fires into the town center. More than a few minutes in the area leaves one's throat burning, and children walking the streets have quickly developed coughs.
Abdel Aziz Saleh, a 25-year-old Qayyara resident, said he wants Baghdad to put out the fires as soon as possible.
""They are suffocating us,"" he said. ""The birds, the animals are black, the people are black. Gas rains down on us at night. Now the gas has reached the residential areas.""
He and other residents said oil had spilled into the nearby Tigris River - assertions denied by the oil ministry, which said the oil spills had been contained by trenches. While several bodies were seen floating in the river on Monday, Reuters could not confirm it had been contaminated with oil.
Iraq says it has put out fires at four oil wells in the Qayyara region, but Reuters could not locate any such efforts at the wells closest to residential areas.
Around a dozen separate plumes of smoke were still distinguishable across the horizon as night fell, when a convoy of firetrucks approached the town.
It was not immediately clear how long it will take to extinguish the flames. When Iraq's military torched hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells in 1991 ahead of advancing U.S.-led forces, most fires burned for around two months but some wells were not capped for almost a year.
The oil ministry said it does not expect to resume production from the Qayyara region before Mosul's recapture. The two main fields, Qayyara and Najma, used to produce 30,000 barrels per day of heavy crude before the takeover by Islamic State.
PEOPLE IN THE STREETS
Despite the well fires, Qayyara remains full of inhabitants. Whereas civilians in most other areas recaptured from Islamic State fled ahead of or during government offensives the majority of Qayyara's roughly 20,000 residents have stayed put.
A counter-terrorism officer said that was partly due to the speed with which the army recaptured Qayyara, surprising the Islamic State fighters before they were able to dig in. Qayyara is also located near a military airfield, so many residents in the area have relatives in the army.
With no power and no more fear of punishment from Islamic State's harsh rule, much of the population was in the streets on Monday, waving to military vehicles that handed out basic supplies like cooking oil, sugar and canned food.
Children flashed peace signs and some played in the black reflective pools of oil that spilled into main streets after Islamic State blew up pipelines and wells next to a main hospital in a likely attempt to obstruct visibility for coalition air strikes.
Commanders are confident electricity can be restored soon in Qayyara and said booby trapped streets and buildings are less of a concern than they were in the western cities of Ramadi and Falluja.
""We surrounded them quickly, so they didn't have time to lay many IEDs (improvised explosive devices),"" said the officer from the elite counter-terrorism service (CTS), which spearheaded the Qayyara operation along with the army's 9th armored division.
""There were a lot on the main street they thought we would use to enter but instead we came in from the desert.""
The militants still managed to put up a fight, he said, quickly mustering five vehicle-borne IEDs to attack the forces.
The approach to the city shows signs of the fighting that followed, with many buildings collapsed by aerial bombardment. The U.S.-led coalition said it had launched more than 500 air strikes in support of Iraqi forces, nearly as many as in last year's battle for the much larger city of Ramadi.
Qayyara and its nearby airbase - where the bulk of a 560-strong U.S. troop reinforcement will be based - will form the main staging base for the anticipated offensive on Mosul, 60 km (35 miles) to the north. 
Many neighborhoods in Qayyara appear mostly or completely intact, and civilians, many of whom appeared to have recently shaved the beards that Islamic State requires men to grow, said they feel safe in their homes.
After showing off the body of an Islamic State fighter crushed when the building he was in was hit by an air strike, two men from Qayyara alerted soldiers to a possible suicide bomber hiding in a nearby home, which they proceeded to investigate.

A hundred meters from the decomposing corpse, a well fire burned, spewing smoke and bright flashes into the sky.

839,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2016 02:10PM ET</span>",Oil market rebalancing could take until end 2017: Shell,"By Karolin Schaps
STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - The huge global oil oversupply that has weighed on prices for the past two years may not clear until the second half of 2017, Shell's chief energy adviser Wim Thomas told Reuters.
The potential return to the market of some 1.5 million barrels per day of supply from Libya and Nigeria and uncertainty about Iranian and Iraqi production levels could push a rebalancing further away than many in the oil industry are hoping.
""All these things when they come back on the market can again postpone the true balancing,"" Thomas said in an interview on the sidelines of the ONS oil conference in Stavanger, Norway.
He said the most optimistic scenario was for rebalancing, meaning that huge volumes of stored crude have to be absorbed, to kick in this year and that Shell (LON:RDSa) was prepared for all outcomes.
""It can happen any time between the second half of this year and the second half of next year.""
Oil prices fell more than 70 percent from 2014 highs earlier this year and are still more than 50 percent below those levels as a fierce battle for market share between major producers has flooded the world with oil.
Thomas, a naval engineer by training, said three aspects could disrupt the current situation.
Oil demand from energy hungry nations China and India will be a key driver for oil prices, as well as the resilience of U.S. shale producers to weak prices.
Any OPEC agreement to freeze oil production could also result in a sudden boost for oil prices, Thomas said.

Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum (IEF), which groups producers and consumers, in Algeria on Sept. 26-28.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell nearly 2 percent on Monday, snapping two consecutive days of gains, on caution over galloping Middle East crude output and a stronger dollar boosted by speculation of a U.S. rate hike by the year-end.
Iraq, which has exported more crude from its southern ports in August, will continue ramping up output, its oil minister said on Saturday. Top exporter Saudi Arabia has kept output at around record levels this month.
The dollar hit a three-week high against the yen after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen bolstered expectations in a speech on Friday that the central bank would raise interest rates soon. A stronger dollar makes commodities denominated in the greenback less affordable for holders of other currencies.[USD/]
Focus on surging Middle East production and the strengthening dollar also offset data from energy monitoring service Genscape showing a drawdown of 287,444 barrels at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for U.S. crude futures during the week ended Aug. 26, traders who saw its report said.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 77 cents, or 1.5 percent, at $49.15 a barrel by 11:15 a.m. EDT (1515 GMT), almost erasing gains from the previous two sessions.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) dropped 80 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $46.84 a barrel after falling more than $1 at the session low.
Oil rallied with few stops from early August until mid last week after hints by Saudi Arabia and fellow members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that they may agree to an output freeze with non-OPEC oil producers at a meeting in Algeria on Sept. 26-28.
""The market is increasingly likely to discount the outcome of the event, given, even in the instance of a freeze being agreed, compliance will be an issue,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a report.
Even so, some analysts cautioned investors against taking an outright short position on oil.
""While a price decline into the $45-46 zone is certainly possible, such a price down move would likely elicit even more OPEC hype that could temper or preclude further downside price follow through,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates.
""So, while we see high probability of some 80 to 90 percent of a return to $39 WTI, we also feel that achievement of this objective could still be some four to five weeks away"".

Despite a rebound this year, oil trades at less than half of mid-2014 peaks above $100 due to glut fears. Ryan Lance, chief executive of U.S. oil company ConocoPhillips (N:COP), told an industry conference in Norway the oversupply could extend into 2017.

Natural gas for delivery in October on the New York Mercantile Exchange touched an intraday peak of $2.931 per million British thermal units, the most since July 5.
It was last at $2.924 by 10:28AM ET (14:28GMT), up 1.1 cents, or 0.38%.
Futures soared more than 11% last week as traders reacted to forecasts for scorching heat across most of the continental U.S. through September 5 and as traders eyed potential storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Meanwhile, U.S. storage levels remained in focus. Total gas in storage currently stands at 3.350 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 8.3% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 8.2% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Some market analysts said persistent heat late into the season could push power generators to continue burning gas.
Unless intense late-summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles could possibly test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

842,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 29, 2016 09:46AM ET</span>",Gold is doing something it's only done twice in the past decade,"Gold may be worth more than what traders have decided is the spot price.
There's a correlation between gold price changes and the rate at which central banks bought assets to expand their balance sheets, according to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s Michael Hsueh and Grant Sporre.
And the pace of balance-sheet expansion — by 300% since 2005, according to the analysts — indicates that gold could be worth more.
They wrote in a note on Friday:
""Let us be clear; we are not saying that gold will trade up to USD1,700/oz in the near term, but when viewed against the aggregated balance sheet of the 'big four' global central banks (the Fed, ECB, BoJ and PBoC) the argument can be made if we view gold as a currency, the metal is worth closer to USD1,700/oz, versus the spot price of USD1,326/oz.""
To be sure, this isn't an argument for gold as a currency, and there are arguments against that notion. For one, gold isn't a legal tender that's widely paid or received in exchange for goods and services, partly because it's not as easy to print or transport as paper cash. 
But the argument that Hsueh and Sporre make is that gold price percentage changes have historically moved in tandem with the rate of central bank balance-sheet expansions, but gold is not keeping up right now:
""Over the same period [2005 till now] as the aggregate central bank balance sheet expanded by 300%, global above ground stocks grew by 19% in tonnage terms or c.200% in value terms. If we were to assume that the value of gold should appreciate to keep the overall value of the big four aggregate balance sheet equivalent to that of the value of the above ground gold stocks, then gold should be trading closer to USD1,700/oz.""
There were only two times in the past decade when this relationship broke down, they wrote.
The first was during the Great Recession, when central banks sold their gold reserves to meet liquidity requirements. The other time was in 2013, when the Federal Reserve signaled that it was winding down its massive quantitative easing program involving asset purchases.
""As long as the central banks’ balance sheets continue to expand, the gold price should maintain some momentum,"" the wrote. ""The rate of gold price appreciation is however likely to slow, given that the momentum so far this year has outpaced that of the central bank expansion.""
On Monday, gold futures traded down 0.21%, or $2.75 an ounce, to $1,325.15."

Crude oil for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange slumped 76 cents, or 1.6%, to trade at $46.88 a barrel by 3:57AM ET (07:57GMT).
Meanwhile, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for November delivery declined 79 cents, or 1.58%, to trade at $49.36 a barrel.
Oil's losses came as the U.S. dollar climbed to a two-week high following hawkish comments from two top Federal Reserve officials that hinted at a potential U.S. interest rate hike as early as next month.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said Friday at a gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that the case for an increase was strengthening, while Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer indicated a tightening is possible at the next review in September.
An increase in U.S. interest rates tends to lift the dollar, which would make oil more expensive for traders who conduct business in other currencies.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, jumped to a daily peak of 95.69, the most since August 15. It was last at 95.65 early on Monday.
Meanwhile, chances that the upcoming meeting among major oil producers in late September would yield any action to reduce the global glut appeared minimal after Iran said it would only cooperate in talks to freeze output if fellow exporters recognized its right to fully regain market share.
Last week, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said that he does not believe any ""significant intervention"" in the oil market is necessary.
His reported comments come ahead of an informal meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Algeria late next month, during which major oil producers are expected to discuss a potential output freeze.
However, analysts and traders remain skeptical the meeting would result in a coherent effort to reduce the global glut.
Crude prices soared almost $10 a barrel, or nearly 25%, in the first three weeks of August, as the prospect of an output freeze by major producers at an informal OPEC meeting in Algeria next month sparked a massive rally.

852,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2016 11:42AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Iraq plans to sell oil through Iran if talks with Kurds fail,"By Stephen Kalin
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's government would consider selling crude through Iran should talks with the autonomous Kurdish region on an oil revenue-sharing agreement fail, a senior oil ministry official in Baghdad told Reuters.
Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organisation (SOMO) plans to hold talks with the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), possibly next week, about Iraqi oil exported through Turkey, Deputy Oil Minister Fayadh al-Nema said in an interview on Friday evening.
""If the negotiations come to a close"" without an agreement ""we will start to find a way in order to sell our oil because we need money, either to Iran or other countries"", he said by telephone.
Iraq, OPEC's second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia, depends on oil sales for 95 percent of its public income. Its economy is reeling under the double impact of low oil prices and the war against Islamic State militants.
The Kurdistan region produces around 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) on its territory and exports those volumes via Turkey. Baghdad would not be able to reroute those volumes to Iran but could order shipments of some 150,000 bpd via Iran that are being produced in the nearby province of Kirkuk. 
An agreement between Iran and Iraq could function in a similar fashion as oil-swap deals Tehran has had with Caspian Sea nations, according to an oil official who asked not to be identified.
Iran would import Iraqi oil to its refineries and export an equivalent amount of its own crude on behalf of Baghdad from Iranian ports on the Gulf. Iraq has ports on the Gulf but they are not linked to the northern Kirkuk fields by pipeline. 
Iraq's state-run North Oil Company resumed pumping crude through the Kurdish-controlled pipeline to Turkey last week as ""a sign of goodwill to invite them (the Kurds) to start negotiations,"" Nema said.
He said pumping had resumed on the instruction of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi following ""some understanding"" between Baghdad and Erbil. Abadi said on Tuesday the decision had been made to avoid damage to reservoirs.
The flow of crude extracted from Kirkuk by North Oil and pumped in the pipeline has been running at about 75,000 bpd since last week, or half the rate before it was halted in March, Nema said.
Should there be an agreement with the Kurds, flow through the pipeline would be increased to more than 100,000 bpd, not to the previous level of 150,000 bpd, he added.
Nema said about 20,000 bpd would be supplied to the refinery of Suleimaniya, in the Kurdish region, and 30,000 bpd would be refined locally in Kirkuk. 
The pipeline carries crude to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, where the Kurds have been selling it independently on the international market, along with oil produced in their northern region.
The Kurdish government has been calling on Baghdad since March to resume the pumping of Kirkuk crude in full to help Erbil fund its war against Islamic State. Sources in Erbil have said splitting the Kirkuk flows would divide the Kurds and complicate the task of fighting the ultra-hardline militants.
A KRG spokesman in June told Reuters the Kurds are ready to strike an agreement with Baghdad if it guarantees them monthly revenue of $1 billion, more than double what they make currently from selling their own oil.
The dispute revolves around Kurdish oil exports that Baghdad wants to bring under its control.
""If Baghdad comes and says 'OK, give me all the oil that you have and I'll give you the 17 percent as per the budget', which equals to 1 billion, I think, logically it should be the thing to accept,"" KRG spokesman Safeen Dizayee said in June.
""Whether this oil goes to the international market or first to Baghdad and then to the market, it doesn't make any difference,"" he added. ""We are ready to enter dialogue with Baghdad.""
The Kurdish government stopped delivering crude oil to the central government about a year ago, a decision taken when Baghdad's payment fell under $400 million a month, Dizayee said.

It is also in a dispute with the central government over Kirkuk, where North Oil produces its crude and which the Kurds claim as part of their territory. The Kurds took control of the region two years ago, after the Iraqi army disintegrated when Islamic State overran a third of the country.

864,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2016 02:50PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Venezuela's oil imports slump on payment woes, economic meltdown","By Marianna Parraga
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela has not been able to import all the crude and fuel it needs this year to cover shortfalls at oilfields and refineries as state-run PDVSA struggles to pay suppliers on time, according to trade sources and internal company data seen exclusively by Reuters.
The decline is the largest in five years as the worst economic crisis in decades undermines PDVSA's ability to buy oil imports, which fell 21 percent in the first seven months of this year to 154,465 barrels per day (bpd), the data showed.
Venezuela is also on track to suffer its steepest annual oil output drop in 14 years after years of state mismanagement and under investment.
Risk-averse suppliers are refusing to discharge cargoes to cash-strapped PDVSA without being paid first, unusual in an industry in which buyers normally have 30 to 60 days to pay after delivery. Others have stopped dealing with PDVSA entirely as it resorts to bartering its own oil in swap deals, according to traders and a company source who was not authorized to speak publicly.
""We have no more access to purchases under any type of credit. We are importing under two mechanisms: prepayment and swap,"" said the source, who did not want to be identified.
PDVSA's oil import needs started growing in 2012 after a severe explosion hit its largest refining complex, Paraguana. Output since then has been hobbled.
Despite having the world's largest crude reserves, Venezuela's purchases grew further in 2015 as a decline in crude production forced the company to carry out regular imports of lighter crudes and naphtha to dilute its extra heavy oil into exportable grades.
But in 2016 the trend of rising imports has been upended as PDVSA grapples with a cash crunch that has also raised risk premiums on its debt bonds.
PDVSA, which does not regularly disclose figures on imports, did not answer a request for comment.
A 10 percent decline in domestic demand for gasoline and diesel, reported by the country's fuel retailers, has partially mitigated the need for imports.
In 2016, PDVSA's base of suppliers has fallen to 13 from 19 in 2015, the data show, as sellers grow skittish.
Shipments received this year have come from Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), Reliance Industries, Total,  ENI  (MI:ENI), Helsinge, Gunvor, Lukoil, Rosneft,  BP  (LON:BP), PetroChina, ChinaOil, Citizens Resources and PDVSA's unit Citgo Petroleum, the company data say.
Some providers, including Reliance, Lukoil and Rosneft, have accepted swap deals, picking up Venezuelan oil in exchange for refined products, according to the data.
CASH OR BARTER
Swaps appear to be going more smoothly than cash purchases.
Two tankers carrying some 1.5 million barrels of U.S. light crude sold by BP have been anchored for more than two months around PDVSA's terminal in the island of Curacao, waiting for payments before discharging, according to trade sources and Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. 
Those delayed tankers are the last in a group of 12 that were discharged after facing long holdups.
The payment issues have driven a 34 percent decline this year to 51,350 bpd in imports of naphtha PDVSA uses as a diluent. That has contributed to a 5 percent drop in crude exports to 1.42 million bpd, the internal data showed.
Excluding a few specialty components such as alkylate that Venezuela has always imported to formulate finished fuels, most products received this year have been bought to cover deficiencies in refining output.
At the end of June, PDVSA's Paraguana refining center was working at around half of its capacity of 955,000 bpd, according to an internal report quoted by union representatives. 
Products such as catalytic naphtha, ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD), gasoil for power generation, gasoline blend stock and base oils have been imported by PDVSA in 27 cargoes this year, mostly bought on the open market.
The only fuel to see a rise in imports this year was liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), used as cooking gas in Venezuela. PDVSA has bought 38 cargoes of it from PetroChina.
In the past, its refineries were able to fully cover domestic needs for these fuels.

Even after being increased this year, Venezuela's retail fuel prices are the lowest in the world and are subsidized by PDVSA.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih does not believe it is necessary for any ""significant intervention"" in oil markets at this time, he told Reuters following a speech on Thursday.
The kingdom produced 10.67 million barrels per day of crude oil, the most in its history, in July, and Al-Falih said on Thursday that production has remained around that level, though he could not cite a specific number for August.
Talks are scheduled in Algiers, Algeria, in September to discuss a global output freeze pact. The price of Brent oil bottomed out at about $27 a barrel in January, a 12-year low, in response to a supply glut and concerns about demand.
Al-Falih said there have not been any specific discussions on a production freeze by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as of yet, even though world supply remains high. 
The kingdom, already the world's largest oil exporter, started to raise production from June to meet rising seasonal domestic demand as well as higher export requirements. Al-Falih did not say whether there was a specific level of output that would be necessary to stabilize the market.
""The market is moving in the right direction. Demand is picking up nicely around the world,"" he said Thursday. 

Global marker Brent futures pared gains following Al-Falih’s comments, slipping as much as 35 cents, or 0.7 percent, over the next 20 minutes, before recovering somewhat. Brent was trading up 34 cents at $49.38 a barrel by 2:10 p.m. ET.

Natural gas for delivery in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange touched an intraday peak of $2.848 per million British thermal units, the most since August 4.
It was last at $2.826 by 10:32AM ET (14:32GMT), up 3.0 cents, or 1.11%. Futures were at around $2.829 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 11 billion cubic feet in the week ended August 19, below expectations for an increase of 18 billion.
That compared with a gain of 22 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 67 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 66 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.350 trillion cubic feet, 8.3% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 8.2% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, forecasts for warmer than normal temperatures across most parts of the continental U.S. in the days ahead provided further support.
Natural gas futures are up almost 10% so far this week as traders reacted to forecasts for scorching heat across most of the country through September 5.
According to AccuWeather, the high in Washington DC on September 1 is expected to be 87 degrees Fahrenheit (31 Celsius), three more than normal.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Thursday as the market focused on oversupply and fading hopes of a production freeze.
Global crude oil benchmark Brent (LCOc1) was down 15 cents at $48.90 a barrel by 1043 GMT, having closed down 1.8 percent on Wednesday. U.S. light crude oil (CLc1) was down 5 cents at $46.72 a barrel, after dropping 2.8 percent on Wednesday.
Oil prices rose more than 20 percent in the first three weeks of August on talk of a potential deal by oil exporters to freeze production levels to try to support prices.
Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum, which groups producers and consumers, in Algeria on Sept. 26-28.
But hopes of a deal have been dampened by record OPEC output and few analysts see the prospect of voluntary restrictions.
""Speculators pushed the price up on expectations of an output freeze, which is unlikely to happen,"" said Carsten Fritsch, senior oil analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt. ""I see downside risks if those expectations are being scaled back.""
U.S. investment bank Jefferies agreed, telling clients on Thursday that even if a freeze was agreed, ""the effects on the physical market would appear to be minimal"".
""We do not expect a production freeze - let alone a production cut – from the OPEC meeting,"" it said in a report. 
With output near record levels from many of the top producers, and demand shaky, there seems little prospect of an end to the glut which has pulled down crude prices from over $100 a barrel in 2014 to their current sub-$50 levels.
High storage levels are also weighing on the market.

But Reuters reported on Tuesday that sources in OPEC and the oil industry said Iran is sending positive signals on taking joint action, which could help revive a deal on freezing output levels at talks next month.
""We have held conversations on strengthening our position in oil markets,"" Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said through an interpreter after a meeting with Ecuador's President Rafael Correa.
Zarif added that the two countries have agreed to continue talks within the framework of OPEC, without providing further details. 
Ecuador Foreign Minister Guillaume Long said they discussed establishing a common position with regards to strengthening oil prices.

Ecuador, OPEC's smallest member, has consistently supported calls by ideological ally and oil price hawk Venezuela to boost crude prices. Since the 2014 collapse in oil markets, the group has remained more focused on retaining market share.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled on Wednesday, with U.S. crude settling about 3 percent lower, after an unexpectedly large inventory build in the world's biggest oil consumer renewed worries about oversupply.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said crude inventories rose 2.5 million barrels last week, versus analysts' forecasts for a draw of 500,000 barrels. [EIA/S]
Gasoline and distillate stocks also rose, the EIA said, driving down oil prices that had mostly risen in the past two weeks on speculation of an output freeze by OPEC.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures (CLc1) settled down $1.33, or 2.8 percent, at $46.77 per barrel.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) fell 91 cents, or 1.8 percent, to close at $49.05.
""I cannot continue to stress that at this time of year we are supposed to be getting draws,"" Tariq Zahir, oil trader at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York, said, referring to the summer inventory drawdowns expected amid peak demand for motor fuels.
""But instead, we're seeing a build in every single aspect that's quite eye opening. The Street has gotten it wrong again, with predictions that you'll start getting rebalancing of supply-demand in the third quarter.""
Gasoline stocks in the U.S. Gulf Coast hit seasonal highs not seen since 2013. There was also an increase of 4 million barrels of ""other oils"" last week, described by some traders as less-valuable industrial oils that refiners crank out when there was too much gasoline.
""It's ridiculous how much of oil we're swimming in,"" said Phil Davis, trader at PSW Investments in Woodland Park, New Jersey.
U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) were the only bright spot in the oil complex, settling up modestly after a spate of refinery outages and on concerns about a possible hurricane headed towards the U.S. Gulf Coast where many oil and gas installations were located.
Crude futures have swung from bear to bull market territory this month as renewed worries of an oil glut were subdued by speculation that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will agree to an output curtailment with non-members led by Russia at a meeting in Algeria next month.
A similar production freeze idea failed in April and analysts remain skeptical it will work now as some OPEC members keep pumping at high levels even while touting the plan. 
""There is currently a race to print any freeze headlines but we have not yet seen strong substance behind them,"" said Olivier Jakob, managing director at PetroMatrix, an energy consultancy in Zug, Switzerland.
That could lead to more market volatility, some say.

OPEC prattle of output curbs could encourage an influx of speculative capital and price pullbacks of around $2-$3 a barrel, Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates, said.

Central banks bought an estimated 166 tonnes of gold and sold 22 tonnes in the first half of 2016, making a net purchase of 144 tonnes, according to Macquarie analysts. 
This was not much changed from the net purchases they made in 2013 and 2014, but less than the 179 tonnes they bought at the same time last year, Matthew Turner and his team wrote in a note this week. 
""There is still no appetite for sales, but outside of Russia and China few purchasers either,"" Turner wrote. ""The outlook is for lower but still substantive net purchases.""
Macquarie noted that Venezuela's gold buying is a big caveat.
Amid an economic and debt crisis, Venezuela swapped and sold its gold reserves to raise money, sending its stockpiles to a record low, according to the  FT. 
The country's reserves plunged by 79 tonnes in the first half of this year, and by 59 tonnes in 2015. And so, including Venezuela significantly pulls lowers the aggregate purchases central banks made. 
""Central banks remained on the buy side of the gold market in 1H 2016, though Venezuela’s falling reserves were or will become a drag,"" Turner wrote. 
Gold has gained 24% this year, and further price increases could add more central banks to the list of buyers, Turner noted. 
Central banks buy gold to diversify their reserves. And because they own massive stockpiles of gold, investors watch central-bank buying and selling to gauge sentiment towards the precious metal. 
On Wednesday, gold futures fell 1%, or $14.35 an ounce, to $1,331.75 amid a sell-off across precious metals. "

889,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2016 05:53PM ET</span>",Big oil tankers' need for retrofit delays use of new Panama Canal,"By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - The promise that some oil traders and brokers saw for an expanded Panama Canal to become a new route for large tankers will take longer to realize than expected because many ships must first undergo inconvenient retrofits to transit through the new locks, shipping industry experts said.
The modifications to these bigger oil carriers - which mostly involve fittings such as chocks and bollards that secure the ship's dock and tow lines - are needed because the new locks that opened in June use tug boats rather than locomotives to pull vessels.
While only a fraction of the vessels that previously transited the canal carried oil, its expansion caught the eye of traders hoping to gain faster and cheaper access to international markets on bigger tankers. But even if what those ships now fit through the new locks, many lack the minimum required mooring equipment for the expanded canal. 
Although the new standards were published in advance of the canal's opening, the required retrofits come as the shipping industry is already facing financial strain, adding another wrinkle to an opening beset by cost overruns and several incidents in which ships scraped the walls of the new canal amid concerns about its design.
There are more than 900 Aframax tankers in the global fleet and around 500 Suezmax vessels, according to shipping experts, who estimate between half to more than three-quarters of the vessels, especially those built before 2015, would need retrofits.
The portion of Aframax vessels requiring the retrofits is higher than those in the Suezmax fleet, one ship analyst said.
Vessels must be dry docked, or taken out of service, for the refittings. While the new parts cost just $1,000 to $3,000 per ship - pocket change in the expensive world of shipping - additional charges associated with the work can tally up to $100,000 to $150,000, several sources said.
Sandith Thandasherry, chief officer of Navgathi Marine Design and Construction, an India-based vessel servicer, said so far this year his firm has already completed six retrofits for Aframax tankers with the new Panama route in mind.
Ship servicers must also get approval for their work from the Panama Canal Authority and vessel classification societies. 
Early on, Thandasherry says his company received approvals from the Canal Authority on ship modifications within a week's time, unusually fast. This process has slowed in recent weeks, an indication that the number of applications for retrofits is rising, he said. 
""I know for sure that the number of people who are applying is increasing after the opening,"" said Thandasherry.
In a statement, the Panama Canal Authority acknowledged that certain vessels would likely need new chocks and bollards added. 
Most ship owners are opting to do retrofits during other scheduled dry dock work. The added costs come at a time of rock-bottom shipping rates amid global oversupply.
“The current market conditions are challenging for many ship owners. So retrofit measures can be a financial strain,” said Daniel Abt, an inspection engineer for DNV GL, a classification society that approves such vessel modifications.
Abt said the retrofits are not just for oil tankers but also for container ships. 
SLOW UPTAKE
Though the new locks were mostly expected to boost container ship traffic, the canal's greater depth and wider dimensions put tankers in play too.
Only a handful of Aframax tankers could fit the dimensions of the old canal. Now 86 percent can get through the expanded canal fully laden, according to ship brokerage Galbraiths Ltd.
While no Suezmax vessels could fit through before, now 74 percent can get through partially laden, Galbraiths said, but only if they have the proper mooring equipment. 
In mid-August, the Aegean Unity, a Greece-flagged vessel, became the first Suezmax tanker to transit the canal. But that ship, built in 2016 and partially laden, may have been an exception.
Brokers said, for now, there is a scarcity of ships with the right specs to go through the new canal and that current price spreads between international crude grades discourage such movements. 
Once more ships are retrofitted and crude prices change, tanker traffic could pick up. Transit through the canal instead of around the tip of South America could save more than $300,000 on a voyage from the Caribbean to the U.S. West Coast, according to brokers. 

""It will become a trade route for sure, but it will happen over time,"" said one ship broker.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday after Reuters reported Iran was sending positive signals that it may support joint OPEC action to prop up the market, before the market pared gains on trade data showing a surprise build in U.S. crude stocks. 
Iran, the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, refused to join a previous attempt this year by the group and non-OPEC members led by Russia to stabilize production. But sources in OPEC and the oil industry told Reuters that Tehran appeared more willing to support such talks scheduled next month in Algeria.
""Iran is reaching its pre-sanctions production level soon and after that it can cooperate with the others,"" said a source familiar with Iranian thinking after a visit by Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino to Tehran as part of a tour to convince OPEC of a production freeze.
Brent crude settled up 80 cents, or 1.6 percent, at $49.96 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 69 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $48.10.
Tehran has been boosting its oil output since the lifting of Western sanctions in January. News of its potential support for a production freeze helped halt an abrupt slump in crude prices that began on Monday, after a 20-percent rally in the past two weeks. 
Still, Brent and WTIpared gains in post-settlement trade after the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported that U.S. crude inventories rose by 4.5 million barrels last week, a surprising build versus analyst expectations' for a draw of 500,000 barrels. The U.S. government will issue official inventory data on Wednesday. [EIA/S]
Despite rebounding this year, oil still trades at less than half of mid-2014 levels, with the market still worried about a glut that spurred the biggest price rout in a generation. 
The selloff has battered the economies of Venezuela, Iraq and Nigeria, which are more anxious to boost crude prices than major OPEC producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, which are keen to protect market share. 
Many analysts remain skeptical of the effort to freeze production. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) maintained a ""weak"" $45-$50 price forecast through the 2017 summer.

""The current price level of well over $40 does not provide non-OPEC producers with any kind of motivation to support oil prices by cutting or maintaining current production levels,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at London-based energy broker PVM.

That compares with a gain of 22 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 67 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 66 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage currently stands at 3.339 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.9% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 13.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas futures have recently been under heavy selling pressure amid speculation that August heat won’t prevent stockpiles from reaching a record before the winter.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

The deal was automatically terminated after the Angolan government did not give the approvals within one year, Cobalt said on Tuesday. The oil and gas producer announced in August last year the sale of its 40 percent stake in the fields to Angola's Sonangol, which holds the remaining stake. But, three weeks back Cobalt warned that it was unlikely to close the deal. Cobalt said on Tuesday it has begun the marketing and sale process of the assets. 
The company's shares had tumbled more than 40 percent on Aug. 2 when the company first said that the deal was unlikely to close. Since then the stock has pared most of it's losses through Monday's close.

896,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 23, 2016 06:13AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs reiterates oil forecast but warns outlook ‘tenuous’,"Investing.com – Goldman Sachs warned that the recent rally in oil prices was not based on fundamentals and played down recent hopes that an agreement between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be able to sustain current prices.
""While oil prices have rebounded sharply since August 1, we believe this move has not been driven by incrementally better oil fundamentals, but instead by headlines around a potential output freeze as well as a sharp weakening of the dollar,"" Goldman said in a note to clients dated August 22.
Hopes that OPEC may come to an agreement to stabilize the market in informal talks to be held on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum in Algeria on September 26-28 helped oil enter a bull market with prices up more than 20% through last Friday.
“We are, in Saudi Arabia, watching the market closely, and if there is a need to take any action to help the market rebalance, then we would, of course in cooperation with OPEC and major non-OPEC exporters,” the country’s energy minister Al-Falih said on August 11.
Goldman remained skeptical about the effectiveness of such a freeze, which could become “self-defeating” as higher prices incentivized increased output elsewhere.
""Thawing relationships between parties in conflict in areas of disrupted production would be more relevant to the oil rebalancing than an OPEC freeze, which would leave production at record highs,"" these analysts said.
""A production freeze would also likely prove self-defeating if it succeeded in supporting oil prices further, with the US oil rig count up 28% since May,"" they added.
These experts also noted that Saudi Arabia and Iran continued to focus on market share, making it unlikely for a unilaterally accepted freeze, even while disruptions in supply from Nigeria, Iraq and Libya appeared to be easing.
""Given the large uncertainty on the timing, magnitude and duration of such supply shifts, we continue to view oil as having to price near-term fundamentals with a lower emphasis on the more uncertain longer-term fundamentals,"" they affirmed.
Goldman further downplayed the effectiveness of a production freeze because “even if flows fail to materially increase in each country, we reiterate our view that the oil price recovery is tenuous.”
The firm reiterated its forecast for Brent to remain between $45 and $50 through to next summer, but pointed to the downside in their own expectations for West Texas, warning that if easing of supply disruptions rebounded by 500,000 barrels more than they currently estimate, they would likely slash their 2017 forecast for U.S. crude to $45, from the current $52.5.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil settled down more than 3 percent on Monday, retreating from last week's two-month highs, on worries about burgeoning Chinese fuel exports, more Iraqi and Nigerian crude shipments and a rising U.S. oil rig count.
China's July diesel and gasoline exports soared 181.8 percent and 145.2 percent, respectively, from the same month last year, putting pressure on refined product margins.
In the United States,  BP  Plc's (L:BP) 413,500 barrel per day refinery in Whiting, Indiana, returned to normal production for the first time since late July, adding to refined products supply.
On the crude oil front, U.S. drillers added 10 oil rigs in the week to Aug. 19, the eighth straight week of rig additions, as crude rebounded toward the $50-a-barrel mark that makes drilling viable.
Elsewhere, Iraq plans this week to increase exports of Kirkuk crude by 150,000 bpd from its northern fields while Nigerian rebels who regularly attacked oil facilities in the country earlier this year said they were ready for a ceasefire.
Brent crude  settled down $1.72, or 3.4 percent, at $49.16 a barrel. It hit a two-month high of $51.22 on Friday.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude's front-month contract, September , closed down $1.47, or 3 percent, at $47.05 before expiring. It hit a six-week high of $48.75 on Friday. WTI's more active second month position, October , closed down $1.70, or 3.6 percent, at $47.41 a barrel. 
Oil rallied with few stops over the past two weeks, going from a bear to bull market as it reversed a loss of more than 20 percent in early August on speculation Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will agree to a production freeze with Russia and other non-OPEC members.
""We continue to view a meaningful OPEC production agreement as highly unlikely,"" Wall Street investment bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
""It is unlikely Riyadh will take any freeze negotiation seriously as officials believe the market share policy is slowly but surely working,"" Morgan Stanley said, referring to the Saudi policy of defending market share over price support.
It added, however, that oil could be volatile between now and late September before OPEC and other producers meet in Algeria.
British investment bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said $50 a barrel and above were unsustainable given the crude output and fuel oversupply situation.
""Oil prices will likely experience another short-term dip in the coming weeks,"" it said.

Data from energy monitoring service Genscape, showing a drawdown of more than 187,000 barrels last week at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub for WTI futures did little to boost prices, although it narrowed the September contract's discount to October to a two-month low.

Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped to a session low of $1,335.40 a troy ounce, a level not seen since August 9.
It was last at $1,337.35 by 2:46AM ET (06:46GMT), down $8.85, or 0.66%, after falling $11.00, or 0.81%, on Friday.
Odds for a near-term rate hike mounted after Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer said on Sunday that the U.S. economy was close to hitting the central bank's targets for full employment and 2% inflation.
Fischer's speech was just the latest piece of hawkish rhetoric from top Fed officials. Last week, San Francisco Fed President John Williams, New York Fed Chief William Dudley and Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart all said a September rate hike may be on the table.
According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, investors are pricing in a 15% chance of a rate hike by September, up from just 6% at the start of last week. December odds were at around 52%, compared to 46% on Friday.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.4% to 94.86 early Monday, as investors began to price in a greater likelihood that the Fed will raise rates this year.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
In the week ahead, market players will turn their attention to a highly anticipated speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen at the annual meeting of top central bankers and economists in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for fresh clues on the timing of the next U.S. rate hike.
In addition, investors will continue to focus on U.S. economic reports to gauge if the world's largest economy is strong enough to withstand a rate hike in the coming months, with Friday’s revised second quarter growth data in the spotlight.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for September delivery tumbled 45.5 cents, or 2.36%, to trade at $18.86 a troy ounce during morning hours in London, while copper futures dipped 1.6 cents, or 0.74%, to $2.151 a pound.

Last week, oil futures rose for the seventh straight session on Friday, remaining in bull market territory, as investors continued to bid up prices amid speculation major oil producers, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, are reconsidering a collective production freeze in an effort to boost the market.
Crude pared some gains after a report showed the number of U.S. oil rigs rose for the eighth week in a row, underling concerns over a global supply glut.
Crude futures have now surged almost $10 a barrel, or nearly 25% from their Aug. 2 lows, officially charging into a bull market, as the prospect of an output freeze by major producers sparked a massive rally.
The market started to recover a little over two weeks ago, when Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said the country would work with other oil producers to stabilize prices at an informal OPEC meeting in Algeria next month.
The rally received additional support after Russia expressed willingness to participate in those talks, which some say could lead to a pact to freeze production levels.
However, market analysts remained skeptical that the meeting would result in any concrete actions.
An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative, underscoring the difficulty for political rivals to forge consensus.
Despite recent gains, indications of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity combined with elevated stocks of fuel products around the world is expected to keep prices under pressure in the near-term.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week increased by 10 to 406, the eighth consecutive weekly rise and the 11th increase in 12 weeks.
Some analysts have warned that the current rally in prices could be self-defeating, as it encourages U.S. shale producers to drill more, underlining concerns over a global supply glut.

912,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2016 07:10AM ET</span>","Nigerian militant group says agrees on ceasefire, ready for dialogue with government","By Tife Owolabi
YENAGOA, Nigeria (Reuters) - A Nigerian militant group, which has claimed a wave of attacks on oil facilities in the Niger Delta, said it was ready for a ceasefire and a dialogue with the government.
The restive southern swampland region has been rocked by violence against oil and gas pipelines since the start of the year, reducing the OPEC member's output by 700,000 barrels a day to 1.56 million bpd.
Any ceasefire agreement would be very difficult to enforce as the militant scene is divided into small groups dominated by unemployed youth driven by poverty, who are difficult to control even by their ""generals"".
""We are going to continue the observation of our announced ceasefire of hostilities in the Niger Delta against ... the multinational oil corporations,"" the Niger Delta Avengers said in a statement received by Reuters on Sunday.
""We promise to fight more for the Niger Delta, if this opportunity fails,"" it said.
The Niger Delta Avengers have claimed several major attacks but have been apparently less active in recent weeks, which has led to speculation about a ceasefire as the government has been trying for two months to reach out to the militants.
The group said it would support a dialogue ""to engage with the federal government of Nigeria, representatives from the home countries of all multinational Oil Corporations and neutral international mediators.""
It only said it wanted talks to focus on de-escalating the Niger Delta conflict. The group previously said it was fighting for oil revenues to drag the region out of poverty, floating even the idea of secession, a goal out of question for the government.
The statement was sent to Reuters by mail but it was not possible to contact the group which only communicates with the media via statements on social media, its website or sent by mail.
Like other militant groups, the Avengers has apparently split, making it difficult for the government to identify the right people to talk to.
The was no immediate statement from the government of President Muhammadu Buhari but a youth council representing the largest ethnic group in the swampland urged the government to seize the opportunity for dialogue.
""We welcome the conditional declaration of ceasefire by the Niger Delta Avengers if it is actually from them,"" the Ijaw Youth Council said in a statement.
""We call on the federal government, especially President Buhari, to take advantage of this ceasefire to aggressively dialogue with the people of the region to address the issues affecting the region.""

915,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2016 04:21AM ET</span>",Anger in the Delta keeps oil majors quiet - and Nigeria's crude offline,"By Libby George and Ulf Laessing
LONDON/LAGOS (Reuters) - Oil companies and even Nigerian officials are losing faith in a deal anytime soon with militants who have slashed the nation's oil output, casting doubt on a production recovery in what is typically Africa's largest oil exporter.
In the six months since the first major attack on Nigeria's oil – a sophisticated bombing of the subsea Forcados pipeline – dozens of attacks have pushed outages to more than 700,000 barrels per day (bpd), the highest in seven years.
Talk in the country has shifted from ceasefire optimism, and oil companies' assurances that repairs were underway, to hedged comments from the government and radio silence from oil majors. 
""People are giving up in the short term,"" one oil industry source told Reuters of a resumption in exports of key Nigerian grades such as Forcados or Qua Iboe, adding that you ""can't get anything"" out of the majors, including Shell (LON:RDSa),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) or  ENI  (MI:ENI), about when the oil might come back.
Shell declined to comment, while the other companies did not immediately responded to a request for comment.
In June, Nigerian government officials said privately it had a ceasefire with militants. But pessimism crept in, with even Oil Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu telling journalists this week ""we are talking but (it) is not an easy thing,"" and ""we need a ceasefire"" – a contrast to the belief that a ceasefire was underway.
The problems reflect deep-seated issues in the Niger Delta, which produces the bulk of oil but whose local communities complain of pollution, a lack of opportunities and what they say is an insufficient share of petro dollars. These problems are compounded by an economic crisis and a government battle with Boko Haram militants in the north.
""This is likely the beginning,"" said Elizabeth Donnelly, deputy head and research fellow of London think-tank Chatham House's Africa Programme said of the unrest, adding that ""the resolution that will come will not come quickly.""
The government this month resumed cash payments to militant groups that it stopped in February, just before the launch of the worst violence since the payments began under a 2009 amnesty. But attacks continued anyway.
A group calling itself the Niger Delta Avengers claimed the bulk of them, announcing strikes on Twitter even before oil majors themselves knew their remote pipelines had been hit. Twitter shut the group's account, but sources said the Avengers have extensive knowledge of oil sites, and follow the media closely to track companies' actions. 
""With the Avengers, you don't want to say 'we'll be back up next Wednesday', because then you'll get a bomb next Tuesday,"" one oil executive said. ""They have to be careful.""
But new groups, such as the self-styled ""Revolution Alliance"", which claimed an attack on a Shell-owned oil line, loom, while non-violent local protests have also exacted a toll.
Collings Edema, a local youth leader of the Itsekiri group that has blocked access to Chevron's Escravos tank farm for almost two weeks, said ""the oil companies have not shown any sign that they are ready to improve our lives.""
Experts warned that as long as people are unhappy, militants and their targets could evolve in unpredictable ways.
""This is also about frustrations of younger people coming up in the Niger Delta and needs not having been addressed,"" Donnelly said. ""This isn't just about militancy, though the political and economic context feeds it.""
Kachikwu told journalists this week that it was too early to say when Nigeria could increase output due to security concerns.
But the Avengers call the country a ""failed state,"" while youth groups in the region remain deeply skeptical of the oil industry.

""From the situation on the ground I do not think the oil companies are ready to improve the lives of people of the Niger Delta region,"" said Eric Omare, spokesman for the Ijaw Youth Council, the youth body of biggest ethnic group in Delta. ""The present structure of Nigeria does not encourage that.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled steady to higher on Friday, with U.S. crude posting its biggest weekly gain since March after surging nearly 25 percent in a little over two weeks, a rally analysts cautioned was not justified by fundamentals.
Crude futures have risen almost $10 a barrel since early August on speculation that Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will agree next month to a production freeze deal with non-OPEC producers led by Russia.
The rally has propelled oil into bull market territory, after technicals had it in a bear market early this month.
""We would argue that improved fundamentals are not a key reason for the recent price bounce,"" analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note. ""Crude oil demand is anemic, gasoline demand has decelerated globally, and China crude oil imports are likely to decelerate."" 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled up 30 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $48.22 a barrel after reaching $48.75, its highest since July 5. For the week, WTI rose 9 percent, up for a second straight week and rising its most for a week since early March.
Brent crude closed just a penny lower at $50.88 a barrel, after scaling a two-month high at $51.22. Brent rose 8 percent on the week, rising for a third week in a row.
OPEC will hold an informal meeting in Algeria next month with outside producers led by Russia. Some have speculated about a production sharing deal, with Saudi Arabia helping stoke much of that perception despite scuttling a similar plan in April.
Others, including OPEC member Nigeria, do not think there will be a deal. Many analysts and traders also argue the current rally will not last.
""We feel that this month’s approximate $9 crude advance could easily be followed by an equivalent sized price decline next month,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates.
""The U.S. production factor has taken on a more bearish appearance as the oil rig counts have increased appreciably,"" Ritterbusch said.
U.S. drillers this week added oil rigs for an eighth consecutive week, the longest recovery streak in the rig count in more than two years, data from oil services firm Baker Hughes showed.
Elsewhere, Iraq resumed pumping oil from fields operated by the state-run North Oil Company to Turkey at around 70,000 barrels per day, with plans to double the volume next week.

In Libya, the National Oil Corporation began to load a tanker with crude at the country's eastern Zueitina port, which has been shut since November.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) has defended its handling of an outage at its Los Angeles refinery following a blast in February 2015 after a prominent trading company told a state commission that the process had lacked transparency.
Speaking before a committee of the California Energy Commission on Tuesday, Brad Lucas, a West Coast trader for Vitol [VITOLV.UL], said that lack of information about the restart of the refinery made it difficult to time cargo deliveries into the West Coast market.
Lucas said at the meeting that ""In my opinion, there was a lack of transparency with what was going on with Torrance.""
He said Exxon kept saying the Torrance refinery would come back online ""next month"".
The explosion at Exxon Mobil's 149,500 barrel-per-day Torrance refinery, which provides about 10 percent of California's gasoline supply, knocked a gasoline-producing unit offline for more than a year.
The higher prices created an incentive for traders to import fuel into California, but only if they could gauge when prices might fall after a refinery restart.
""ExxonMobil is committed to the highest standards of business conduct and rejects these allegations,"" ExxonMobil said in an emailed statement on Thursday. ""We have operated responsibly and in strict compliance with all laws.""
Vitol said in a statement on Friday ""there was a lack of clarity regarding the restart date for the refinery,"" but added that it had ""never suggested the lack of clarity was the responsibility of ExxonMobil, nor that ExxonMobil mislead (stet) the market.""
The meeting by the Commission's Petroleum Market Advisory Committee was to discuss gasoline price volatility and policy alternatives to mitigate price spikes.
PBF Energy (N:PBF) acquired the Torrance facility from Exxon on July 1. 
California Attorney General Kamala Harris issued subpoenas to refiners in the state in May as part of a probe into whether they manipulated gasoline prices since 2014.
In July 2015, refinery outages and tightened supplies pushed Los Angeles wholesale CARBOB gasoline prices to record levels of more than a $1.30 a gallon premium to the U.S. RBOB futures contract (RBc1). 

 Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI), which operates pipelines and terminals, also spoke at the hearing.

Any increases in the U.S. oil rig count typically provide lagging indication that domestic production could be on the verge of climbing. Earlier this week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said U.S. output surged by 152,000 barrels per day for the week ending on August 12, marking its strongest increase in 15 months.
Meanwhile, market players await the release of fresh weekly data from the U.S. U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday afternoon before the close of U.S. equity markets for further indications on current trading patterns from option investors. For the week ending on August 9, traders increased their short positions by 8,400 to a gross of 303,800, according to CFTC data, remaining near all-time highs.
It comes amid comments from Saudi Arabia oil minister Khalid Al-Falih on how record short positioning from traders of late has caused oil prices to overshoot. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, pumped a record 10.67 million barrels per day in July, its highest level on record. Oil prices have also rallied over the last week amid hopes for a comprehensive output freeze by several top Middle East producers at a meeting in Algeria in late-September.

919,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 19, 2016 01:31PM ET</span>","Gold falls sharply amid Dollar rally, ahead of Yellen's speech next week","Investing.com -- Gold fell sharply amid a resurgent dollar, as investors await a highly-anticipated appearance from Janet Yellen at next week's monetary policy symposium in Jackson Hole for more clarity on the Federal Reserve's uncertain interest rate outlook.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for December delivery traded between $1,342.05 and $1,357.80 an ounce before settling at $1,346.25, down 10.95 or 0.81% on the session. Gold closed relatively flat for the week after failing to post a single move of 1% from the previous day's close in tight, range-bound trade. Since opening the year around $1,075 an ounce, the precious metal has soared approximately 25% over the first seven months of 2016 and is on pace for one of its strongest years in the last three decades.
Gold likely gained support at $1,312.80, the low from July 21 and was met with resistance at $1,374.90, the high from July 6.
Metal traders could be in store for another stretch of cautious, sideways trading next week, ahead of Yellen's appearance in Wyoming at a closely-watched speech next Friday. The comments from the Fed chair could shed light on the U.S. central bank's opaque long-term monetary policy forecast, which has been clouded by diverging views from participants over the last few weeks on the timing of its next rate hike. When the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July meeting were released on Wednesday, some participants felt that it could be appropriate to raise short-term rates in the coming months, while others were more hesitant due to below target inflation. The FOMC's benchmark Federal Funds Rate has remained at a range between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of their five meetings in 2016.
On Friday, Federal Reserve of Dallas president Rob Kaplan said the Fed's decision could be complicated by a low neutral rate, which takes into account the Federal Funds Rate minus a measure of inflation. Kaplan's comments counter a hawkish position laid out by San Francisco Fed president John Williams on Thursday, who warned that delaying an interest rate hike could have detrimental effects for the economy. Earlier this week, New York Fed president William Dudley said the timing could be right to consider raising interest rates again, while St. Louis Fed president James Bullard reiterated a previous stance that the Fed may only need to approve a single rate hike of 25 basis points over the next three years.
Investors who are bullish in gold are in favor of a gradual tightening cycle from the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates or dividends, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
Skeptical of a possible head-fake from the Fed, numerous market players have shrugged off the hawkish minutes this week. As a result, the U.S. Dollar Index fell sharply on Thursday to an intraday low of 94.05, its lowest level in seven weeks. In Friday's session, the index recovered amid heavy profit taking, gaining more than 0.40% to an intraday-high of 94.60. The index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, is on pace to halt a five-day losing streak.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2016 03:22PM ET</span>","Oil rises; Brent over $50/bbl on OPEC freeze talk, weaker dollar","By Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday for a sixth straight day, with Brent crude rising above $50 for the first time in six weeks as the world's biggest producers prepared to discuss a possible freeze in production levels.
Brent ended the session up 2.09 percent at $50.89. The session high of $51.05 was its highest since June 23. 
U.S. crude settled at $48.22, up 3.06 percent after touching a session high of $48.38, the highest since July 5.
Both benchmarks have risen more than 20 percent from a low in early August on news the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other key exporters will probably revive talks on freezing output levels when they meet in Algeria next month.
The rapid rise puts oil, technically, in a bull market. 
The rally has also been driven by short covering by speculators including hedge funds and other money managers, who had amassed record short positions. 
A weak dollar also provided support to greenback-denominated oil. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar fell 0.6 percent and hit an 8-week low versus the Swiss franc.
Many OPEC members have been hurt badly by a collapse in oil prices over the last two years. While some Gulf oil exporters have very low output costs, other producers such as Iran and Venezuela need oil prices above $100 to balance their budgets.
""With the lack of investment from outside oil companies, the sovereigns will be the best hope to raise production next year in a situation where it is likely that demand will exceed global output and that in and of itself is a reason that a production freeze at current levels still matters,"" said Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst at Price Futures Group. 
OPEC members will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum, which groups producers and consumers, in Algeria on Sept. 26-28.
But freezing production at current levels might not help bolster prices, many analysts said, particularly since Saudi Arabia signaled that it could boost crude oil supplies in August to a new record, even as it prepares to discuss output levels with other producers. 
""The latest news from Saudi Arabia is not price supportive at all,"" said Carsten Fritsch, senior oil and commodities analyst at Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). ""This is a double whammy for the oil market. A test of the lows of early August is quite possible.""

Analysts at Citi also warned of the risks of a price rally based largely on potential future talks on freezing crude output levels given that similar meetings earlier this year failed to produce any such agreement.

929,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 18, 2016 10:34AM ET</span>",US natural gas futures extend gains after storage data,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures extended gains in North American trade on Thursday, after data showed that natural gas supplies in storage in the U.S. rose less than expected last week.
Natural gas for delivery in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 4.7 cents, or 1.79%, to trade at $2.666 per million British thermal units by 14:33GMT, or 10:33AM ET.
Futures were at around $2.635 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 22 billion cubic feet in the week ended August 12, while analysts had forecast an increase of 27 billion.
That compared with an advance of 29 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 52 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 57 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.339 trillion cubic feet, 10.9% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 13.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
A day earlier, prices inched forward 0.2 cents, or 0.08%, as traders waited for the fresh weekly storage data.
Meanwhile, updated weather forecasting models pointed to scorching heat along the U.S. east coast through August 21. The weather will then be hotter than normal in the Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes region through August 26.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Natural gas futures have been under pressure in recent days amid speculation that August heat won’t prevent stockpiles from reaching a record before the winter.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October."

London-traded Brent prices rose 62 cents, or 1.26%, on Wednesday. The international benchmark has gained nearly 17% in August so far amid indications major oil producers are reconsidering a collective production freeze in a bid to boost the market.
The rally started last Thursday after Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said the country would work with other oil producers to stabilize prices at a meeting in Algeria next month.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday his country is opening up to an agreement with other major oil producers to cap output ""if necessary"" to achieve market stability.
However, market players remained skeptical that the meeting would result in any concrete actions after Saudi Arabia signaled that it could boost its output to a new record level in August.
An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative, underscoring the difficulty for political rivals to forge consensus.
Meanwhile, crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 72 cents, or 1.54%, to trade at $47.51 a barrel after hitting a session high of $47.63, a level not seen since July 7.
On Wednesday, New York-traded oil futures tacked on 21 cents, or 0.45%. The U.S. benchmark is up more than 13% so far this month.
Weekly supply data released Wednesday showed that both U.S. crude and gasoline supplies drop more than forecast last week.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude oil inventories fell by 2.5 million barrels to 521.1 million. The report also showed that gasoline supplies decreased by 2.7 million barrels, much more than the expected 1.6-million-barrel decline.

Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on $7.65, or 0.57%, to trade at $1,356.45 a troy ounce by 8:46AM ET (12:46GMT), after falling $8.10, or 0.6%, on Wednesday.
The number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits fell by 4,000 last week to a one-month low of 262,000, the Labor Department said. Analysts expected jobless claims to decline by 1,000 to 265,000 last week.
A separate report showed that manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia-region recovered as expected in August after a surprise deterioration in the previous month.
Gold was already higher ahead of the data as odds for a near-term rate hike faded after the minutes of the Fed’s July policy meeting, released Wednesday, showed that committee members remained divided on the timing of the next rate hike.
Fed funds futures are currently pricing in just a 9% chance of a rate hike by September, compared to 15% the day before. December odds were at around 46%, down from 53% a day earlier, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
The dollar sank to the lowest level in nearly eight weeks on Thursday amid reduced expectations for a Fed rate hike before the end of the year.

The rally started last Thursday after Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said the country would work with other oil producers to stabilize prices at a meeting in Algeria next month.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday his country is opening up to an agreement with other major oil producers to cap output ""if necessary"" to achieve market stability.
However, market players remained skeptical that the meeting would result in any concrete actions after Saudi Arabia signaled that it could boost its output to a new record level in August.
An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative, underscoring the difficulty for political rivals to forge consensus.

NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - A rare opening of an export window for crude moving from the U.S. Gulf to Western Europe has caused a flurry of interest among oil traders, with at least two securing vessels.
On Tuesday, global marker Brent's premium traded to as much as $2.50 a barrel over U.S. crude futures, the most since late February.
The widening of the premium presented an arbitrage opportunity, prompting oil traders to secure vessels to send crude eastward across the Atlantic, sources said. The shipments are shaping up to be one of the more notable batches of U.S. crude exports bound for Europe since a ban on them was lifted in December 2015.
Astra Transcor Energy, also known as Astra Oil, has secured the Nantucket, a Suezmax, loading heavy Canadian crude in Houston on Aug. 30 to the United Kingdom or Mediterranean, according to two sources familiar with the matter and Thomson Reuters shipping data. 
For its part, Vitol has secured the Scf Baikal, a Suezmax, loading on Aug. 20 in the U.S. Gulf to the same destinations, according to a third source and vessel tracking data. The type of crude was not immediately clear. 
A representative for Astra could not immediately be reached for comment, while a Vitol spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Those moves come as freight rates have fallen dramatically in recent weeks, facilitating the economics of moving oil abroad. 
Both tankers were booked around just 30 percent of the World Scale shipping rate, according to Thomson Reuters fixtures data. Just a month ago, vessels booked for a similar route were fixed at around 55 to 60 percent of the World Scale rate, which at the time was considered very competitive.
The export of heavy crude pushed Mars Sour, the U.S. Gulf Coast medium sour benchmark, to a five-month high earlier this week, despite a rash of refinery upsets. Traders cited the need for additional sour barrels for blending. [CRU/C]
In fact, the premium for Mars Sour over Colombian Castilla crude, a heavy barrel, narrowed to its tightest in four months this week, according to Reuters data. Western Canadian Select traded at about $2.50 a barrel below Castilla on Wednesday, traders said, making North American heavy crude more competitive. 
Traders said that Castilla could act as a spot barrel substitute for heavy Canadian depending on price. 
Exports of U.S. crude are slated to pick up in coming weeks, as outages in West Africa props up demand, according to consultancy Energy Aspects.

They said in a note that more than 10 million barrels oil were rumored to be ""leaving the U.S. over the course of the next month or so - most of which is pointed towards the Med and Northwest Europe.""

Overnight, the Federal Reserve's minutes from its July meeting depicted a committee sharply divided on the timing of its next interest rate hike, leaving markets confused on the U.S. central bank's direction in the coming months.
When the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) last met on July 26-27, some members anticipated that economic conditions would soon warrant ""taking another step in removing policy accommodation,"" the minutes showed. It came as some participants judged that market conditions were close to reaching full employment, while most members noted that the rapid recovery of global financial markets in the wake of the Brexit decision provided encouraging signs on the resilience of markets worldwide. In addition, several members expressed concern that holding rates at persistently low levels could prompt investors to search for higher yields in equity markets, leading to the ""misallocation of capital and mispricing of risk.""
At the same time, others emphasized that it was appropriate to wait for additional data to determine whether prices could firm in the coming months, as long-term inflation continues to run below the Fed's long-term goal of 2%. The members noted that by delaying tightening the Committee could have a sufficient amount of time to respond if inflation increased more quickly than it anticipated.
""The Committee expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run,"" the FOMC said in the minutes.""However, members emphasized that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.""
Investors who are bullish in gold are in favor of a gradual tightening cycle from the FOMC. Gold struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil's rally extended for a fifth day on Wednesday, helped by a weaker dollar and an unexpected drawdown in U.S. crude and gasoline but traders said the run up may not last, pointing to galloping Saudi output and technical factors. 
Crude futures have gained as much as 13 percent since Thursday after Saudi Arabia, the kingpin in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, stoked speculation that OPEC was ready for an output freeze deal with producers outside the group.
On Wednesday, Brent crude settled up 62 cents, or 1.3 percent, at $49.85 a barrel after touching five-week highs of $49.93.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 21 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $46.79.
Some traders and investors cautioned that crude futures, which slipped into bear market territory in early August after falling 20 percent from this year's highs in June, were looking overbought.
""We've gained too much in too little a time, at least technically, and I think this rally has to stop,"" said Donald Morton, who runs an energy-trading desk for Herbert J. Sims & Co, an investment banking house in Fairfield, Connecticut.
The Relative Strength Indicator for Brent was near 65, approaching the overbought level of 70, while for WTI it was at 62. Just earlier this month, both benchmarks showed RSI levels of 30 or below, indicating an oversold or bear market.
After three straight weeks of unexpected builds, U.S. crude stockpiles fell 2.5 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said, surprising analysts who had expected a build of 522,000 barrels.
U.S. gasoline stockpiles also fell 2.7 million barrels, more than a million barrels than forecast. 
The dollar's (DXY) drop, after the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to wait again on rate hikes, added to oil's gains. 
The market's upside, however, was capped by a Reuters report that suggested Saudi Arabia was cranking its crude output to new record highs that could oust Russia as the world's top producer, even as OPEC talked of ways to ease a global glut.
Saudi Arabia could boost crude output in August to new records at 10.8-10.9 million barrels per day, the Reuters report said, quoting OPEC sources.

941,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2016 01:49PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi signals it may hit new oil output record ahead of freeze talks - sources,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Rania El Gamal
MOSCOW/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is sending signals that it could boost its crude oil supplies in August to a new record level, overtaking Russia, the world's top oil producer, as it gets ready for tough talks next month for a global output freeze pact.
Industry sources say the kingdom, already the world's largest oil exporter, started to raise production from June, after holding it steady for the first half of the year, to meet rising seasonal domestic demand as well as higher export requirements.
Higher production could give it more leverage during talks in September when both OPEC and non-OPEC producers are expected to revive a freeze deal to support oil prices, the sources say.
Saudi Arabia appears to want higher prices, but agreeing a level to freeze supplies will be the main obstacle to a deal.
Some analysts, however, said using hard negotiating tactics could backfire on Riyadh. 
""It would therefore be a very hard sell for Saudi Arabia to have other countries join a collective action plan, while it is the main source of supply increase - outside of Iran post sanctions,"" Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix said in a note.
In June, Saudi Arabia pumped 10.55 million barrels of oil per day, and lifted production to 10.67 million bpd in July, the highest in its history. 
Now the sources expect the OPEC heavyweight to raise its crude supplies to another record this month as demand inside and outside the kingdom looks healthy.
One source from outside OPEC said the Saudis were quietly telling the market that output could rise further in August to as high as 10.8-10.9 million bpd.
Last week, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih sought to clarify why the kingdom hiked its production in July in an oversupplied market. In a statement, Falih explained the rise was due to rising seasonal domestic demand and customers asking for more oil worldwide.
""Despite the bearish sentiment engulfing the market, we still see strong demand for our crude in most parts of the world, especially as supply outside OPEC has been declining fast, supply outages increasing, and global demand still showing signs of strength,"" he told state news agency SPA.
The amount of crude supplied to the market in July was 10.75 million bpd, above actual output as Saudi drew down the additional barrels from its huge inventories, SPA reported.
Oil prices (LCOc1) dropped to $27 per barrel in January from as high as $115 in mid-2014, hitting the budgets of oil exporters worldwide, including Saudi Arabia, and resulting in a record fiscal deficit for Riyadh.
A previous attempt to freeze output at January levels to support prices collapsed in April after Saudi Arabia said it wanted all producers, including Iran, to join the initiative.
But since the appointment of Falih in April, Saudi Arabia has taken a softer tone towards Iran at OPEC.
OPEC sources say the group will probably revive talks on freezing output when it meets non-OPEC nations next month in Algeria as Riyadh appears to want higher prices.
In January when the freeze idea first emerged, Saudi Arabia was producing 10.2 million bpd.
The Saudis are not alone in raising production. 
Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said in parliament last week he wanted to take the country's output to 4.6 million bpd within five years - well above the current 3.6 million bpd and pre-sanction levels of 3.8 million-4 million bpd.
Iraq, OPEC's second largest producer, which said in April it would support the freeze deal, has since agreed new contract terms with oil majors to develop its massive fields, which will allow output to rise further next year by up to 350,000 bpd.
Russia, which back in April was ready to freeze production in the first coordinated action with OPEC since 2001, has also signaled it is no longer very keen on a dialogue to freeze output and would continue boosting production. 

Its output currently hovers near an all-time high of 10.85 bpd and Russian officials expect it to edge up further next year.

The FOMC has left short-term interest rates unchanged in each of its first five minutes this year.
The minutes, though, could provide further insight on the pace of the Fed's current tightening cycle. Earlier this week, market players increased the probability of a near-term rate hike after New York Fed president William Dudley said it could be appropriate to raise interest rates in the coming months, while not ruling out a September rate hike. There is currently an 18% chance the FOMC will raise rates at its September meeting, according to the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool, up from around 9% in Monday's session. In addition, the CME Group placed the probability of a December rate hike at 45.5%, up from around 42% on Monday.
Investors who are bullish in Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening cycle from the FOMC. Gold struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
The FOMC could also provide more detail into the participants' decision-making process last month in their first meeting since June's Brexit shock spilled over into global markets. At its July meeting, the FOMC indicated that it will continue to closely monitor inflation indicators, as well as global economic and financial developments. Long-term inflation continues to run below the Fed's 2% targeted objective.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose by more than 0.15% to an intraday high of 95.04.

Natural gas for delivery in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped 0.3 cents, or 0.11%, to trade at $2.614 per million British thermal units by 9:39AM ET (13:39GMT), after rising 2.7 cents, or 1.04%, on Tuesday.
Market players looked ahead to weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show an increase in a range between 24 billion and 35 billion cubic feet of gas in the week ended August 12.
That compares with a gain of 29 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 52 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 57 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage currently stands at 3.317 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.9% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 13.3% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, updated weather forecasting models pointed to scorching heat along the U.S. east coast through August 21. The weather will then be hotter than normal in the Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes region through August 26.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Natural gas futures have recently been under heavy selling pressure amid speculation that August heat won’t prevent stockpiles from reaching a record before the winter.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

Maduro said the deals were with Canadian, South African, U.S. and Venezuelan companies, but did not specify whether contracts had been signed or just initial agreements.
The socialist leader, whose popularity hit a nine-month low in a survey published this week, said he expected $20 billion in mining investment contracts to be signed in coming days and that 60 percent of the income Venezuela received would be spent on social projects.
Maduro hit back at critics from the left who accuse him of riding roughshod over environmental rules and indigenous rights in the Orinoco mineral belt in Venezuela's south in his rush to shore up his government's precarious finances. 
Venezuela has rich veins of gold and exotic minerals like cobalt, but the reserves have mostly been extracted until now by wildcat miners because of a long history of failed ventures and government intervention in the industry.

Venezuela recently settled a long-standing dispute with Canadian miner Gold Reserve over the country's giant Las Cristinas and Las Brisas concessions.

Silver futures for September delivery eased 0.06% to $19.862 a troy ounce, while copper futures for September delivery rose 0.09% to $2.172 a pound.
Overnight, gold ticked up on Tuesday, remaining near 28-month highs, as a key policymaker from the Federal Reserve hinted that a near-term interest rate hike could be possible even as inflationary pressures remain soft.
On Tuesday morning, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said its Consumer Price Index remained flat in July, in line with consensus forecasts, falling back slightly from a monthly gain of 0.2% in June. On an annual basis, consumer inflation rose by 0.8% from the previous 12 months, also slowing from June's yearly increase of 1.0%. It came as food prices remained flat and transportation experienced a slight contraction, offset by strength in medical and housing prices.
At the same time, Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose by 0.1% in July, slightly below analysts' expectations for a 0.2% gain. Core Inflation increased by 2.2% on a year-over-year basis, also slowing from June's yearly gains of 2.3%. For the month, volatile energy prices declined by 1.6%. Despite strong signs of firming inflation at the start of the year, the Fed's long-term target for inflation still remains below its targeted objective.
Also on Tuesday, New York Fed president William Dudley jolted markets with hawkish comments on the likelihood that that the U.S. central bank could lift interest rates before the end of the year. Speaking exclusively with Fox Business, Dudley said the Fed is ""getting closer"" to that point when it ""will be appropriate"" to actually raise short-term rates. Following last December's historic interest rate hike, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has held the targeted range of its benchmark interest rate at its current level between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its first five meetings this year.
The chances of a September rate hike from the CME Group's (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool doubled to 18% following Dudley's comments from around 9% during the previous session. In addition, the CME Group placed the probability of a December rate hike at 55.1%, up from around 41.9% in Monday's session. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for Gold, which struggles to compete with high yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil settled up nearly 2 percent on Tuesday, hitting five-week highs for a second straight day as sources at OPEC spoke of Saudi Arabia's desire for higher crude prices while Russia met the producer group to discuss the market.
The dollar's tumble to an eight-week low also supported crude prices, as did the loss of more than 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) in Nigerian output to militant attacks and pipeline problems. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will probably revive talks on freezing oil output levels when it meets non-OPEC nations next month, OPEC sources told Reuters, citing Saudi Arabia's wish for higher prices.
Russian and OPEC energy officials discussed oil markets at a meeting in Vienna, Russia's Energy Ministry said. Another ""energy dialogue"" between Russia and OPEC has been scheduled there for October.
""While it is tempting to dismiss the OPEC chatter as a non-factor intended to talk up prices, we are also resigning to a momentum shift in which our technical indicators are flashing green lights in favor of further crude price rallies of at least a couple of dollars a barrel,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates.
Brent crude settled up 88 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $49.23 a barrel. It rose more after settlement, reaching $49.36, its highest since July 7.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 84 cents, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $46.58. It reached $46.73 after settlement, its highest since July 12.
Prices pared some gains in after market trade after data from the American Petroleum Institute showing an unexpected draw in U.S. crude stockpiles was overshadowed by surprise hefty builds in gasoline and distillates, indicating the glut in refined oil products was growing. 
Official inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. (1430 GMT). 
Technical analysts said oil could set 2016 highs in four to six weeks if Brent crosses $50 and U.S. crude $48.

956,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 16, 2016 01:33PM ET</span>","Gold ticks up amid soft U.S. inflation, increased odds for Fed rate hike","Investing.com -- Gold ticked up on Tuesday, remaining near 28-month highs, as a key policymaker from the Federal Reserve hinted that a near-term interest rate hike could be possible even as inflationary pressures remain soft.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for December delivery traded between $1,344.85 and $1,363.80 an ounce before settling at $1,356.35, up 8.75 or 0.67% on the session. Gold closed higher for the second straight session and the fourth time in the last six trading days. Since opening the year around $1,075 an ounce, the precious metal has soared more than 25% over the first seven months of 2016 and is on pace for one of its strongest years in the last three decades.
On Tuesday morning, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said its Consumer Price Index remained flat in July, in line with consensus forecasts, falling back slightly from a monthly gain of 0.2% in June. On an annual basis, consumer inflation rose by 0.8% from the previous 12 months, also slowing from June's yearly increase of 1.0%. It came as food prices remained flat and transportation experienced a slight contraction, offset by strength in medical and housing prices.
At the same time, Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose by 0.1% in July, slightly below analysts' expectations for a 0.2% gain. Core Inflation increased by 2.2% on a year-over-year basis, also slowing from June's yearly gains of 2.3%. For the month, volatile energy prices declined by 1.6%. Despite strong signs of firming inflation at the start of the year, the Fed's long-term target for inflation still remains below its targeted objective.
Also on Tuesday, New York Fed president William Dudley jolted markets with hawkish comments on the likelihood that that the U.S. central bank could lift interest rates before the end of the year. Speaking exclusively with Fox Business, Dudley said the Fed is ""getting closer"" to that point when it ""will be appropriate"" to actually raise short-term rates. Following last December's historic interest rate hike, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has held the targeted range of its benchmark interest rate at its current level between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its first five meetings this year.
The chances of a September rate hike from the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool doubled to 18% following Dudley's comments from around 9% during the previous session. In addition, the CME Group placed the probability of a December rate hike at 55.1%, up from around 41.9% in Monday's session. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for Gold, which struggles to compete with high yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.

Natural gas for delivery in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 1.5 cents, or 0.58%, to trade at $2.605 per million British thermal units by 10:30AM ET (14:30GMT).
On Monday, prices inched up 0.4 cents, or 0.15%, as traders reacted to forecasts for scorching eastern heat through August 21. The weather will also be hotter than normal in the Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes region through August 26.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show an increase in a range between 24 billion and 35 billion cubic feet of gas in the week ended August 12.
That compares with a gain of 29 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 52 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 57 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage currently stands at 3.317 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.9% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 13.3% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas futures have recently been under heavy selling pressure amid speculation that August heat won’t prevent stockpiles from reaching a record before the winter.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (20:30GMT) later on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday.
Crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped 5 cents, or 0.11%, to trade at $45.69 a barrel by 9:39AM ET (13:39GMT) after rallying to $46.21 earlier, the most since July 15.
Meanwhile, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for October delivery touched an intraday peak of $48.81, a level not seen since July 7, before turning lower to hit $48.26, down 9 cents, or 0.19%.
Crude prices are up nearly 10% over the past three trading sessions amid indications major oil producers are reconsidering a collective production freeze in a bid to boost the market.
The rally started last Thursday after Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said the country would work with other oil producers to stabilize prices at a meeting in Algeria next month.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday his country is opening up to an agreement with other major oil producers to cap output ""if necessary"" to achieve market stability.
However, market players remained skeptical that the meeting would result in any concrete actions. An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative.
Despite recent gains, indications of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity combined with elevated stocks of fuel products around the world is expected to keep prices under pressure in the near-term.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week increased by 15 to 396, the seventh consecutive weekly rise and the 10th increase in 11 weeks.
The continued increase in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the months ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.

The U.S. Commerce Department said that consumer prices were unchanged in July from a month earlier, compared to expectations for a 0.1% gain. CPI, excluding the volatile food and energy components, inched up 0.1%. In the 12 months through July, core CPI rose 2.2%.
At the same time, the Commerce Department said housing starts climbed 2.1% last month to an annual pace of 1.21 million, while building permits dipped 0.1% to 1.15 million.
The disappointing report led investors to push back expectations for the next U.S. rate hike. Fed funds futures are currently pricing in just a 9% chance of a rate hike by September. December odds were at around 42%.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, slumped to a seven-week low of 94.38. It was last at 94.80, down 0.8% on the day.
Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.

For the year, the precious metal is up nearly 26%, boosted by concerns over global growth and expectations of monetary stimulus.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Soros Fund Management LLC sharply cut its shares in gold in the second quarter, when bullion prices rose to two-year highs, regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed on Monday.
The fund, which returned to the world's biggest gold exchange-traded fund SPDR Gold Trust (P:GLD) in the first quarter of 2016 after a three-year absence, sharply cut his stake in the second quarter.
Billionaire financier George Soros' fund reduced its holdings in SPDR Gold Trust to 240,000 shares worth $30.4 million, from 1.05 million shares worth $123.5 million in the first quarter.
Soros also drastically cut its stake in  Barrick Gold Corp  (TO:ABX) to 1.07 million shares worth $22.9 million, from 19.4 million shares in the first three months of 2016, the filing showed.
""Investors have been more proactive cutting holdings in the miners, some of whom have drastically outperformed the underlying in the first half of the year,"" said Tai Wong, director of base and precious metals trading for BMO Capital Markets in New York. 
""It may not suggest that they are necessarily bearish gold but rather taking opportune profit.""
The move came as spot gold prices  rose 7 percent in the second quarter, following a 16 percent surge in the first quarter, the strongest in nearly three decades as expectations for a U.S. interest rate hike faded.
Prices rallied in June, when the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.
New York-based Paulson & Co, led by John Paulson, kept its stake in SPDR Gold Trust unchanged in the second quarter at 4.78 million shares worth $603.9 million. They were worth nearly $562 million in the first quarter, a May 13F filing showed.

Paulson held stakes unchanged in IAMGOLD Corp (TO:IMG) and RandGold Resources (L:RRS), and cut them in AngloGold Ashanti (J:ANGJ) and NovaGold Resources Inc (TO:NG), the filings showed.

Crude futures extended last week's rally on Monday after reports surfaced that Russia could consider meeting with top producers from OPEC in a potential attempt to coordinate joint oil market stabilization. The comments come days after Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih sparked a rally last week by suggesting that OPEC producers could meet on the sidelines of next month's International Energy Forum (IEF) in Algeria, their first informal meeting since the 14-member cartel left its production ceiling unchanged at a closely-watched meeting in June.
Weeks earlier, a coordinated production freeze between Saudi Arabia, Russia and two other major producers collapsed after the Saudi kingdom insisted that main rival Iran take part in any agreement that required the participants to cap output at levels from early-2016.
""With regard to the cooperation with Saudi Arabia, the dialogue between our two countries is developing in a tangible way, whether in the framework of a multi-party structure or on a bilateral level,"" Novak told Saudi state-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat. ""We are cooperating in the framework of consultations regarding the oil market with OPEC countries and producers from outside the organization, and are determined to continue dialogue to achieve market stability.""
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, could be willing to freeze output at its current levels given that the kingdom pumped 10.67 million barrels per day of oil last month, its highest amount on record. Iran, which boosted production to 3.65 million bpd in July, has plans to increase output over the next five years until it reaches a target of 4.6 million bpd, according to comments made by energy minister Bijan Zanganeh before the Islamic Consultative Assembly, also known as the Iranian Parliament.

966,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2016 08:00PM ET</span>",Icahn urges EPA to change renewable fuel credit market,"(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn has called on the top U.S. environmental regulator to make changes to a market for renewable fuel credits or else risk ""the mother of all short squeezes"" that could bankrupt refiners.
In a letter to Environmental Protection Agency administrators seen by Reuters on Monday, Icahn said ""a number"" of refiners could go bankrupt if the playing field is not leveled to stop disfavoring independent refiners such as  CVR Energy Inc  (N:CVI), in which Icahn owns an 82 percent stake.
Icahn expressed worries about the market for renewable identification number (RIN) credits, which the EPA calls the ""currency"" of a renewable fuel standard program designed to reduce reliance on imported oil and the emission of greenhouse gases.
""The RIN market is the quintessential example of a 'rigged' market where large gas station chains, big oil companies and large speculators are assured to make windfall profits at the expense of small and midsized independent refineries which have been designated the 'obligated parties' to deliver RINs,"" Icahn wrote.
""As a result, the RIN market has become 'the mother of all short squeezes,'"" he added. ""It is not too late to fix this problem if the EPA acts quickly.""
Spokespeople for the EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment after business hours on Monday. Icahn's August 9 letter was previously reported by Bloomberg News.
Oil refiners and importers are required to prove compliance with the renewable fuel mandate by either blending biofuels or buying RIN credits from companies that are in compliance. But the cost of the credits has risen this year as supply fell, while the EPA set more ambitious targets for blending. This can hurt refiners that do not have blending or retail outlets and need to buy RINs.
In the first half of 2016, 10 refinery owners including Marathon Petroleum Corp (N:MPC) spent at least $1.1 billion buying RINs, putting them on track to far exceed the record $1.3 billion they spent in 2013.

""RINs continue to be an egregious tax on our business and have become our single largest operating expense, exceeding labor, maintenance and energy costs,""  CVR Refining LP  (N:CVRR)Chief Executive Jack Lipinski said last month.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for December delivery gained 0.10% to $1,345.90 a troy ounce.
Silver futures for September delivery edged up 0.14% to $19.848 a troy ounce, while copper futures for September delivery rose by 0.05% to 2.151 a pound.
Overnight, gold inched up on Monday in quiet, range-bound trade, as U.S. equities surged to fresh record-highs amid a continued rally in crude futures, while the dollar remained relatively weak due to the prospect of further easing from top central banks worldwide.
Since surging to fresh 28-month highs in early-July, gold has fallen back approximately $30 an ounce in broad risk-on trade as government bond yields throughout the world linger near all-time record lows. Still, the precious metal has soared more than 25% over the first seven months of 2016 and is on pace for one of its strongest years in the last three decades.
Investors on Monday continued to monitor global central bank activity closely ahead of next week's Jackson Hole Summit for leading central bankers in Wyoming. On Monday, the Nikkei fell 0.3% amid subdued economic growth in Japan over the three-month period through June, exacerbating concerns that further stimulus plans could be forthcoming before the end of the year. Over the quarter, Japan's economy grew at a rate of 0.2% over the prior 12 months, sharply below forecasts of a 0.7% increase and marking a considerable slowdown from gains of 2% over the first three months of the year. The subdued report comes in the wake of the launch of a ¥28 trillion stimulus plan aimed at staving off deflation.
In addition, stock markets in China soared roughly 3% to a seven-month high, as investors prepared for fresh stimulus measures in the world's second-largest economy following the release of weak economic data on Monday. Last month, new bank loans in China rose to 463.6 billion yuan, the data showed, approximately half the level anticipated by economists in a Bloomberg survey. The weak reading triggered for fresh concerns of the need for loose monetary policies by the People's Bank of China to jumpstart an economy mired in the slowest period of economic growth in two decades.
China is the world's largest producer of gold and the second-largest consumer of the precious metal behind India.
As leading central banks worldwide continue to employ unconventional negative interest rate policies in an effort to boost economic growth, the Federal Reserve weighs the timing of its next interest rate hike. When the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) approved a 25 basis point rate hike last December, the U.S. central bank estimated that it could raise rates as much as four times this year at the start of its first tightening cycle in nearly a decade. The FOMC, though, has left rates steady at each of its five meetings this year amid mixed employment data and below target inflation.
Any rate hikes by the Fed in 2016 are viewed as bearish for Gold, which struggles to compete with high yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.

Only days after Falih's remarks, Energy Minister Alexander Novak was quoted as saying Russia is consulting with Saudi Arabia and other producers to achieve oil market stability, adding that the door is still open for more discussions on output freeze, if needed.
Saudi Arabia, together with Russia and the United States a rival for the position of the world's top oil producer, boosted output to 10.67 million barrels per day in July from 10.2 million in January, when the freeze idea first emerged.
Since 2014, Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader, has been raising output to drive higher cost producers out of the market and win back share from rivals such as the United States, where output soared on the back of the high oil price of the past decade.
As a result, oil prices (LCOc1) collapsed to $27 per barrel in January from as high as $115 in mid-2014, capping output of the United States but also hitting hard Saudi Arabia's budget and resulting in a record fiscal deficit for Riyadh.
A previous attempt to freeze output at January levels to support prices collapsed in April after Saudi Arabia said it wanted all producers, including regional rival Iran, to join the initiative.
Tehran argues it needs to regain market share lost during years of Western sanctions, which have been only softened in January.
Over the past few months, Iran, OPEC's third biggest producer, has boosted output close to pre-sanctions levels and has repeatedly signaled it has no plans to join the freeze initiative.
""I do not see any real chance,"" a source familiar with Iranian oil thinking said on Saturday in reference to the prospect of a freeze deal in September.
OPEC members will meet on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum (IEF), which groups producers and consumers, in Algeria on Sept. 26-28.
""However, if prices go down further, some OPEC members will try to send positive signals to the market to keep prices at least at current levels,"" the source added.
    
IRAQ OUTPUT GAINS
Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said in parliament last week he wanted to take the country's output to 4.6 million bpd within 5 years - much above the current 3.6 million bpd and pre-sanction levels of 3.8-4.0 million bpd.
But since the collapse of freeze talks in April, Iran is no longer the only obstacle to the deal.
Iraq, OPEC's second largest producer, which in April was saying it would support the deal, has since agreed with oil majors on new contract terms to develop its massive fields, which will allow output to rise further next year by up to 350,000 bpd.
Nigeria and Libya could present further complicating factors, delegates said. Nigeria's output hit its lowest in over two decades this year due to attacks on oil sites and Libya is pumping a fraction of the pre-conflict level - raising the question of what level they should limit supplies at.
While Nigeria supported April's freeze initiative, Libya declined to join the talks.
Russia, which back in April was ready to freeze production in the first coordinated action with OPEC since 2001, also signaled it was no longer very keen on a dialogue and would continue boosting output.
Its output currently hovers near an all time high of 10.85 and Russian officials expect it to edge up further next year.
And even Saudi Arabia itself has raised its output to record levels in July, which Falih has explained was due to rising seasonal domestic demand and customers asking for more oil worldwide.
These increases arise as countries which usually do not join any global actions such as North American producers are expected to add more barrels. The International Energy Agency expects non-OPEC output to rise by 300,000 bpd next year after a decline of 900,000 bpd in 2015 as North American output stabilizes.
Hence, persuading countries such as Iran, Iraq and Russia to return to output controls will be a difficult task for Riyadh but a worst option would be to raise expectations of a deal that doesn't happen, like in April.

""No agreement will collapse the market, and OPEC,"" said the first OPEC source.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for September delivery traded between $44.38 and $45.77 a barrel before closing at $45.72, up 1.23 or 2.76% on the session. The front month contract for U.S. crude closed higher for the fourth straight session and the fifth time in the last seven trading days. With the sharp gains, WTI crude eclipsed $45 a barrel for the first time since July 20. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for October delivery wavered between $46.84 and $48.39 a barrel, before settling at $48.33, up 1.36 or 2.90% on the day. Brent futures cleared $48 for the first time since July 15.
Both the U.S. and international benchmarks of crude are coming off their strongest week since the spring, soaring approximately 5% last week.
Crude futures extended last week's rally on Monday after reports surfaced that Russia could consider meeting with top producers from OPEC in a potential attempt to coordinate joint oil market stabilization. The comments come days after Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih sparked a rally last week by suggesting that OPEC producers could meet on the sidelines of next month's International Energy Forum (IEF) in Algeria, their first informal meeting since the 14-member cartel left its production ceiling unchanged at a closely-watched meeting in June. Weeks earlier, a coordinated production freeze between Saudi Arabia, Russia and two other major producers collapsed after the Saudi kingdom insisted that main rival Iran take part in any agreement that required the participants to cap output at levels from early-2016.
""With regard to the cooperation with Saudi Arabia, the dialogue between our two countries is developing in a tangible way, whether in the framework of a multi-party structure or on a bilateral level,"" Novak told Saudi state-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat. ""We are cooperating in the framework of consultations regarding the oil market with OPEC countries and producers from outside the organization, and are determined to continue dialogue to achieve market stability.""
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, could be willing to freeze output at its current levels given that the kingdom pumped 10.67 million barrels per day of oil last month, its highest amount on record. Iran, which boosted production to 3.65 million bpd in July, has plans to increase output over the next five years until it reaches a target of 4.6 million bpd, according to comments made by energy minister Bijan Zanganeh before the Islamic Consultative Assembly, also known as the Iranian Parliament. The comments were reported by Iran's FARS News Agency.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell by more than 0.15% to an intraday low of 95.43. Since hitting a four-month high at 97.62 in late-July, the Dollar has retreated by approximately 2%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jana Partners dissolved its share stake in the world's biggest gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the second quarter of 2016 as bullion prices rose to two-year highs, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings showed on Monday.
The move came after Jana Partners, led by activist investor Barry Rosenstein, returned to gold in the first quarter along with other investors as spot gold prices saw their best quarterly performance in nearly three decades.
In the second quarter, Jana Partners dissolved the 50,000 shares of SPDR Gold Trust, the world's biggest gold ETF, that it bought in the first quarter when they were valued at $5.89 million.
Inflows into SPDR increased by 16 percent to a three-year high in the second quarter. [GOL/ETF]
Higher gold prices typically attract investment money to bullion, often seen as a hedge against inflation, and spot prices rose around 7 percent in the second quarter to $1,358.20 an ounce, extending on the 16 percent gains of the first quarter.
It was a choppy quarter, however, with prices down in May but up again in June, when the U.K. voted to leave the European Union.
""Gold had rallied quite significantly by that point of time so you had people questioning their entry point,"" said Steven Dunn, executive director, head of distribution for ETF Securities (US).
Jana may have used the opportunity to take profits, Dunn said.
Meanwhile, inflows of the eight gold-back ETFs followed by Reuters rose to the highest in nearly three years.
Monday's 13F filings showed CI Investments Inc, an investment manager of Toronto-based CI Financial Corp, reported earlier this month that it increased its shares in gold.
In the second quarter, it more than doubled its shares in SPDR Gold Trust to 9.4 million shares worth $1.19 billion, becoming the second-biggest shareholder by June 30.
It was the sixth-largest shareholder in the first quarter.

Caxton Corp remained out of gold for the third straight quarter.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for December delivery traded between $1,341.00 and $1,349.05 an ounce before settling at $1,347.75, up 4.55 or 0.34% on the session. Since surging to fresh 28-month highs in early-July, Gold has fallen back approximately $30 an ounce in broad risk-on trade as government bond yields throughout the world linger near all-time record lows. Still, the precious metal has soared more than 25% over the first seven months of 2016 and is on pace for one of its strongest years in the last three decades.
Investors on Monday continued to monitor global central bank activity closely ahead of next week's Jackson Hole Summit for leading central bankers in Wyoming. On Monday, the Nikkei fell 0.3% amid subdued economic growth in Japan over the three-month period through June, exacerbating concerns that further stimulus plans could be forthcoming before the end of the year. Over the quarter, Japan's economy grew at a rate of 0.2% over the prior 12 months, sharply below forecasts of a 0.7% increase and marking a considerable slowdown from gains of 2% over the first three months of the year. The subdued report comes in the wake of the launch of a ¥28 trillion stimulus plan aimed at staving off deflation.
In addition, stock markets in China soared roughly 3% to a seven-month high, as investors prepared for fresh stimulus measures in the world's second-largest economy following the release of weak economic data on Monday. Last month, new bank loans in China rose to 463.6 billion yuan, the data showed, approximately half the level anticipated by economists in a Bloomberg survey. The weak reading triggered for fresh concerns of the need for loose monetary policies by the People's Bank of China to jumpstart an economy mired in the slowest period of economic growth in two decades.
China is the world's largest producer of gold and the second-largest consumer of the precious metal behind India.
As leading central banks worldwide continue to employ unconventional negative interest rate policies in an effort to boost economic growth, the Federal Reserve weighs the timing of its next interest rate hike. When the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) approved a 25 basis point rate hike last December, the U.S. central bank estimated that it could raise rates as much as four times this year at the start of its first tightening cycle in nearly a decade. The FOMC, though, has left rates steady at each of its five meetings this year amid mixed employment data and below target inflation.
Any rate hikes by the Fed in 2016 are viewed as bearish for Gold, which struggles to compete with high yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
Meanwhile, all three major indices on Wall Street hit fresh record-highs early in Monday's session, as oil futures hit 3-week highs. U.S. stocks have remained in record territory throughout the summer after staging an unexpected rebound during the early stages of the Post-Brexit crisis.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell by more than 0.15% to an intraday low of 95.43. Since hitting a four-month high at 97.62 in late-July, the Dollar has retreated by approximately 2%.

Natural gas for delivery in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 4.5 cents, or 1.74%, to trade at $2.631 per million British thermal units by 14:25GMT, or 10:25AM ET.
On Friday, prices sank to $2.523, a level not seen since June 9, before turning higher as traders reacted to forecasts for scorching eastern heat that would boost demand for the cooling fuel.
Sentiment on the cooling fuel improved after weather forecasting models showed that the weather will probably be hotter than normal in the Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes region through August 26.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Natural gas futures lost 6.7% last week amid speculation that August heat won’t prevent stockpiles from reaching a record before the winter.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.317 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.9% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 13.3% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

London-traded Brent futures surged $2.70, or 5.74%, last week, marking the best weekly gain in over four months, amid growing expectations of producer action at an OPEC meeting in Algeria next month.
Elsewhere, crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 88 cents, or 1.98%, to trade at $45.37 a barrel after touching a session high of $45.41, a level not seen since July 21.
New York-traded oil futures soared $2.69, or 6.04%, last week, the largest weekly gain since April.
Crude prices are up nearly 10% so far this month. Sentiment on oil received a leg up after comments from Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, late last week appeared to lend more credibility to the idea that OPEC might consider taking action to stabilize prices at a meeting in Algeria next month.
However, market players remained skeptical that the meeting would result in any concrete actions. An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative.
Despite recent gains, indications of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity combined with elevated stocks of fuel products around the world is expected to keep prices under pressure in the near-term.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week increased by 15 to 396, the seventh consecutive weekly rise and the 10th increase in 11 weeks.
The continued increase in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the months ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.

In the week ahead, market players will be turning their attention to Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s July policy meeting for fresh clues on the timing of the next U.S. rate hike.
U.S. inflation data will also be in focus, as investors attempt to gauge if the world's largest economy is strong enough to withstand an increase in borrowing costs in the coming months.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
For the year, the precious metal is up nearly 26%, boosted by concerns over global growth and expectations of monetary stimulus.

Luaibi is one of six candidates Abadi nominated to fill vacant ministerial jobs. Parliament approved five of them including Luaibi, in a session in Baghdad, state TV said. The only rejected nominee was Abadi's pick for trade minister.
South Oil is the company that produces most of the OPEC nation's crude.
Abadi announced earlier this year his intention to overhaul the cabinet by appointing independent technocrats as ministers.
The move is part of a plan to combat rampant corruption that thrives on a system of patronage that allows large political groups to amass wealth and influence.
Demonstrations held by supporters of powerful Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in support of anti-graft reforms turned violent in May, after influential political groups blocked Abadi's plan.
Luaibi was on a previous list of ministerial candidates, blocked by parliament in April.
Members of parliament were also scheduled on Monday to question Defence Minister Khaled al-Obeidi, whose post is not one of those Abadi was seeking to change, over alleged corruption involving weapons contracts.

981,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2016 01:40AM ET</span>","Lack of investment, payment delays hamper Venezuela oil output","By Marianna Parraga
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela, which holds the world's largest crude reserves, is on track to suffer its steepest annual oil output drop in 14 years as it suffers the effects of an economic crisis and years of under investment and mismanagement, according to data seen by Reuters and interviews with company sources and workers.
The state-run oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), is struggling to stem a production decline that has accelerated this year as a result of payment delays to suppliers, lack of investment in equipment, and poor planning in the country's vast oil fields.
In the 12 months to June, Venezuela's crude output fell 9 percent to 2.36 million barrels per day (bpd), while the Organization of Petroleum Exploration Countries (OPEC) has boosted its output by 4 percent, according to the group's official figures. 
Venezuela's oil minister and PDVSA president, Eulogio Del Pino, last month confirmed a 220,000-barrel-per-day production decline -- around 8 percent -- so far this year compared with 2015.
However, he said the ""circumstantial fall"" had been ""contained."" The Oil Ministry later said the country's output rebounded in July to 2.54 million bpd, without giving comparative figures. The data have not yet been reported to OPEC.
PDVSA's statistics have been a matter of debate for years.
Internal trade and supply data seen by Reuters show that PDVSA's crude exports, which account for 94 percent of the country's hard currency income, fell to 1.19 million bpd in July, excluding independent sales made by its joint ventures.
PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment on its sales to customers.
Several PDVSA workers and local union members, in interviews with Reuters, said that an increase in equipment theft, maintenance delays, low salaries, and what they called a sense of ""abandonment"" of some oilfields are continuing to hit production. 
""I have never seen so much inefficiency in my 28 years in the oil industry,"" said a worker of a drilling firm hired by Petroboscan, a project with participation of U.S.  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) that is one of more than 40 joint ventures by PDVSA and foreign firms. 
Del Pino told local media last month that power outages and limited upgrading capacity to convert Venezuela's extra heavy oil into exportable crude has hampered production. It has forced PDVSA to import some 95,000 bpd of heavy naphtha and light crude to dilute its oil, Reuters trade flows data says.
These problems, occurring while oil services providers reduce operations in Venezuela, have analysts forecasting that production will not recover in the second half of the year, falling instead to its lowest level since a strike that brought output down to an average of 2.56 million bpd in 2003.
Venezuela's active rig count, a good indication of future production, fell to 49 in July according to Baker Hughes, the lowest since the end of 2011.
U.S.-based oil servicing giant Schlumberger noted a ""significant reduction of operations"" in Venezuela in its most recent earning release and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) said it is operating on fewer active rigs in Latin America, including Venezuela. PDVSA has said there are ongoing talks to solve payment issues with many companies, including those.
Energy consulting firm IPD Latin America in May predicted that Venezuela's crude output will average 2.35 million bpd in 2016, a 400,000-barrel-per-day decline from last year. Medley Global Advisors, meanwhile, expects an average decline of 250,000 to 300,000 bpd, said analyst Luisa Palacios, who believes any rebound will not last.
""They achieve a temporary relief, but the declining trend continues,"" she said.
INACTIVE RIGS, LOST EQUIPMENT
The cutbacks in oil services have particularly afflicted Venezuela's second-largest producing region, Norte de Monagas, where companies have been halting operations and laying workers off, according to union representatives.
""There are many inactive rigs here in Monagas,"" said Luis Hernandez, a local union representative. ""Some 60 workers are laid off for every halted rig. Some companies say PDVSA owes them money, there are also halted rigs due to lack of spare parts.""
Being a technically challenging area, Norte de Monagas's output has declined faster than the country average in recent years, particularly affecting PDVSA's output of medium and light crudes used to dilute its extra heavy oil and creating a growing need for imports at a time when dollars are scarce.
""Monagas' confined reservoirs need a specific pressure to properly work. If natural gas is not injected correctly, the output falls,"" explained a former executive of PDVSA's exploration and production department, who did not want to be identified.
After Venezuela in 2009 nationalized oil services firms, including Venezuelan assets owned by Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB), PDVSA has faced problems maintaining output levels at areas that need secondary recovery techniques such as water, gas and vapor injections into reservoirs.
Basic maintenance goes undone at many fields, workers say.
""It's painful to see how the equipment is lost deep in the weeds, including flow stations and jack pumps,"" the worker from the drilling company said.
The fall in output volume, coupled with the drop in global oil prices, has forced the government of President Nicolas Maduro to choose between paying external debt or supplying the dollars needed to sustain imports of basic goods.

""PDVSA, who has no money leftover at all, now needs even more investment in exploration and production than in the previous decade to see its output to revive. At this price level, that is not going to happen,"" the former PDVSA executive said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose about 2 percent on Friday, clinching its biggest weekly gains since April, after a short covering rally was triggered by comments from Saudi Arabia's oil minister in the previous session about possible action to help stabilize the market.
Crude pared some gains after data showed U.S. oil drillers added rigs for a seventh straight week, the longest recovery in the rig count in more than two years. They added 17 rigs, the biggest increase since December. 
Brent crude futures settled 93 cents higher at $46.97 at barrel after touching $47.05, the highest in more than three weeks.
U.S. crude settled up $1 at $44.49 after touching its highest level since July 22 at $44.60 per barrel.
Both contracts notched weekly gains of about 6 percent, the biggest since late April. 
On Thursday, crude surged nearly 5 percent after Saudi Arabia's energy minister said oil producers would discuss potential action to stabilize oil prices during a meeting next month in Algeria.
The news spurred short covering, traders and brokers said, even though the likelihood of any agreement remained slim.
""Although we regard such an agreement, let alone its implementation, as unrealistic, it is dampening fears of a continuation of the OPEC price war,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note.
Oil prices have recovered since U.S. crude fell below $40 last week, but are still more than 12 percent below their last peak in June, as brimming storage tanks and production that exceeds consumption weighs on markets.
""Despite the recent bounce in prices, we continue to believe that the oil market remains in oversold territory,"" RBC Capital Markets analysts said in a research note. 
""As such, the price path forward will likely remain choppy and non-linear since price moves can and will often be exacerbated in either direction."" 
Iran slashed its September official selling price for light crude to Asia by $1.30 a barrel, the latest sign that exporters are willing to accept discounts in return for market share.
Traders said a drop of 8.1 percent in China's oil output in July, to a five-year low of 16.72 million tonnes, also lifted prices because it would mean Asia's biggest economy has to import more crude.

""As both a consumer and a refiner of oil – the country's refineries processed 2.5 percent more crude oil than last year in July – China is thus contributing to the tightening of the oil market,"" Commerzbank said.

Earlier this week, OPEC president Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada helped spark a rally on global energy markets by remarking that officials from leading oil producers could meet on the sidelines of next month's International Energy Forum (IEF) in Algeria, their first informal meeting since the 14-member cartel left its production ceiling unchanged at a closely-watched meeting in June.
""We are going to have a ministerial meeting of IEF in Algeria next month, and there is an opportunity for OPEC and major exporting non-OPEC ministers to meet and discuss the market situation, including any possible action that may be required to stabilize the market,"" Al-Falih said in a statement, via Saudi News Agency SPA.
On Wednesday, OPEC said in its August Oil Market report that Saudi Arabia pumped 10.67 million barrels per day last month, the kingdom's highest level on record. As production resumes in Canada, Nigeria and Libya, three regions beset by a variety of slowdowns throughout the spring, market players have increased their short bets in crude futures and options, amid broad signals that the global supply glut could intensify.
Last week, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said short positions in WTI rose to 218, 623 for the week ending on Aug. 2, the highest amount since 2006. The CFTC is set to release fresh weekly data on Friday afternoon before the close of U.S. equity markets.
""The large short positioning in the market has caused the oil price to undershoot. However, this is unsustainable,"" Al-Falih added. ""To reverse the declines in investment and output, oil prices have to go up from the current levels.""
Elsewhere, investors largely shrugged off a bearish report from Baker Hughes which said that the U.S. weekly oil rig count rose by 15 to 396 last week. The number of oil rigs nationwide has increased in each of the last seven weeks. Following last week's gains, the oil rig count is now at its highest level since February 26.

After opening around $1,330 an ounce on Monday, Gold edged up marginally over the last five sessions to close in positive territory for the week.

On Friday morning, the U.S. Bureau of the Census said that retail sales were unchanged in July on a monthly basis, falling sharply below expectations for a 0.4% gain. The pace of consumer spending slowed in July, one month after sales soared by 0.6% for the period. Purchases across numerous categories largely dried up for the second month of the summer with the exception of auto sales which jumped by 1.1%. As a result, retail sales minus auto purchases dipped by 0.3% for July, marking its first decline since March.
Separately, the University of Michigan's flash Consumer Sentiment Index for August came in relatively flat at 90.4, finishing under analysts' forecasts of a 1.0 gain to 91.0. Weakness was seen in Current Conditions which plunged by 2.9 points for the period to 106.1. At the same time, the Expectations component jumped 3.5% to 80.3, reflecting rising confidence in the near-term jobs outlook throughout the U.S.
Earlier, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said its  Producer Price Index for Final Demand (PPI-FD) retreated by 0.4% in July, defying expectations from analysts of a slight 0.1% gain, The subdued reading halted any momentum gained from a stellar report in June when the PPI-FD soared by 0.5%. Core PPI-FD, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, also fell by 0.3%. The sluggish inflation data could provide ammunition for dovish members of the Federal Reserve in their arguments for a delayed interest rate hike.

991,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2016 12:53PM ET</span>",Big Dakota pipeline to upend oil delivery in U.S.,"By Catherine Ngai and Liz Hampton
NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - It may seem odd that the opening of one pipeline crossing through four U.S. Midwest states could upend the movement of oil throughout the country, but the Dakota Access line may do just that.
At the moment, crude oil moving out of North Dakota's prolific Bakken shale to ""refinery row"" in the U.S. Gulf must travel a circuitous route through the Rocky Mountains or the Midwest and into Oklahoma, before heading south to the Gulf of Mexico.
The 450,000 barrel-per-day Dakota Access line, when it opens in the fourth quarter, will change that by providing U.S. Gulf refiners another option for crude supply.
Gulf Coast refiners and North Dakota oil producers will reap the benefits. Losers will include the struggling oil-by-rail industry which now brings crude to the coasts.
The pipeline also will create headaches for East and West Coast refiners, which serve the most heavily populated parts of the United States and consume a combined 4.1 million barrels of crude daily. They will have to rely more on foreign imports.
The pipeline, currently under construction, will connect western North Dakota to the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline Project (ETCOP) in Patoka, Illinois. From there, it will connect to the Nederland and Port Arthur, Texas, area, where refiners including  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO), Total and Motiva Enterprises operate some of the largest U.S. refining facilities.
""That's a better and cheaper path than going out West and down through the Rockies,"" said Bernadette Johnson, managing partner at Ponderosa Advisors LLC, an energy advisory based in Denver.
CHEAPER THAN RAIL
Moving crude by pipeline is generally cheaper than using railcars. The flagging U.S. crude-by-rail industry already is moving only half as much oil as it did two years ago: volumes peaked at 944,000 bpd in October 2014, but were around just 400,000 bpd in May, according to the U.S. Energy Department.
Rail transport has become less economical for East and West Coast refiners when compared with importing Brent crude, the foreign benchmark, because declining supply out of North Dakota made that grade of oil less affordable.
""If you look at the Brent to Bakken arb, it's tight,"" said Afolabi Ogunnaike, a senior refining analyst at Wood Mackenzie in Houston. ""If you look at the spot rate, it's uneconomical to move crude by rail right now.""
Ponderosa Advisors estimated that the start-up of the pipeline could reroute an additional 150,000 to 200,000 bpd currently carried by rail to the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast.
Crude imports into the East Coast are now on the rise, averaging 788,000 bpd this year, with nearly 960,000 bpd in July, the highest level in three years, according to Thomson Reuters data.
On the West Coast, refiners like Shell (LON:RDSa), Tesoro and  BP  (LON:BP) may have to commit to some railed volumes for longer because of shipping constraints, although it will largely depend on rail economics. They also face declining output from California and Alaska.
Tesoro's top executive Gregory Goff told analysts and investors last week he expects rail costs to drop as much as 40 percent from the current $9-to-$10 barrel cost to compete with pipelines, in order to move Bakken to its Anacortes, Washington, refinery.
CHANGING TIDES
Rail companies have been trying to adapt. CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX), which runs a network of lines in the eastern part of the country, said it was evaluating potential impacts of the pipeline. BNSF Railway declined to discuss future freight movements, but said that at its peak, it transported as many as 12 trains daily filled with crude, primarily from the Bakken. Today, it is moving less than half of that.
In a recent earnings call, midstream player Crestwood Equity Partners said it was working to capitalize on the pipeline and not be dependent on loading crude barrels onto trains. That includes building an interconnection to its 160,000 barrel-per-day COLT crude rail facility in North Dakota.
As refiners bring in more barrels from overseas, Brent's premium over U.S. crude will eventually widen. On Thursday, December Brent futures settled at a 97-cent premium to U.S. crude, one of its widest premiums this year.

Separately, Bakken crude, a light barrel, could rise further due to the additional competition, especially as production is still falling. Bakken differentials hit a six-month low earlier this week of $2.65 a barrel below WTI, according to Reuters data, but rose to a $1.80 a barrel discount by Thursday.

Crude prices rose sharply after the Paris-based International Energy Agency indicated on Thursday that global energy markets could be on the verge of rebalancing in the coming months. The forecasts came despite indications that world demand growth for oil could ease over the remainder of the year due primarily to a ""dimmer macroeconomic outlook,"" in response to the Brexit decision and widespread easing from Central Banks worldwide. For 2016 as a whole, the IEA now expects global demand for oil to increase by 1.4 million bpd, down by 0.1 million from its previous estimate. At the same time, the IEA anticipates that global demand growth will slow to 1.2 million bpd in 2017, as underlying support from low oil prices continues to diminish.
Still, the reduced pace is more than offset by sharp declines in Non-OPEC supply growth, as U.S. Shale Producers struggle to stay online while crude prices remain considerably below their 5-year average. By year's end, the IEA forecasts that Non-OPEC supply growth will decline by 0.9 million bpd in comparison with last year's record production levels. While the IEA expects that producers will pump at a higher rate in 2017, the 0.3 million bpd increase will not be enough to outweigh the added demand.
The report comes days after OPEC president Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada hinted that a group of major producers could discuss a plan aimed at stabilizing persistently low oil prices at an energy conference in Algeria next month. Earlier this spring, a comprehensive production freeze between Russia, Saudi Arabia and two other nations abruptly collapsed after Saudi officials insisted that rival Iran take part in any deal requiring participants to cap output.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose over 3 percent on Thursday after comments from the Saudi oil minister about possible action to stabilize prices triggered a round of buying and the International Energy Agency forecast crude markets would tighten in the second half of 2016.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC members and non-members would discuss the market situation, including any action that may be required to stabilize prices, during an informal meeting on Sept. 26-28 in Algeria.
The comments by the minister of the world's top oil exporter triggered fund buying and some algorithmic trades, giving a boost to prices, traders and brokers said.
However, most traders remain skeptical of the outcome, expecting a repeat of the Doha meeting in April when talks fell through after Saudi Arabia backed out, citing Iran's refusal to join in a so-called production freeze. 
The IEA, which advises large developed economies on energy policy, forecast a healthy draw in global oil stocks in the next few months that would help ease a glut that has persisted since 2014 on the back of rising OPEC and non-OPEC supply.
""Oil's drop ... has put the 'glut' back into the headlines even though our balances show essentially no oversupply during the second half of the year,"" the Paris-based IEA said in its monthly report. 
""Our crude oil balance indicates a hefty draw in the third quarter after a lengthy stretch of uninterrupted builds.""
Brent futures (LCOc1) rose $1.49 to $45.54 a barrel, a 3.4 percent gain, by 11:19 a.m. EST (1519 GMT). U.S. crude (CLc1) rose $1.39 to $43.10.
Global demand growth is expected to decline from 1.4 million barrels per day in 2016 to 1.2 million bpd in 2017, the IEA said, after a revision to the global economic outlook.
Still, the overall takeaway from the IEA's report has been more bullish than bearish. 
An increase in Saudi Arabia's output to a record 10.67 million bpd in July was due to seasonal demand during summer and in part to meet higher demand from customers, the Saudi oil minister said.
Analysts at brokerage Bernstein said in a note they expect high inventories, especially of refined fuel, to spur further refinery run cuts in the next few months.
""This expected diminishing product inventory overhang will lead to a sustained tightening of oil market fundamentals and oil prices should be well above current levels,"" they said.
Many analysts say they see oil prices trading within a range for the next few weeks.
""As long as oil holds $40, we should be at the bottom,"" Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst at Price Futures Group said.

""The failure to follow through on bear market closes suggest we are near the low.""

Natural gas for delivery in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange slumped 2.1 cents, or 0.82%, to trade at $2.540 per million British thermal units by 14:34GMT, or 10:34AM ET.
Prices dropped to as low as $2.530 immediately after the report, a level not seen since June 9. Futures were at around $2.573 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 29 billion cubic feet in the week ended August 5, more than forecasts for an increase of 25 billion.
That compared with a surprise drop of 6 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 65 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 53 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.317 trillion cubic feet, 10.9% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 13.3% above the five-year average for this time of year.
A day earlier, prices sank 5.4 cents, or 2.07%, as traders reacted to milder weather and the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Natural gas futures have been under pressure in recent days amid speculation that August heat won’t prevent stockpiles from reaching a record before the winter.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

Crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 34 cents, or 0.82%, to trade at $42.05 a barrel by 13:42GMT, or 9:42AM ET, after falling to a session low of $41.10, the weakest level since August 5.
On Wednesday, New York-traded oil futures sank $1.06, 2.48%, after data showed that U.S. crude supplies rose for the third straight week.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude oil inventories rose by a surprising 1.1 million barrels last week to 523.6 million, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.

Protesters also continued to block the entrance to a  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) oil depot in the restive southern region for a third day.
On Wednesday, a previously unknown group called Delta Greenland Justice Mandate said it had attacked a crude pipeline belonging to state oil firm NNPC and local firm Shoreline Natural Resources in Urhobo in Delta state.
""It is true but I don't have details yet,"" said Collins Edema, a youth leader. He said the pipeline was on fire, but Reuters was unable to confirm this and it was not immediately possible to get more details.
He also said protesters, mostly unemployed youths, were continuing a demonstration started on Tuesday at the gate of a Chevron oil depot to demand jobs and housing, claiming the facility had destroyed their settlement.
""Our protest is going on peacefully today on Thursday. Our community workers inside the tank farm have joined the protest as we speak,"" Edema said.
""Nobody is going in and out of the facility since we've started but Chevron has airlifted their senior staff from there,"" he said, a claim Reuters could not verify.
Chevron confirmed a protest had taken place but did not say whether oil production had been affected.
Edema said the protesters might shut down Chevron's crude flow in Abiteye, Jones Creek and other operations in the area if the company does not agree to their demands.
Communities in Nigeria's southern swampland often complain about oil pollution and houses being moved to make way for drilling. They also say they live in poverty despite sitting on much of Nigeria's oil wealth. The Niger Delta region has been hit by a wave of militant attacks on oil and gas pipelines, reducing Nigeria's crude output by 700,000 barrels a day, according to state oil company NNPC. The militants, which are splintered in many groups, say they want a greater share of Nigeria's oil wealth - which accounts for around 70 percent of national income - to be passed on to communities in the impoverished region and for areas blighted by oil spills to be cleaned up.

1007,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 11, 2016 04:29AM ET</span>","IEA cuts forecast for global oil demand, crude hits intraday lows","Investing.com – The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned on Thursday that global demand for oil was expected to fall from this year to next due to a weaker macroeconomic context, pushing crude down to intraday lows.
“Global oil demand growth is expected to slow from 1.4 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2016 to 1.2 mb/d in 2017, as underlying support from low oil prices wanes,” the IEA said in its August monthly report.
“The 2017 forecast – though still above-trend – is 0.1 mb/d below our previous expectations due to a dimmer macroeconomic outlook,” it added.
The IEA noted that global oil supply rose by about 0.8 mb/d in July, as both OPEC and non-OPEC production increased.
Output was 215 kb/d lower than a year earlier, as declines from non-OPEC more than offset an 840 kb/d annual gain in total OPEC liquids.
The IEA forecast non-OPEC production to drop by 0.9 mb/d this year before rebounding by 0.3 mb/d in 2017.
OPEC crude oil output rose by 150 kb/d to 33.39 mb/d in July as Saudi Arabia pushed output to the highest ever and Iraq pumped more.
“Robust Middle East production lifted total OPEC crude supply 680 kb/d above a year ago and held output at an eight-year high,” IEA explained.
Oil prices extended losses after the release, slumping more than 1% to intraday lows.
At 8:26AM GMT, or 4:26AM ET, U.S.crude oil traded at $41.13 a barrel from $41.29 earlier, while Brent oil was at $43.55, compared to $43.70 before the release."

On Wednesday, New York-traded oil futures sank $1.06, 2.48%, after data showed that U.S. crude supplies rose for the third straight week.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude oil inventories rose by a surprising 1.1 million barrels last week to 523.6 million, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.

The oil cartel will hold an informal meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum conference in Algeria next month to discuss setting new limits for oil production in an effort to stabilize the market.
An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative.

On Wednesday morning, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report that U.S. commercial crude inventories increased by 1.1 million barrels for the week ending on Aug. 5 from the previous week.
At 523.6 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are at historically high levels for this time of year.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Latin American farming production and services group Los Grobo is looking to invest $100 million in Argentina in coming years, encouraged by new market-friendly government policies, the company president said on Wednesday.
""We are investing in research and development, in chemicals as well as agriculture items like seeds and services,"" Gustavo Grobocopatel said at a Reuters Summit on Argentina.
President Mauricio Macri ended years of tension between the farm sector and the state when he took office in December. Spurred by tax cuts and Macri's open market policies, wheat and corn planting has increased.
That has made agriculture one of the few bright spots in an economy that is struggling and expected to end the year in recession.
Los Grobo, which is based in Argentina, forecasts a 14 percent rise in the country's grain production this year to 120 million tonnes, rising to 150 million in the next two or three years.
Argentina is the world's No. 3 exporter of corn and soybeans, as well as its top supplier of soymeal livestock feed. A dramatic increase in Argentine production could put downward pressure on world food prices.
Sales of agricultural machinery, harvesters and trucks were all up, Grobocopatel said.
""The business climate in the farming sector is very enthusiastic,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell 2 percent on Wednesday after the second-biggest weekly draw in U.S. gasoline this summer was countered by an unseasonal growth in crude stockpiles.
Data showing Saudi Arabia pumping oil at record high volumes in July added to worries about a global crude glut.
U.S. crude inventories gained 1.1 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 5, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported, in a third straight week of builds that surprised the market. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 1.0 million-barrel crude draw instead. [EIA/S]
The EIA also reported that U.S. gasoline stocks fell 2.8 million barrels last week in the second-biggest weekly draw for gasoline since mid-April. The draw, coming despite U.S. East Coast refinery runs hitting 2011 lows, exceeded expectations for a gasoline stockpile drop of only 1.1 million barrels.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were down 88 cents, or 2 percent, at $41.89 per barrel by 12:48 p.m. EDT (1627 GMT). Last week, WTI fell below $40 support for the first time since April.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) slid by 80 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.18 per barrel.
""We do feel that any further strength in the spot price will be met with selling,"" said Tariq Zahir, trader in crude oil spreads at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York. ""At this time of year, we should be drawing down in crude inventories, and we are still building.""
U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) fell 3 percent, after initially gaining 1 percent on the gasoline draw data.
WTI had its sharpest monthly fall in a year in July, dropping 14 percent, after runaway gasoline demand for the summer still fell short of refiner production. Storage tanks worldwide are nearly full with oil products while refiner profits in Singapore have hit two-year lows.
The EIA added to the bearish supply-demand picture on Tuesday with a forecast that showed it had scaled back estimates for U.S. crude oil output declines in 2016. 
The outlook for oil also took a hit on Wednesday after No. 1 crude exporter Saudi Arabia told the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that the kingdom's output reached a record high of 10.67 million barrels-per-day (bpd) in July.Some remained positive on oil prices though, citing Venezuela's renewed efforts to get OPEC to cooperate with other oil producers on the market after a failed effort in April.

""The mere suggestion of OPEC working in the background on a price support initiative should be enough to hold the market in the $43-$45 levels in the near term,"" said Salvatore Recco, who helps oversee about $2 billion of client money, including in oil, at Gravity Investments in Denver.

Crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 47 cents, or 1.1%, to trade at $43.24 a barrel by 14:35GMT, or 10:35AM ET. Prices were at around $42.92 prior to the release of the inventory data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that gasoline inventories decreased by 2.8 million barrels in the week ended August 5, much more than the expected 1.0-million-barrel decline.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a surprise decline of 2.0 million barrels.
Gains were limited as the report also showed that crude oil inventories rose by 1.1 million barrels last week. Market analysts\' expected a crude-stock decline of 1.0 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply gain of 2.1 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, rose by 1.163 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 523.6 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
WTI crude futures are nearly 18% lower from their 2016 highs above $50 a barrel scaled in early June, as signs of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity added to worries about a global glut of crude.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week increased by seven to 381, the sixth consecutive weekly rise and the ninth increase in 10 weeks.
The EIA said Tuesday it expected a smaller decline of 700,000 barrels per day in U.S. crude oil production in 2016 than the 820,000 drop it forecast a month ago.
U.S. output is now expected to reach 8.31 million barrels per day in 2017, up from a previous forecast of 8.2 million barrels per day, due to the recent uptick in the number of rigs drilling for oil.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for October delivery inched up 46 cents, or 0.93%, to trade at $45.38 a barrel.
In its monthly market report published earlier, OPEC said that output from its own 14 members increased by 46,000 barrels a day to 33.11 million in July, as Saudi Arabia boosted its output to a record high.
The kingdom pumped 10.67 million barrels per day last month, a sign that OPEC's largest producer remained focused on market share rather than tackling a supply glut by curbing production.
The producer group upgraded its outlook for 2016 global oil demand growth, increasing it to 1.22 million barrels per day. For 2017, OPEC kept its forecast unchanged at 1.15 million barrels per day.
A day earlier, Brent prices lost 41 cents, or 0.9%, as market players remained skeptical that an upcoming meeting among major oil producers would result in any concrete actions to freeze output.
OPEC will hold an informal meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum conference in Algeria next month to discuss setting new limits for oil production in an effort to stabilize the market.
However, experts were skeptical that the meeting will yield any action to reduce the global glut. An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative.
London-traded Brent futures are down almost 15% since peaking at $52.80 in early June, as prospects of increased exports from Middle Eastern and North African producers, such as Iraq, Nigeria and Libya, added to concerns that a glut of oil products will cut demand for crude by refiners.

Natural gas for delivery in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange slumped to a daily low of $2.606 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since June 17.
It was last at $2.613 by 13:43GMT, or 9:43AM ET, down 0.2 cents, or 0.08%.
Market players looked ahead to weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show an increase in a range between 17 billion and 30 billion cubic feet of gas in the week ended August 5.
That compares with a surprise drop of 6 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 65 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 53 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage currently stands at 3.288 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 11.8% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 14.1% above the five-year average for this time of year.
On Tuesday, prices plunged 13.3 cents, or 4.84%, as traders reacted to milder weather and the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Natural gas futures have been under pressure in recent days amid speculation that August heat won’t prevent stockpiles from reaching a record before the winter.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange touched an intraday peak of $1,363.10 a troy ounce. It was last at $1,362.25 by 12:45GMT, or 8:45AM ET, up $15.55, or 1.15%.
A day earlier, gold tacked on $5.40, or 0.4%, after disappointing U.S. nonfarm productivity data dampened optimism over the health of the economy and reduced the prospect of an early interest rate rise from the Federal Reserve.
Fed funds futures prices showed traders now see a 39% chance of a U.S. rate hike by December, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool. That compares with around 50% at the start of the week. September odds were at around 12% early on Wednesday, down from 20% a day earlier.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell to 95.40 in early trade, moving away from levels near 96.50 just a few days ago.
Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
The yellow metal flirted with a more than two-year high above the $1,370-level less than a week ago before coming under pressure as last week's robust U.S. employment report revived speculation of a U.S. interest rate hike in the coming months.
Gold is up nearly 26% on the year so far, boosted by concerns over global growth and expectations of monetary stimulus.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for September delivery surged 59.3 cents, or 2.99%, to trade at $20.44 a troy ounce during morning hours in New York, while copper futures gained 4.7 cents, or 2.19%, to $2.197 a pound.

OPEC said that world oil demand growth this year was expected to average 1.22 million barrels per day (mb/d), 30,000 barrels higher than its previous estimate. 
The organization left its projection for 2017 unchanged at 1.15 mb/d. 
“While the OECD will contribute positively to oil demand growth adding some 0.10 mb/d, the bulk of the growth in 2017 will originate from the non-OECD with 1.05 mb/d,” the report noted.
According to the group’s expectations, demand for OPEC crude in 2016 was estimated at 31.9 mb/d, unchanged from last report and 1.9 mb/d higher than in the previous year. 
In 2017, demand for OPEC crude was forecast at 33.0 mb/d, in line with the previous report and 1.1 mb/d higher than in 2016.
Though oil prices pared gains in an initial reaction to the release, they returned to levels seen prior to the report.

Overnight, gold ticked up in quiet trade, as equities worldwide hit their highest level in almost a year dampening the precious metal's appeal as a safe-haven asset while investors engaged in a search for higher dividends amid a continuing rout in global bond yields.
Fueled by gains among Health Care and Technology stocks on Tuesday, the NASDAQ Composite index and the S&P 500 Composite index ticked higher to reach fresh all-time intraday highs.
Over the last six weeks, the NASDAQ has staged an improbable rebound driven by a 23% rally in the iShares IBB Biotechnology ETF. The S&P 500, meanwhile, has lingered in record territory throughout the summer in broad risk-on trade, while government bond yields hover near record-lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell 1 percent on Tuesday, extending losses in post-settlement trade after preliminary data showed a surprise U.S. crude stockpile build last week, heightening worries about a global petroleum glut.
The market also lost the previous day's upward momentum as speculation fizzled that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers would embark on another round of talks on price cooperation after their failed effort in April.
Trade group American Petroleum Institute (API) reported U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 2.1 million barrels during the week to Aug. 5. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 1 million-barrel drawdown instead.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will issue official inventory data on Wednesday (EIA). 
""To make a significant difference, you need a net draw of 1 or 2 million barrels across the crude, gasoline and distillates balances,"" said Phil Davis, trader at PSW Investments in Woodland Park, New Jersey.
""I think you'll see WTI going back below $40 in the next couple of weeks and fall will likely be a terrible time for oil."" 
WTI, or the West Texas Intermediate benchmark for U.S. crude (CLc1), settled down 25 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $42.77 a barrel. It fell as much as 55 cents after the release of the API data.
More than 16,500 lots of WTI put options for $40 were traded on Tuesday as traders hedged against a potential market tumble.
Brent crude (LCOc1) settled the session down 41 cents, or almost 1 percent, at $44.98 a barrel. It slid to $44.76 after the API numbers.
Just a day ago, oil prices had rallied, with WTI gaining nearly 3 percent, rebounding from last week's selloff when it fell to an April low of $39.19.
Analysts and traders have warned of a glut in both crude and refined oil products this summer, pointing particularly to the lag in U.S. gasoline demand despite the peak season for driving in the United States. OPEC's biggest producers have also been pumping near record high levels. 
In separate data issued on Tuesday, EIA said it expected a smaller decline of 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) in U.S. crude oil production in 2016 than the 820,000-bpd drop it forecast a month ago. It said an uptick in drilling will lead to more output later this year.

""The oil market remains in a battle between the trading community which focuses in the shorter term data and information which has been mostly bearish, versus the investment trading crowd which is focused on the medium-to-longer term which is projected to be bullish,"" said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York.

1030,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 09, 2016 02:58PM ET</span>","Crude retreats from 2-week highs, ahead of API inventory report","Investing.com -- Crude futures see-sawed on a choppy, volatile day of trading, retreating from two-week highs ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly crude inventory report on Tuesday evening after the close of trading.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for September delivery traded between $42.51 and $43.48 a barrel before closing at $42.66, down 0.36 or 0.84% on the session. At session-highs, the front month contract for U.S. crude hit its highest level since July 25, the last time it traded above $44 a barrel. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for October delivery wavered between $44.80 and $45.73 a barrel, before settling at $44.87, down 0.52 or 1.15% on the day.
Despite a relief-rally from 3-month lows at the start of last week, crude futures have still tumbled approximately 15% from 10-month highs in mid-June when both the U.S. and international benchmarks of crude eclipsed $50 a barrel.
Energy traders will receive a clearer picture of the supply-demand balance on U.S. markets when the API releases its latest crude stockpile on Tuesday night following close of markets. Separately, Wednesday's government report could show that crude inventories nationwide fell by 1.0 million barrels for the week ending on August 5. Over the previous week, U.S. crude stockpiles unexpectedly rose by 1.4 million barrels defying analysts' expectation for a 1.4 million draw. At 522.5 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are at historically high levels for this time of year.
Analysts will keep a close eye on Gasoline inventories, which are expected to decline by 1.2 million for the week. During the last week of July, gasoline stockpiles unexpectedly fell by 3.3 million barrels, amid a considerable drawdown throughout the PADD 1 district, covering the majority of the U.S. east coast. In recent weeks, worldwide gasoline inventories have swelled to around 500 million barrels, according to analysts from  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), as refineries churn out product at a rapid pace due to historically low crude prices.
Elsewhere, Iran exported 1.72 million barrels per day in June to China, India, Japan and South Korea, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on Tuesday, marking a 47% increase from its level in January. Last month, senior officials from Iran's state-run National Iranian Oil Company told Bloomberg that the Gulf state expects to double exports from its pre-sanction levels in an effort to regain market share, as long as demand abroad remains high.
In India, the nation consumed 48.5 million tons of oil for the three-period ending in June, representing the swiftest pace of demand growth in more than a decade. Currently, OPEC provides 85% of all oil imports to India, more than half of which is supplied by Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran, according to Clipper Data. While a number of analysts expect global markets to rebalance at some point in 2017, the return of Iran to markets in February following the removal of longstanding economic sanctions has exacerbated concerns related to the worldwide supply glut.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.20% to an intraday low of 96.02. The index is virtually flat over the last month.

1031,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 09, 2016 01:48PM ET</span>","Gold ticks up, as global stocks near 1-year high amid search for yield","Investing.com -- Gold ticked up in quiet trade, as equities worldwide hit their highest level in almost a year dampening the precious metal's appeal as a safe-haven asset while investors engaged in a search for higher dividends amid a continuing rout in global bond yields.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for December delivery traded between $1,336.10 and $1,348.45 an ounce before settling at $1,346, up 5.65 or 0.41% on the session. Although Gold has retreated from two-year highs reached in early-July, the precious metal still remains fractionally below its level on July 6 when it hit a 28-month high at $1,374.90. Since opening the year around $1,075 an ounce, Gold has soared approximately 25% year to date and is on pace for one of its strongest years in a decade.
Gold likely gained support at $1,337.50, the low from July 20 and was met with resistance at $1,391.40, the high from March 14, 2014.
Fueled by gains among Health Care and Technology stocks on Tuesday, the NASDAQ Composite index and the S&P 500 Composite index ticked higher to reach fresh all-time intraday highs. Over the last six weeks, the NASDAQ has staged an improbable rebound driven by a 23% rally in the iShares IBB Biotechnology ETF. The S&P 500, meanwhile, has lingered in record territory throughout the summer in broad risk-on trade, while government bond yields hover near record-lows.
Across the pond, the Stoxx 600 Index ticked up 0.4% while Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.62% to 6,851.30, as the U.K. initiated fresh easing measures approved by the Bank of England (BOE) last week. Consequently, the MSCI All-Country World Index jumped 0.5% to hit its highest level since last August. 
Days after the BOE cut its benchmark interest rate to a record-low of 0.25%, yields on the UK 10-Year slipped below 0.6% on Tuesday for the first time on record. While the spread between the U.S. 10-Year and 10-year U.K. Gilts remains near all-time highs, U.S. Treasuries yields are still below 1.60%, down more than 60 basis points over the last year. By comparison, the S&P 500 dividend yielded 2.04% in Tuesday's session, providing market players with an incentive to invest in equities over traditionally safer government bonds.
Meanwhile, the mounting prospects of a 2016 rate hike by the Federal Reserve continues to weigh on Gold. The CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool placed the probability of a December rate hike at approximately 50%, considerably above odds of around 30% before last week's robust U.S. jobs report. The CME Group has also increased the chances of a September rate hike to around 20%, up from 10% last week.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for Gold, which struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in periods of rising rate environments.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.20% to an intraday low of 96.02. The index is virtually flat over the last month.

1032,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 09, 2016 10:34AM ET</span>",U.S. natural gas futures fall for 4th straight session,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures fell for the fourth session in a row on Tuesday, touching a more than one-week low as forecasts for less hot weather in the days ahead dampened demand expectations for the cooling fuel.
Natural gas for delivery in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange slumped to a daily low of $2.671 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since July 28.
It was last at $2.677 by 14:30GMT, or 10:30AM ET, down 7.1 cents, or 2.58%.
On Monday, prices sank 2.4 cents, or 0.87%, as traders reacted to milder weather and the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show an increase in a range between 17 billion and 30 billion cubic feet of gas in the week ended August 5.
That compares with a surprise drop of 6 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 65 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 53 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage currently stands at 3.288 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 11.8% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 14.1% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas futures have been under pressure in recent days amid speculation that August heat won’t prevent stockpiles from reaching a record before the winter.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

The American Petroleum Institute will release its inventories report later in the day, while Wednesday’s government report could show crude stockpiles fell by 1.0 million barrels in the week ended August 5.
Gasoline inventories are expected to decline by 1.2 million barrels while stocks of distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, are forecast to rise by 375,000 barrels, according to analysts.
Crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 28 cents, or 0.65%, to trade at $43.30 a barrel by 13:37GMT, or 9:37AM ET.
On Monday, New York-traded oil futures jumped $1.22, 2.92%, as fresh hopes for an agreement among exporters to freeze production underpinned the market.
Despite recent gains, market experts warned that elevated stocks of fuel products are expected to keep prices under pressure in the near-term.
WTI crude futures are nearly 17% lower from their 2016 highs above $50 a barrel scaled in early June, as signs of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity combined with growing gasoline stockpiles weighed.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week increased by seven to 381, the sixth consecutive weekly rise and the ninth increase in 10 weeks.
The rebound in the number of rigs over the last six weeks has added to worries about a global glut of crude.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for October delivery inched up 10 cents, or 0.24%, to trade at $45.49 a barrel.
A day earlier, Brent prices rallied $1.12, or 2.53%, as sentiment was boosted amid renewed hopes for an agreement among exporters to freeze output.
According to people familiar with the matter, several OPEC members, including Venezuela, Ecuador and Kuwait, are now pushing for fresh talks on setting new limits for oil production this fall in an effort to stabilize the market.
Qatar’s Energy Minister Mohammed Bin Saleh al-Sada, who is serving as OPEC president this year, confirmed the oil cartel will hold on an informal meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum conference in Algeria scheduled to take place September 26-28.
However, market players remained skeptical that the meeting would result in any concrete actions. An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative.
Meanwhile, Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio del Pino said that a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC countries may take place ""in the coming weeks,"" however Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak currently sees no grounds for new talks on freezing production.
London-traded Brent futures are down almost 15% since peaking at $52.80 in early June, as prospects of increased exports from Middle Eastern and North African producers, such as Iraq, Nigeria and Libya, added to concerns that a glut of oil products will cut demand for crude by refiners.

Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell to a session low of $1,336.00 a troy ounce, the weakest since July 29. It was last at $1,339.35 by 12:42GMT, or 8:42AM ET, down $1.95, or 0.15%.
Nonfarm business sector labor productivity fell 0.5% in the second quarter, missing expectations for a gain of 0.4% and following a drop of 0.6% in the first quarter, the Labor Department said.
Unit labor costs increased by 2.0% in the three months ended June 30, above forecasts for a gain of 1.8%.
A day earlier, gold shed $3.10, or 0.23%, after the latest U.S. employment report bolstered expectations of faster economic growth and revived speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.
Fed funds futures prices showed traders now see a 50% of a U.S. rate hike by December, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool. That compares with around 30% as recently as last week. September odds were at around 20%, compared to less than 10% late last week.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 96.40 early Tuesday, recovering from levels below 95.00 just a week ago, amid resurgent expectations of a U.S. interest rate hike by the end of this year.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
The yellow metal flirted with a more than two-year high above the $1,370-level less than a week ago as a string of disappointing U.S. economic data prompted market players to push back expectations for the next U.S. rate hike.
For the year, the precious metal is up nearly 26%, boosted by concerns over global growth and expectations of monetary stimulus.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for September delivery shed 15.7 cents, or 0.79%, to trade at $19.64 a troy ounce during morning hours in New York, while copper futures lost 1.9 cents, or 0.88%, to $2.146 a pound.
Investors digested another round of Chinese economic data. The National Bureau of Statistics reported earlier that China’s consumer price index rose 1.8% in July from a year earlier, in line with forecasts and slowing from 1.9% in the preceding month.
The producer price index fell 1.7% on a year-over-year basis, compared to a decline of 2.6% in June, the agency said.
The soft figures confirmed there was scope for further policy easing if needed.
The Asian nation is the world’s largest copper consumer, accounting for nearly 45% of world consumption.

1036,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 09, 2016 05:20AM ET</span>",Copper is flashing a warning sign for China's economy,"Copper is waving a red flag.
""Recent movements in copper inventories highlight the lack of significant demand for the metal, particularly in the ever important Chinese market,"" analysts at BMI Research wrote in a recent note.
The country's demand matters because copper is used to make items as varied as electrical cables and coins, and China is the world's largest importer.
""While the corresponding decline in Shanghai inventories largely offset the jump in [London Metal Exchange], the shift suggests that China's strong H116 economic data does not in fact reflect improving demand growth,"" according to BMI Research.
""We expect China's refined copper imports to decelerate over the remainder of the year, and will remain wary of any other rapid movements in inventories.""
BMI noted that in June, London Metal Exchange copper inventories jumped by 70,000 metric tons in a few days. That pushed futures prices out to three months above the cash price for copper — a situation referred to as contango, which reflects an expectation that futures prices would gradually fall to match the expected spot price.
On Monday, benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange traded near a four-week low amid concerns about faltering Chinese demand.
But the level of inventories is not the only factor that influences prices, and data on them does not come easily.
""As such, despite the negative picture painted by copper inventories and growing spread, we maintain our USD 4,900/tonne forecast for 2016 and will monitor inventory trend for further signs that the market is looser than we expected,"" according to BMI Research.
Copper traded near $4,829 per metric ton on Monday, up 0.8%."

Overnight, gold inched down on Monday, amid a moderately stronger dollar, as investors continued to stake their bets on a 2016 interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve following a robust U.S. monthly jobs report at the end of last week.
As the labor market continues to rebound from a weak period in May when the U.S. economy only added 24,000 nonfarm jobs for the month, the odds of a Fed rate hike in the coming months have grown considerably following a stellar opening to the summer. Notably, hiring in the lagging construction industry picked up at a higher clip in July by 14,000 for the month, even as job gains in the mining sector remained weak. At the same time, jobs in the temporary help category rose by 17,000, providing indications that large pockets of part-time workers could be on the verge of being hired on a full-time basis. Economists also appear to be encouraged by a spike of 0.3% in average hourly wages, which are now up by 2.6% over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate stayed flat at 4.9%, while the labor force participation rate inched up by 0.1% to 62.8%.
On Monday, the CME Group's (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool placed the odds of a September rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at 18.0%, up sharply from 9% in last Thursday's session prior to the release. The probability of a December rate hike from the FOMC also increased to 40%, up from 29.4% in the middle of last week. The FOMC has held its benchmark Federal Funds Rate steady at a level between 0.25 and 0.50% at each of its first five meetings this year. Last December, the U.S. central bank halted a seven-year Zero Interest Rate Policy by approving its first rate hike in nearly a decade.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for Gold, which struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in periods of rising rate environments.

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2016 04:00PM ET</span>",Oil up nearly 3 percent on OPEC output speculation as glut grows,"By Barani Krishnan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled up nearly 3 percent on Monday amid renewed speculation that OPEC would try to restrain output, easing oversupply worries that pressured the market to three-month lows last week.
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that OPEC countries such as Venezuela, Ecuador and Kuwait want to take another stab at cooperation between the 14-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-members such as Russia.
The last such initiative failed in April after Saudi Arabia backed out of talks in Doha, Qatar, citing Iran's refusal to join in a so-called production freeze.
Qatar's Energy Minister and OPEC President Mohammad bin Saleh al-Sada hinted at overtures of cooperation in a statement on Monday. OPEC members are to have an informal meeting on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum, which groups producers and consumers, in Algeria from Sept. 26-28.
The energy minister of Russia, the world's biggest oil producer, said crude prices were not at levels that warranted intervention, but he remained open to negotiations with OPEC.
""It would appear that OPEC calls for restraint would be inevitable,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates, citing concerns over rising numbers of U.S. oil rigs and weakening energy demand.
The U.S. oil rig count rose last week for a sixth week in a row. In China, fuel exports increased more than 50 percent from a year earlier to a monthly record 4.57 million tonnes, adding to a global glut. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled up $1.22, or 2.9 percent, at $43.02 per barrel. WTI hit April lows beneath $40 a barrel last week. 
Brent crude rose $1.12, or 2.5 percent, to settle at$45.39.
Some fund managers were pessimistic the OPEC-fueled rally would last. Crude prices rallied nearly 4 percent at the session peak only to pare gains toward the close. They gave up more gains in post-settlement trade after news that the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port will have an additional 2.5 million barrels in oil capacity by April 2017.
""Until proven otherwise, this is still a correction in a bear market,"" said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive at Tuttle Tactical Management in Riverside, Connecticut.
""You can have massive up moves like this, and if you can trade it, great. But if you're looking at another run up to $50 and beyond, I'm not ready to go there. I think we still see under $35 a barrel before we get to $50.""
Hedge funds cut their bullish exposure to Brent to the smallest level since January while paring positive bets on WTI to the least since February, data on Friday showed. 

Market intelligence firm Genscape reported a build of more than 307,000 barrels at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub for WTI futures in the week to Aug. 5, traders said, even as analysts forecast a total U.S. crude inventory drop of 1 million barrels.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for September delivery traded between $41.83 and $43.38 a barrel before closing at $43.03, up 1.23 or 2.94% on the session. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for October delivery wavered between $44.25 and $45.57 a barrel, before settling at $45.38, up 1.11 or 2.51% on the day. At session-highs, the front month contract for U.S. crude surged to its highest level since July 24.
Last week, WTI crude fell as low as $39.19 a barrel, closing below $40 on August 2 for the first time since April. Brent crude also traded on Monday at its highest level since late-July, up more than 8% from last week's lows of $41.51 a barrel. Crude prices received significant pressure to the upside on Monday after Al-Sada emphasized that the global oil market remains on pace for rebalancing in spite of signals of continued volatility worldwide. Al-Sada, who also serves as the energy minister of Qatar, said Monday in a closely-watched statement that OPEC will hold an informal meeting of member countries on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum in Algeria on Sept. 26-28.
""The recent decline observed in oil prices and the current market volatility is only temporary,"" Al-Sada said in a statement. ""OPEC continues to monitor developments closely, and is in constant deliberations with all member states on ways and means to help restore stability and order to the oil market.""
The statement was released days after data indicated that hedge funds increased their short positions in WTI crude last week to the highest level in a decade. On Friday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said short positions in WTI futures and options rose to 218, 623 for the week ending on Aug. 2, the highest amount since 2006. Over the last three weeks, hedge funds have nearly doubled their short positions in WTI crude, according to the CFTC.
Last week, oil prices plunged to their lowest level since talks at a highly-anticipated meeting in Doha collapsed in mid-April. Prior to the oil summit in Qatar, U.S. crude futures surged nearly 40% from their level in mid-February on hopes of a coordinated production freeze between Russia, Saudi Arabia and two other major producers. On Feb. 11, WTI crude sank to a 13-year low at $26.05 a barrel.
Oil prices rose sharply on Monday in spite of signals of weakening demand in China. In July, China's exports plunged 4.4% in U.S. dollars while its imports plummeted 12.5% in dollar-denominated terms. China, the world's second-largest consumer of oil behind the U.S., imported roughly 7.62 million barrels in May, a four-month low.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.20% to an intraday high of 96.42. The index is still down by more than 1% since hitting four-month highs of 97.62 in late-July. Dollar-denominated commodities such as Crude become more expensive for foreign purchasers when the dollar appreciates."

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for December delivery traded between $1,335.35 and $1,343.85 an ounce before settling at $1,341.35, down 3.05 or 0.23% on the session. During last Friday's session, Gold plunged more than $20 an ounce or 1.65% after the U.S. Department of Labor said the economy added 255,000 nonfarm payrolls in July, marking the second consecutive month of dramatic gains throughout the improving labor market. Nevertheless, the precious metal is still up by more than 5% since the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union on June 24 and has jumped in value by more than 25% year to date. In early-July, Gold eclipsed $1,370 an ounce to hit a fresh 28-month high.
Gold likely gained support at $1,313.80, the low from July 25 and was met with resistance at $1,391.40, the high from March 14, 2014.
As the labor market continues to rebound from a weak period in May when the U.S. economy only added 24,000 nonfarm jobs for the month, the odds of a Fed rate hike in the coming months have grown considerably following a stellar opening to the summer. Notably, hiring in the lagging construction industry picked up at a higher clip in July by 14,000 for the month, even as job gains in the mining sector remained weak. At the same time, jobs in the temporary help category rose by 17,000, providing indications that large pockets of part-time workers could be on the verge of being hired on a full-time basis. Economists also appear to be encouraged by a spike of 0.3% in average hourly wages, which are now up by 2.6% over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate stayed flat at 4.9%, while the labor force participation rate inched up by 0.1% to 62.8%.
On Monday, the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool placed the odds of a September rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at 18.0%, up sharply from 9% in last Thursday's session prior to the release.

Dollar-denominated commodities such as Gold become more expensive for foreign purchasers when the dollar appreciates.
Elsewhere, investors kept a close eye on developments in China following the release of weaker than expected trade data on Monday. In July, China's exports plunged 4.4% in U.S. dollars while its imports plummeted 12.5% in dollar-denominated terms. The soft data could exacerbate persistent concerns related to slowing growth in the world's second-largest economy. China is the world's largest producer of Gold and the second-largest consumer of the precious metal behind India.

Natural gas for delivery in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange slumped to a daily low of $2.707 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since July 28.
It was last at $2.711 by 14:30GMT, or 10:30AM ET, down 6.1 cents, or 2.2%.
On Friday, prices sank 6.2 cents, or 2.19%, as traders reacted to milder weather and the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Natural gas futures lost 3.6% last week amid speculation that August heat won’t prevent stockpiles from reaching a record before the winter.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.288 trillion cubic feet as of last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 11.8% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 14.1% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

According to people familiar with the matter, several OPEC members, including Venezuela, Ecuador and Kuwait, are now pushing for fresh talks on setting new limits for oil production this fall in an effort to stabilize the market.
Qatar’s Energy Minister Mohammed Bin Saleh al-Sada, who is serving as OPEC president this year, said in a statement on Monday the cartel will hold on an informal meeting in Algeria on September 26-28.
However, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak currently sees no grounds for new talks on freezing production, but is open to negotiations.
An attempt to jointly freeze production levels earlier this year failed after Saudi Arabia backed out over Iran's refusal to take part of the initiative.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for October delivery rose to an intraday peak of $45.15 a barrel, the most since July 27. It was last at $45.09 by 13:40GMT, or 9:40AM ET, up 82 cents, or 1.85%.
London-traded Brent futures are down almost 15% since peaking at $52.80 in early June, as prospects of increased exports from Middle Eastern and North African producers, such as Iraq, Nigeria and Libya, added to concerns that a glut of oil products will cut demand for crude by refiners.
Elsewhere, crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 97 cents, or 2.32%, to trade at $42.77 a barrel after touching $42.77, a level not seen since July 27.
New York-traded oil shed 13 cents, or 0.31%, on Friday after a report showed the number of U.S. oil rigs rose for a sixth straight week, underlining worries about a global glut of crude.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week increased by seven to 381, the sixth consecutive weekly rise and the ninth increase in 10 weeks.
WTI crude futures are nearly 18% lower from their 2016 highs above $50 a barrel scaled in early June, as signs of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity combined with growing gasoline stockpiles weighed.
According to market experts, elevated stocks of fuel products amid slowing global demand growth is expected to keep prices under further pressure in the near-term.

Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell to a session low of $1,335.30 a troy ounce, the weakest since July 29. It was last at $1,341.25 by 12:52GMT, or 8:52AM ET, down $3.15, or 0.23%.
On Friday, gold tumbled $23.00, or 1.68%, after data showed the U.S. economy created 255,000 jobs last month, well above expectations for 180,000. June’s number was revised up to 292,000 jobs compared with the previous estimate of 287,000.
The report also showed that average hourly earnings rose month-on-month by 0.3%, beating expectations for a 0.2% gain. They were up 2.6% on the year.
The upbeat data reignited speculation that the Federal Reserve will lift interest rates this year. Fed funds futures are currently pricing in a 21% chance of a rate hike by September, compared to less than 10% late last week. December odds were at around 49%, up from 33% ahead of the report.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, surged to a one-week high of 96.50 in wake of the jobs report on Friday. It was at 96.30 early Monday.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
The yellow metal flirted with a more than two-year high above the $1,370-level less than a week ago as a string of disappointing U.S. economic data prompted market players to push back expectations for the next U.S. rate hike.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
For the year, the precious metal is up nearly 26%, boosted by concerns over global growth and expectations of monetary stimulus.
Elsewhere in metals trading, copper futures tacked on 1.9 cents, or 0.88%, to $2.173 a pound, as investors digested monthly trade data out of China.
Exports slumped 4.4% from a year earlier, worse than forecasts for a decline of 3.0%, while imports dropped 12.5%, compared to expectations for a fall of 7.0%. That left China with a surplus of $52.3 billion last month, the General Administration of Customs said.
China is the world’s largest copper consumer, accounting for nearly 45% of world consumption.

The National Oil Corporation (NOC) said it was concerned by reports of ""imminent conflict"" between the Libyan National Army (LNA) and the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) in the vicinity of Zueitina.
The PFG signed a deal late last month with Libya's U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) to reopen Zueitina and two other ports that it has been blockading.
The LNA opposes the GNA, and its chief of staff has threatened to target tankers that do not have the approval of a rival government based in eastern Libya.
""I ask both sides to withhold from actions that could damage the infrastructure, including using the facilities as a physical shield,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in a statement.
""I also ask both sides to give NOC safe passage now, before any operation commences, to move the oil in storage at the port to a safe location.""
Petroleum Facilities Guard spokesman Ali al-Hassi said his force had received threats from the LNA, and that since the announcement that the ports would reopen, groups that Hassi called ""rebel gangs"" had been targeting Zueitina in a bid to take control of oil terminals and fields.
LNA did not immediately provide a comment.

Fighting, political disputes and militant attacks have reduced Libya's oil production to a fraction of the 1.6 million barrels per day the member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was producing before the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi.

But prices still ended the week with modest gains as technical short-covering and bargain-hunting returned to support the market.
Oil futures initially jumped higher after data showed U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased more than expected in July, boosting optimism over the health of the world's largest economy.
But prices started moving lower as the upbeat jobs report lifted the U.S. dollar to one-week highs against most of its major counterparts. Oil prices typically weaken when the U.S. currency strengthens as the dollar-priced commodity becomes more expensive for holders of other currencies.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, surged to a one-week high of 96.50 in wake of the stronger-than-expected jobs report. It was at 96.19 by late Friday, up almost 0.5% for the day.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
For the week, gold slumped $13.10, or 0.96%. The yellow metal flirted with a more than two-year high above $1,370 just a few days ago as a string of disappointing U.S. economic data prompted market players to push back expectations for the next U.S. rate hike.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
For the year, the precious metal is up nearly 26%, boosted by concerns over global growth and expectations of monetary stimulus.

Crude stayed lower after oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week increased by seven to 381, the sixth consecutive weekly rise and the ninth increase in 10 weeks.
Despite Friday's modest losses, New York-traded oil futures inched up 20 cents, or 0.48%, on the week, snapping a two-week losing streak, aided by an impressive rebound that followed upbeat data on gasoline inventories.
Nymex oil prices sank to a more than three-month low below $40 a barrel earlier this week and entered a bear market before rebounding Wednesday and Thursday in the wake of a sharp drop in gasoline inventories.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, gasoline inventories decreased by 3.3 million barrels last week, much more than the expected 0.2-million-barrel decline.
However, the report also showed that crude oil inventories rose by a surprising 1.4 million barrels to 522.5 million, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
According to market experts, elevated stocks of fuel products amid slowing global demand growth is expected to keep prices under further pressure in the near-term.
WTI crude futures are nearly 19% lower from their 2016 highs above $50 a barrel scaled in early June, as signs of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity combined with growing gasoline stockpiles weighed.

London-traded Brent futures are down almost 16% since peaking at $52.80 in early June, as prospects of increased exports from Middle Eastern and North African producers, such as Iraq, Nigeria and Libya, added to concerns that a glut of oil products will cut demand for crude by refiners.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for September delivery traded between $41.06 and $42.09 a barrel before closing at $41.80, down 0.13 or 0.31% on the session. At one point this week, the front month contract for U.S. crude closed below $40 for the first time since mid-April. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for October delivery wavered between $43.52 and $44.48 a barrel, before settling at $44.27 down 0.02 or 0.05% on the day.
The international and U.S. domestic benchmarks for crude are currently down by more than 15% from their June highs.
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor said in its monthly employment report that the economy added 255,000 nonfarm payrolls in July, marking the second consecutive month that the labor market has added more than 200,000 jobs. At the same time, the labor participation rate ticked up by 0.1 to 62.8% while the unemployment rate remained flat at 4.9%. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will receive one additional monthly jobs report to judge the strength of the labor market before it meets again in late-September.
Any rate hikes by the FOMC this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.40% to an intraday high of 96.50. The index is still down by more than 1% since hitting four-month highs of 97.62 early last week. Dollar-denominated commodities such as Crude become more expensive for foreign purchasers when the dollar appreciates.
Elsewhere, oil services firm Baker Hughes said in its Weekly Rig Count report that U.S. oil rigs last week increased by seven to 381 for the week ending on July 29. It represented the sixth consecutive week of weekly increases among oil rigs nationwide. Concurrently, gas rigs fell by five to 81, while miscellaneous rigs dropped by one to two. Overall, the total rig count increased by one to 464.
Rising rig counts are viewed as a lagging indicator for increased drilling activity nationwide. As such, the latest data indicates that producers were more prone to ramp up output in June when U.S. crude surged to $50 a barrel than in the spring when oil prices were recovering from 13-year lows.
Crude futures are up sharply since falling as low as $26.05 a barrel in mid-February. Nevertheless, oil prices are still down considerably from their level two summers ago when they peaked at $115 a barrel."

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for December delivery traded between $1,342.70 and $1,370.95 an ounce before settling at $1,344.75, down 22.65 or 1.66% on the session. With the sharp declines, Gold suffered its worst one-day loss in three weeks and erased all of its gains from earlier this week. The precious metal is still up by more than 6% since the historic Brexit referendum in late-June and has increased by nearly 27% since the start of the year.
Gold likely gained support at $1,313.80, the low from July 25 and was met with resistance at $1,391.40, the high from March 14, 2014.
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor said in its monthly employment report that the economy added 255,000 nonfarm payrolls in July, topping the high end of analysts' expectations by 70,000 and erasing lingering concerns that June's robust report may have been a fluke. Adding further optimism to July's reading, the labor participation rate ticked up by 0.1 to 62.8% while the unemployment rate remained flat at 4.9%.
Within the report, the gains were driven by increases in professional & business services and temporary help, which rose by 70,000 and 17,000 respectively. Hiring in the construction and retail industries, which have lagged throughout the year, also picked up last month each adding at least 14,000. Meanwhile, employment in government and financial activities edged up, offset slightly by declines in the mining sector. Notably, average hourly wages surged by 0.3% in July and are now up by 2.6% over the last year. For the month, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by seven cents to $21.59. Analysts expected to see a 0.3% increase in average hourly earnings, one month after wages inched up by 0.1% in June.
Following the release, the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool placed the odds of a September rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at 18%, up considerably from 9% over the previous session. The chances of a December rate hike from the FOMC also increased to 39.7% on Friday, up from 29.4% a day earlier. There is also a 6.7% chance the FOMC will approve two rate hikes of 25 basis points each before the end of the year, the CME Group added.
Earlier this week, Chicago Fed president Charles Evans said it could be appropriate to raise rates once this year if economic conditions continued to improve, while Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart failed to take a September rate hike off the table. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for Gold, which struggles to compete against high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.40% to an intraday high of 96.50. The index is still down by more than 1% since hitting four-month highs of 97.62 early last week.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - As commodity markets continued dealing on Friday, traders were lamenting the imminent demise of the version of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) Messenger that has been their main communication tool since the late 1990s.
The software was still operating and in use during London trading hours, even though  Yahoo Inc  had set Aug. 5 as the date for shutting down the standalone version of Messenger which many oil industry users are reluctant to give up.
""You have no idea how much I'll miss Yahoo Messenger,"" said a senior oil trader in Singapore who has been in the business for 20 years.
""I built up hundreds of contacts on it over more than a decade. I have Yahoo friends I have never met, but with whom I spent many hours bantering and joking. It also made me a lot of money. Now that it's gone, I could cry."" 
With Messenger's end, the oil industry has to deal with a fragmented communication market, which some say will force players back to the telephone.
""Yahoo was great as an aggregator for all commodity participants so I think any cross-broking from one messenger platform may mean people use the old friend – the phone,"" said Matt Stanley, a fuel oil broker at Freight Investor Services in Dubai.
""So in some kind of ironic way, you may see stronger relationships formed now people have to interact the old-school way,"" he added.
FRAGMENTATION 
Yahoo, which in July announced the sale of its core business unit to  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ), took the oil industry by storm in the late 1990s.
Its free instant messaging technology revolutionized the industry, helping usher in a new era of high-speed communication that changed the way millions of barrels of oil traded daily.
""It was useful to exchange some information really quickly, without having to spend 15 minutes on the phone,"" Olivier Jakob, managing director at PetroMatrix in Zug, Switzerland, said of Yahoo. 
But the online, follow-up version to Yahoo's standalone messaging software cannot be used by the industry. It fails to meet compliance standards because conversations cannot be saved locally.
As a result, oil traders, brokers, analysts and also reporters covering the oil industry have been scrambling for alternatives, of which there are plenty.
They include ICE's Instant Messaging; Symphony, in which 18 of the world's biggest financial institutions hold stakes; Bloomberg Messenger; Thomson Reuters' Eikon Messenger; Twitter; and Facebook's WhatsApp.
""It's difficult to say if there is one consensus move to another platform,"" Jakob said. ""It will take time."" 
The inevitable fragmentation of the market is seen as a nuisance by most.
""Let's face it, it's not the end of the world. But Yahoo's beauty was that everybody used one platform,"" said one Asian fuel broker.

""Now, we all use several platforms, and that's a bit of a pain.""

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for December delivery were up 0.23% at $1,370.55.
The December contract ended Thursday’s session 0.20% higher at $1,367.40 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,347.00, Thursday’s low and resistance at $1,374.90, the high from July 6.
Gold prices moved higher after the Bank of England delivered its first rate cut in seven years on Thursday and announced more measures to stimulate the economy in a bid to ward off recession following Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union.
The BoE cut interest rates to a record-low 0.25% in a bid to buffer the economy from a downturn following the Brexit vote.
The central bank also boosted its quantitative easing program by £60 billion and slashed its growth forecast for next year. It now expects growth of just 0.8% in 2017, down from 2.3% in its May forecasts.
Almost all economists had expected the BoE to cut rates and many also expected it to resume its multi-billion-pound program of government bond purchases.
The precious metal was also supported by a weaker dollar following Thursday’s mixed U.S. data.
Sentiment on the greenback remained vulnerable after the U.S. Census Bureau said that factory orders decreased by 1.5% in June, better than forecasts for a decline of 1.8%.
The report came after the Labor Department said initial jobless claims increased by 3,000 to 269,000 from the previous week’s total of 266,000. Analysts expected jobless claims to decline by 1,000 to 265,000 last week.
Market participants were now looking ahead to the highly-anticipated U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, due later Friday, for further indications on the strength of the job market.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.13% at 95.63.
Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose nearly 3 percent on Thursday, with U.S. crude advancing firmly above the $40-per-barrel mark on short-covering and after a modest stockpile drop at the delivery hub for U.S. crude futures.
It was a second straight day of gains for crude futures from April lows below $40, after Wednesday's 3 percent run-up powered by data showing a hefty U.S. gasoline inventory drawdown.
Market intelligence firm Genscape reported that stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub for U.S. crude futures fell 89,071 barrels during the week to Aug. 2, traders who saw the data said. The Genscape report came after U.S. government data on Wednesday showed a 1.1 million-barrel decline at Cushing in the week to July 29.
Sources said  BP  PLC (L:BP) was restarting units at its 413,500-barrel per day refinery in Whiting, Indiana, and that added momentum to the crude rally, according to traders. The weekend outage of the reformer and blending oil unit had prompted BP to cut production by between 20 and 25 percent.
Brent crude (LCOc1) settled up $1.19, or 2.8 percent, at $44.29 a barrel.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) rose $1.10, or 2.7 percent, to settle at $41.93 per barrel. In the previous session, it rose 3 percent, after settling below $40 on Tuesday, the first time since April.
""We're sitting pretty, with our customers extremely happy at having profited from WTI option hedges at under $40, and are now long again for $45-$55 levels,"" said Salvatore Recco, who advises on some $2 billion of client money at Gravity Investments in Denver, Colorado.
Before the slump below $40, speculators, including hedge funds, added the equivalent of 56 million barrels of extra short positions in the three main Brent and WTI futures and options contracts in the week ending July 26. 
U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1), however, ended up only 1.3 percent higher on Thursday, with the gasoline crack <1RBc1-CLc1>, an indicator of refining profits, falling for the first time in six sessions.
WTI's drop below $40 earlier this week had hardened the resolve of oil market bears to drive prices lower as oversupply, refining cutbacks and a breakdown in the oil/dollar trade appeared to spell an end to this year's rally. 
Data from Iraq's state oil marketer showed the OPEC member's July crude production at its highest since January at 4.6 million barrels per day.
Stockpiles of middle distillates in Singapore were at a five-year high year, adding to worries of a worldwide petroleum glut.
The Cushing draw aside, total U.S. crude stocks rose for a second straight week, gaining 1.4 million barrels last week, contrary to analysts' forecasts for an identical draw. 

""Our long standing WTI-Brent targets of $37-38 remain as high probability and position type shorts represent a hold,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for September delivery traded between $40.45 and $42.08 a barrel before closing at $41.84, up 1.01 or 2.47% on the session. Earlier this week, the front month contract for U.S. crude futures closed below $40 for the first time since mid-April, capping a lengthy five-week downturn after hitting 10-month highs at the start of the summer. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for October delivery wavered between $42.52 and $44.33 a barrel, before settling at $44.23, up 1.12 or 2.60% on the day.
The international and U.S. domestic benchmarks for crude are still down more than 15% from their June highs.
In Thursday's session, market players continued to digest a surprising draw in gasoline inventories last week when stockpiles nationwide fell by 3.3 million barrels for the week ending on July 29. It came amid mounting fears among analysts of a massive supply glut in recent weeks, as refineries churn out product at a rapid pace due to comparatively low oil prices. In spite of the massive decline, total petroleum inventories have still spiked by approximately 25 million barrels over the last two months, according to analysts.
Investors turn their attention to Friday's weekly rig count from Baker Hughes  for clearer indications on the rate of drilling activity throughout the U.S. Last week, Baker Hughes reported that the U.S. oil rig count rose by three to 374 for the week ending on July 22, representing the fifth consecutive week of weekly gains.
High cost U.S. shale producers have seen their global market share wane, as prices remain sharply below their peak of $115 a barrel from two summers ago. In November, 2014, OPEC rattled global energy markets by maintaining their production ceiling above 30 million barrels per day in an effort to regain market share. The strategy triggered a prolonged battle between leading producers in the Middle East and the U.S. for control of oil markets worldwide, creating an imbalance between global supply and demand.
Analysts from the Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimated this week that OPEC could control as much as 46% of global supply by 2020, nearly matching its peak from forty years ago. At the same time, the IIF predicts that global oil demand will increase by 1.4 million bpd in 2016, before rising by another 1.3 million bpd by the end of next year. As a steady increase in demand is met by only a moderate increase in global supply, the IIF estimates that oil prices will remain in a range between $40 and $50 a barrel through the end of 2017.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.20% to an intraday high 95.87. The index is still sharply below four-month highs of 97.62 from early last week.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for December delivery traded between $1,355.25 and $1,371.35 an ounce before settling at $1,367.05, up 2.35 or 0.17% on the session. With the slight gains, Gold closed higher for the seventh time over the last eight sessions. Since opening the year near $1,075 an ounce, Gold has soared approximately 29% over the last six months and is on pace for one of its strongest years in a decade.
Gold likely gained support at $1,337.50, the low from July 20 and was met with resistance at $1,391.40, the high from March 14, 2014.
On Thursday morning, the Bank of England as expected lowered its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a record-low of 0.25%, representing its first interest rate cut in seven years. Notably, the BOE increased its asset purchasing by £60 billion, outlined a plan to begin buying £10 billion of corporate bonds per month and announced an initiative for providing as much as £100 billion to banks under a comprehensive term funding scheme.
""We have launched a timely, coherent and comprehensive package,"" BOE governor Mark Carney said.
At the same time, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) increased its near-term inflation outlook on Thursday, due primarily to the recent depreciation of the Pound Sterling. By year's end, the MPC expects inflation to reach 0.8%, up from previous estimates of 0.4%. The MPC also anticipates that inflation will increase to 1.9% by the end of 2017 and overshoot its 2% target in December, 2018. Carney emphasized that additional rate cuts and further easing measures could be forthcoming if the figures in Thursday's inflation forecast wind up being accurate. GBP/USD plummeted more than 1.5% in response to the rate decision, falling to an intraday low of 1.3112. The Pound has plunged nearly 12% against the Dollar since U.K. voters decided to leave the European Union in a historic referendum on June 24.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained more than 0.20% to an intraday high of 95.87. The index is still sharply below four-month highs of 97.62 from early last week. Dollar-denominated commodities such as Gold become more expensive for foreign purchasers when the dollar appreciates.
Investors turn their attention to Friday's U.S. monthly jobs report for the month of July for further indications on the strength of the labor market. Analysts expect to see an increase of 185,000 in nonfarm payrolls, one month after the economy added a robust 287,000 jobs in June. Steady increases in wages and continued declines in unemployment over the next two months could compel the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates at its next meeting in September.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for gold, which struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in periods of rising rate environments.
Silver for September delivery fell 0.039 or 0.19% to 20.432 an ounce.
Copper for September delivery lost 0.025 or 1.11% to 2.175 a pound."

Natural gas for delivery in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 2.5 cents, or 0.88%, to trade at $2.864 per million British thermal units by 14:33GMT, or 10:33AM ET. Prices were at around $2.837prior to the release of the supply data.
A day earlier, prices surged 10.6 cents, or 3.88%, as traders placed wagers that this week's storage data would be on the bullish side.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended July 29 declined by 6 billion cubic feet, compared to forecasts for an increase of 2 billion.
That compared with a build of 17 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 41 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 54 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.288 trillion cubic feet, 11.8% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 14.1% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, updated weather forecasting models pointed to mostly mild weather across most parts of the U.S. in the coming days, underlining the view that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

U.S. crude was at $40.50 a barrel during morning hours in New York on Thursday, close to four-month lows of $39.19 hit earlier this week.
U.S. oil futures are nearly 20% lower from their 2016 highs above $50 a barrel scaled in early June, technically placing it in bear market territory, as signs of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity combined with growing gasoline stocks weighed.
Meanwhile, Brent traded at $42.60, after falling to a more than three-month low of $41.51 on Tuesday.
London-traded Brent futures are down almost 21% since peaking at $52.80 in early June, as prospects of increased exports from Middle Eastern and North African producers, such as Iraq, Nigeria and Libya, added to concerns that a glut of oil products will cut demand for crude by refiners.
According to market experts, elevated stocks of fuel products amid slowing global demand growth is expected to keep prices under further pressure in the near-term.

Crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped 13 cents, or 0.32%, to trade at $40.70 a barrel by 13:34GMT, or 9:34AM ET.
A day earlier, New York-traded oil jumped $1.32, or 3.34%, after data showed that gasoline supplies in the U.S. fell sharply last week, offsetting a surprise build in crude stockpiles.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that gasoline inventories decreased by 3.3 million barrels in the week ended July 29, much more than the expected 0.2-million-barrel decline.
The report also showed that crude oil inventories rose by a surprising 1.4 million barrels last week to 522.5 million, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
Despite Wednesday's gains U.S. oil prices remain near four-month lows of $39.19 hit earlier this week.

The BoE voted unanimously to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a record-low 0.25%, as widely expected.
The central bank also raised the amount of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves to £435 billion from £375 billion. The Monetary Policy Committee will buy £60 billion of government bonds over six months and as much as £10 billion pounds of corporate bonds in the next 18 months.
Prices received an additional boost after data showed that the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week rose unexpectedly to 269,000.
Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on $6.05, or 0.44% to trade at $1,370.75 a troy ounce by 12:49GMT, or 8:49AM ET, after being down by as much as 0.7% at a session low of $1,355.10 earlier.
Investors now looked ahead to Friday's key U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for July to gauge the health of the world's largest economy and whether it is strong enough to warrant an interest rate hike in the coming months.
The consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 175,000, following an increase of 287,000 in June, the unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 4.9%, while average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.2% after gaining 0.1% a month earlier.
An upbeat employment report will point to an improving economy and support the case for higher interest rates in the months ahead, while a weak report would add to uncertainty over the economic outlook and push prospects of tighter monetary policy further off the table.
Fed funds futures are currently pricing in just a 12% chance of a rate hike by September. December odds were at around 40%, compared to 53% at the start of last week.
The yellow metal has been well supported in recent sessions as a string of disappointing U.S. economic reports prompted market players to push back expectations for the next U.S. rate hike.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
For the year, the precious metal is up nearly 28%, boosted by concerns over global growth and expectations of monetary stimulus.

1075,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 04, 2016 03:40AM ET</span>",'A perfect storm' is making gold one of the hottest assets on the planet,"""A perfect storm"" in markets has left investors scrambling to add gold to their portfolios for protection, according to the World Gold Council.
Investors have another prime and relatively safe choice in the government bonds of developed markets, but that has been compromised by ""unconventional monetary policy,"" the council said in its  market update for August.
The yields on developed-market government bonds have trended lower as demand has risen.
Sovereign authorities like the European Central Bank are stoking this demand through their bond purchases, which are pushing down yields.
As bond prices rise, their yields fall. And this policy approach by central banks has left investors questioning its effectiveness as they scramble for better yield elsewhere, like in gold.
Gold prices have surged 27% this year, outperforming many other commodities and the S&P 500.
The council used the Bank of Japan's weak bond auction as an example of what it believes investors think of central banks.
On Tuesday, a Japanese 10-year bond auction drew the weakest demand in five months. That was after Japan announced a  stimulus package worth over 28 trillion yen — $275 billion — but smaller than markets had expected.
The World Gold Council, which sponsors the SPDR Gold Trust, one of the largest exchange-traded funds in the world that is backed by gold, argued:
""Many analysts are interpreting weak Japanese Government Bond demand as a signal that investors are starting to lose confidence in the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policies, following increasingly desperate bids by the world's central banks to reflate the global economy. In this environment, we believe investors are using gold to hedge portfolio risk as they add more stocks.""
The WGC said that as central banks add more bonds to their balance sheets, they are limiting the amount that's available to investors.
""In reality, we estimate that less than 40% of DM sovereign bonds (US$10 trillion) have a positive yield and are 'available' to investors, while only 17% (US$4.4 trillion) is yielding more than 1%,"" the council said.
""In our view, lower opportunity costs and a more limited set of investable assets has, in turn, notably increased the lure of gold,"" it said."

A Reuters poll of economists published last week predicted the British central bank would cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25% from 0.50%, but most said it would not revive its massive bond-buying program for now.

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2016 01:10AM ET</span>","As U.S. crude wobbles near $40, new oil rally in doubt","By Barani Krishnan
(Reuters) - U.S. crude's slide below $40 a barrel this week has hardened the resolve of oil market bears to drive prices lower, with oversupply, refining cutbacks and a breakdown in the oil/dollar trade spelling an end to this year's rally.
Few believe oil will revisit the 12-year lows of $26 to $27 a barrel seen in the first quarter, but many are zeroing in on $35 a barrel or lower for U.S. crude. Short bets have increased in recent weeks as investors believe the spring rally that nearly doubled the price of oil took the market too far, too fast. 
""The bandwagon trade just two months ago was that we will hit $60, but now $35 is looking like more of a reality,"" said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.
""We're in a vicious cycle, with no sign of this glut in oil products disappearing anytime soon, while any cutback by refiners is backing up crude into the system. This tells me the rally is over,"" said Kilduff. He said he was using mostly options and futures positions to bet on $35 oil. 
Crude inventories jumped by 1.4 million barrels in the most recent week, surprising forecasters who expected an identical draw. The build brought stockpiles, minus the U.S. strategic reserve, to an all-time seasonal high of 522.5 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Department.
OPEC oil producers are pumping near record high levels while top crude exporter Saudi Arabia cut prices for its Asian customers at the weekend, signaling another price war and tussle for crude market share.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled below $40 on Tuesday for the first time since April. It ended Wednesday at $40.83 a barrel.
Tariq Zahir, an oil bear who trades mostly in timespreads of WTI, is betting the spot U.S. price will not hold above $40 for long.
""I'm selling into this rally,"" Zahir, who heads Tyche Capital Advisors in New York, said Wednesday. Having frequently made money this year betting nearer-dated oil contracts will weaken against farther-dated deliveries, Zahir was also emboldened by short bets that have built up lately against WTI.
Speculators, including hedge funds, have turned increasingly bearish toward crude and refined products in the last two months, adding the equivalent of 56 million barrels of extra short positions in the three main Brent and WTI futures and options contracts in the week ending July 26.
Oil's recent tumble came amid a breakdown in its correlation with the dollar (DXY). When the dollar falls, oil usually rises. That did not happen earlier this week when the U.S. currency fell to six-week lows. Some saw that as a bearish sign.
Yet others expect stronger oil prices. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday maintained its 2017 target for oil at $52.50. The bank noted that most of the sell-off has been the result of declines in far-dated contracts, suggesting a ""repricing of long-term potential supply,"" rather than a reassessment of current conditions. 

French bank  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) said in a note on Tuesday that compared to the first quarter of the year, when global stocks were rising, now, ""global supply and demand are roughly balanced, in large part due to steadily declining U.S. crude production.""

1078,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2016 01:05AM ET</span>","China money, market spur Canadian blueberry deluge","By Julie Gordon
RICHMOND, British Columbia, August 4 (Reuters) - An aging mansion sits vacant on an estate outside Vancouver, the garage overtaken by a blueberry sorter and a walk-in cooler packed with the fruit.
The owner, an investor from mainland China, leases the estate to Fred Liu at such a bargain the farmer grows blueberries in its fields even though the bottom has fallen out of the market.
As it turns out, the same wave of Chinese wealth that has fueled real estate booms in cities like New York, Sydney and San Francisco and stoked the art market worldwide also has contributed to an unexpected glut of blueberries.
Chinese investors riding a hot property market along the Pacific Coast have socked millions into a belt of protected farmland around Vancouver, long a destination for Asian immigrants, and many have taken advantage of Canadian agricultural tax breaks, agents and farmers said.
Because much of the land is restricted to farming, rents have remained stubbornly low. Veteran farmers and entrepreneurial newcomers have snapped up the cheap leases, eager to cash in on the blueberry's ascent as a super food and the promise that a trade deal with China would open the world’s second-largest economy to fresh Canadian exports.
But demand has yet to meet bullish projections. Delayed trade negotiations and a surge in global blueberry production have prevented China's rising middle class from eating enough of the British Columbia bumper crop that Chinese investors helped sow.
The result: a bubble for Vancouver area farmland and a bust for berries.
Prices for rural property near Vancouver have surged – hitting, in one recent deal, 230 times the per-acre average for Canadian farmland. And blueberry prices have collapsed, dropping to less than C$1 per pound at peak season, half what some growers said they were getting a few years ago.
Norm Letnick, British Columbia’s agriculture minister, said he doesn't see it as a glut, and he downplayed the sharp price drop at packing houses.
Growers may be doing better at roadside stands, he said. ""Because they don't have a middle man, they might be making very good net profit.""
For many farmers, that view misses the bigger picture.
""Rich people, they can buy the farms, but they don't want to do the farming,"" said Liu, who grows organic berries for export to Asia. ""It's very, very, very cheap to lease their farmland.""
But, he said, ""farmers are not getting rich.""
A LAND RUSH
About half the listings in recent years for smaller farms and nearly all the larger ones near Vancouver have been purchased by buyers with ties to mainland China, agents said.
Canada doesn’t track the nationality of property owners, and British Columbia only began doing so in June. It reported 18 percent of sales in recent weeks in Richmond, home to one of the most well-established Chinese communities in Canada, were to unspecified foreign nationals living abroad. Chinese nationals with resident status in Canada were excluded.
The buying spree has set records. A 4.5 acre blueberry farm with no house sold late last year to a Chinese investor for C$2.58 million ($1.97 million), or C$573,000 per acre. Nationwide, farmland averages C$2,460 per acre, according to Farm Credit Canada.
The British Columbia Blueberry Council, a trade group representing hundreds of growers, said much of the interest was from Chinese business people who see berry farms as an export opportunity, much like those who have bought vineyards in recent years to export British Columbia wine to China.
Real estate agents said some Chinese nationals were looking at the redevelopment potential, viewing farms as lottery tickets that would pay out if urban sprawl one day forces officials to scrap strict prohibitions.
""They're playing the long game,"" said agent Michael Lu.
Others have built luxurious estate homes with an eye toward retirement and surrounded them with berries.
TAX BREAKS
Owners cut their taxes by using the land for farming, often leasing it out to local growers. Owners like blueberries because they are pretty and easy to maintain, especially compared to the province’s No. 2 produce export – mushrooms.
Discounts vary by municipality, but, across the province, farmland is taxed at lower rates, so long as it earns at least C$2,500 a year from crops.
In Richmond, for example, a 4-acre farm with a basic house paid taxes of C$1,025 per year, according to a 2014 Metro Vancouver study. The same plot, without farm classification, would pay C$10,511 annually.
""If it's not farmed, the taxes are going to be high,"" said Dale Badh, a real estate agent and berry farmer.
British Columbia growers also are playing a long game – but not by design. The province produces 80 percent by value of fresh blueberries exported by Canada, the world’s No. 2 producer.
Like farmers elsewhere, they went big into blueberries, encouraged that the touted health benefits would stoke the market.
They also were banking on trade talks with China. A China cherry deal, finalized in 2014, boosted export values 70 percent in one year.
Newcomers have leased plots from absentee landlords because they can't afford to buy their own, and long-established farm families have rented additional plots because they are cheap.
Together, they pushed British Columbia’s blueberry yields up 71 percent from 2010 to 2015.
But the trade talks dragged on for nearly a decade. A deal, finally reached late last year, is expected to boost the province’s fresh exports to China up from C$24,466 in 2015 to C$65 million - eventually.
In the meantime, British Columbia's blueberry growers are doing what they can to hang on. Farmer and packer Humraj Kallu has stopped buying from other growers because it's all he can do to sell what he produces.
""I'm dealing in only my berries,"" he said, adding: ""Farming is not the most viable thing in B.C.""

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for September delivery traded between $39.33 and $41.03 a barrel before closing at $40.80, up 1.29 or 3.26% on the session. It came one day after WTI closed below $40 for the first time since mid-April when crude futures took a hit following the collapse of a closely watched Doha Agreement among major producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for October delivery wavered between $41.58 and $43.28 a barrel, before settling at $43.03, up 1.22 or 2.92% on the day.
Since hitting 2016 yearly highs of $51 a barrel in early-June, U.S. crude futures have slumped by nearly 20% over the last several weeks.
On Wednesday morning, U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report that Gasoline Inventories declined by 3.3 million barrels for the week ending on July 29, considerably more than analysts' expectations for a modest 0.2 million draw. Of the declines, stocks in the PADD 1 district covering the majority of the East Coast, fell by 1.2 million barrels for the week. The PADD 1 district, which has been beset by rising stockpiles in recent weeks, has still seen gasoline inventories soar by 11.5 million barrels over the last year.
The drawdown could help assuage some fears of long-term oversupply among gasoline inventories worldwide. According to analysts from  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), gasoline inventories have soared to a near-record high of 500 million barrels throughout the world, as refineries churn out product at a rapid pace amid low crude prices. Despite last week's draw, total petroleum inventories have spiked by approximately 25 million over the last nine weeks, according to Ion Energy Group analyst Kyle Cooper.
Overall, U.S. commercial crude inventories increased by 1.4 million barrels for the period in comparison with the week ending on July 22. At 522.5 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are at historically high levels for this time of year. Analysts expected to see a decline of 1.4 million barrels, one day after the American Petroleum Institute reported a draw of 1.3 million barrels. At the Cushing Oil Hub in Oklahoma, inventories fell by 1.12 million barrels on the week. Cushing, the main delivery point for NYMEX oil, is the largest crude storage facility in the U.S.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose by more than 0.40% to an intraday high 95.35, bouncing off five-week lows. On Tuesday the index slipped below 95 for the first time since June 24. Before Wednesday's rebound, the Dollar had fallen sharply since hitting four-month highs at 97.62 early last week.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for December delivery traded between $1,360.65 and $1,373.20 an ounce before settling at $1,364.25, down 8.45 or 0.62% on the session. With the slight declines, Gold halted a six-day winning streak over the last week. Since opening the year near $1,075 an ounce, Gold has soared more than 28% over the last six months and is on pace for one of its strongest years in a decade.
Gold likely gained support at $1,337.50, the low from July 20 and was met with resistance at $1,391.40, the high from March 14, 2014.
On Thursday morning, the Bank of England is largely expected to slash its benchmark interest rate to a record-low of 0.25%, following a string of soft economic data in the weeks since June's historic Brexit decision. When voters in the U.K. approved a referendum paving the way for Britain's departure from the European Union on June 24, BOE governor Mark Carney sent strong hints that the bank could reduce rates and introduce further easing measures at some point over the summer in order to help avert a significant economic downturn. Historically, interest rate cuts from the BOE have been associated with a sharp depreciation in the Pound. Over the last six weeks, GBP/USD has tumbled more than 10% following the surprising Brexit move.
Following the Bank of England's rate decision, market players will turn their attention to a closely-watched U.S. employment report for the month of July on Friday for a clearer picture on the state of the U.S. labor market. Ahead of the report, payroll solutions firm ADP said in its monthly National Employment report that the economy added 179,000 nonfarm payroll positions in July, above consensus estimates of 165,000. On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president Dennis Lockhart said he will closely watch the next two monthly employment reports before the Fed meets again in September. In addition, Chicago Fed president Charles Evans told reporters on Wednesday afternoon that one rate hike this year could be appropriate if inflation continues to move closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for gold, which struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in periods of rising rate environments.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped about 2 percent on Wednesday, with U.S. crude futures returning above $40 a barrel, after the U.S. government reported a larger-than-expected gasoline drawdown that offset a surprise build in crude stockpiles.
U.S. crude inventories rose 1.4 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 1.4 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration reported. [EIA/S]
Gasoline stocks slumped by 3.3 million barrels, compared with forecasts for a 200,000-barrel drop.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) was up 70 cents at $40.21 a barrel by 10:55 a.m. EDT (1555 GMT). On Tuesday, it settled below $40 a barrel the first time since April.
Brent crude (LCOc1) rose 62 cents to $42.42. It hit a more than three-month low of $41.51 in the previous day.
""With spot prices getting under $40 yesterday, we are not surprised to see spot prices rebounding on the gasoline draw. But I think this will be shortlived,"" said Tariq Zahir, trader in crude oil spreads at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.

""The bottom line is the Street in the second quarter got a little ahead of itself in calling for rebalancing of supply-demand after Canadian and Nigerian supply disruptions. We are going into the third and fourth quarters with those supplies back online and refinery maintenance coming up.""

Crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 72 cents, or 1.8% to trade at $40.23 a barrel by 14:38GMT, or 10:38AM ET. Prices were at around $40.05 prior to the release of the inventory data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that gasoline inventories decreased by 3.3 million barrels in the week ended July 29, much more than the expected 0.2-million-barrel decline.
The report also showed that crude oil inventories rose by 1.4 million barrels last week. Market analysts' expected a crude-stock decline of 1.4 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply drop of 1.3 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, fell by 1.12 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 522.5 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported an increase of 1.2 million barrels.
On Tuesday, New York-traded oil sank to a more than three-month low of $39.26. WTI crude futures are nearly 23% lower from their 2016 highs above $50 a barrel scaled in early June, technically placing it in bear market territory, as signs of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity combined with elevated stocks of fuel products weighed.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for October delivery tacked on 68 cents, or 1.63%, to $42.48 a barrel, after falling to a more than three-month low of $41.51 on Tuesday.
London-traded Brent futures are down almost 21% since peaking at $52.80 in early June, as prospects of increased exports from Middle Eastern and North African producers, such as Iraq, Nigeria and Libya, added to concerns that a glut of oil products will cut demand for crude by refiners.

Natural gas for delivery in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 7.7 cents, or 2.82%, to trade at $2.810 per million British thermal units by 13:38GMT, or 9:38AM ET.
Sentiment was boosted amid speculation this week's storage report will show the smallest build for the week ended July 29 since at least 2010.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration's storage report slated for release on Thursday is expected to show a build of approximately 10 billion cubic feet, as a recent heat wave prompted households to ramp up their air conditioning.
That compares with a build of 17 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 41 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 54 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.294 trillion cubic feet, 13.2% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 15.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
A day earlier, prices lost 3.8 cents, or 1.37%, as traders reacted to milder weather and the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

1088,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2016 01:20AM ET</span>",Big investors pare energy junk bond holdings after big rally,"By Devika Krishna Kumar and Jennifer Ablan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors in junk-rated energy bonds, who have made a mint this year betting on this battered sector, are paring their holdings as oil flirts with sub-$40-a-barrel levels on concerns about a persistent overhang in supply and choppy demand.
Thanks to the two-year slump in the price of oil, energy debt securities yielded a whopping 21 percent in February when crude hit its lowest in over a decade at about $26. That brought in opportunistic buyers who watched prices rise, pushing yields to around 9.5 percent now, a level that these investors see as overvalued relative to oil's weakening price. 
Energy debt prices have managed to continue to rally even as the price of oil headed lower in July, as investors believed that the bankruptcies that resulted from the two-year slump were largely behind the market. 
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) settled on Tuesday below $40 for the first time since April, on heightened worries of a crude glut despite peak summer fuel demand. Oil lost nearly 15 percent in July, the biggest monthly loss in a year, triggering liquidation among bond investors. 
Other bond investors who benefited from the recent risk-on rally in energy debt are paring holdings, viewing the massive run-up as an opportunity to take profits.
""We're neutral on energy bonds,"" said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at bond giant Pacific Investment Management Co, which oversees $1.5 trillion in assets. He said the firm is ""cautious after their huge run,"" having moved to an underweight position in their high-yield holdings.
The BofA Merrill Lynch (BAML) U.S. High Yield Energy Index <.MERH0EN> posted a return of 26.7 percent from the start of the year through mid-July. Since then, though, the index is slipping, having dropped for 11 days straight, shedding about 3 percent in that period.
About 50 percent of the weight of this index is in double-B bonds, the highest-rated of junk debt. Those spreads are at 4.82 percentage points above comparable Treasury debt, yielding about 6 percent.
While still junk-rated, these securities reflect the lowest probabilities of default. Given that oil has dropped more than 20 percent from its June 9 peak, investors are finding it difficult to argue for real value for those bonds. 
""You obviously regret the performance you missed, but a lot of these names are struggling and will continue to struggle,"" said Gregory Peters, senior investment officer at  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Fixed Income with more than $621 billion of assets. Prudential has some energy names but well under the index amount.
The BAML high-yield strategy team recommends a modestly overweight positioning in energy and within the sector, have an overweight target for exploration and production companies. 
S&P Global Ratings in May said it expects corporate defaults to keep rising, dominated by energy companies. Between the start of 2015 and March 2016, the energy sector accounted for half of all corporate debt defaults in the United States. 
Given expectations for continued low prices for oil and natural gas in 2016, this sector is expected by S&P Global Ratings to continue to dominate the default total, with the high likelihood of its proportion growing throughout the year.
One factor that has kept some investors positive on high-yield bonds is the notion that the current slump is not fully reflective of the fundamentals of oil.
While crude prices have been pressured by resurgent output and a glut in refined products, some analysts believe global supply and demand are roughly balanced, driven by steady declines in U.S. production.
Daniel Loeb's $16 billion Third Point LLC said that the bottom in oil was earlier this year. Last week, Third Point said its investments in energy credits drove positive returns during the first half of the year and it is devoting over $1 billion to energy corporate credits. 
Third Point said it is currently focused on debt of ""companies with high-quality assets and deleveraging catalysts where we can make good returns while limiting downside risk should commodity prices stagnate.""
 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) oil analyst Michael Wittner said he expects crude prices to bottom out in the high $30 range. 

""We do not think that we will return to $35 or $30 or $26-27, as we saw in Q1 16,"" he said in a note.

On Tuesday morning, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose by 0.1% in June, slightly below consensus estimates of a 0.2% increase following a gain of 0.2% over the previous month. The gains are reflected by an uptick in spending for gas, electricity and healthcare services, which were partially offset by a reduction in spending in new vehicles. Over the last 12 months, the PCE Price Index has increased by 0.9% -- remaining unchanged from the year-over-year gains exhibited in May.
The Core PCE Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, inched up by 0.1% in June, in line with consensus estimates and below May's 0.2% monthly increase. On an annual basis, Core personal consumption expenditures are up by 1.6%, unchanged from May's level. At last week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) July monetary policy meeting, the Committee said market-based measures of inflation continue to remain low, as the Core PCE index hovers below its long-term targeted objective of 2%.
While delivering a speech on monetary policy and the global economy in Beijing, Dallas Fed president Rob Kaplan urged the U.S. central bank to raise rates in a ""gradual and patient manner,"" amid continuing challenges facing the U.S. economy. A day earlier, Kaplan told Bloomberg in a televised interview that a September rate hike is still on the table. Last week, the FOMC left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a level between 0.25 and 0.50% for a fifth consecutive meeting.
Any rate hikes this year are viewed as bearish for gold, which struggles to compete versus high-yield bearing assets in periods of rising rate environments.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for December delivery traded between $1,353.80 and $1,374.15 an ounce before settling at $1,372.25, up $12.65 or 0.93% on the session. Gold has now closed higher in six consecutive sessions. Since opening the year around $1,075 an ounce, Gold has soared approximately 30% year to date and is on pace for one of its strongest years in a decade.
Gold likely gained support at $1,337.50, the low from July 20 and was met with resistance at $1,391.40, the high from March 14, 2014.
On Tuesday morning, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose by 0.1% in June, slightly below consensus estimates of a 0.2% increase following a gain of 0.2% over the previous month. The gains are reflected by an uptick in spending for gas, electricity and healthcare services, which were partially offset by a reduction in spending in new vehicles. Over the last 12 months, the PCE Price Index has increased by 0.9% -- remaining unchanged from the year-over-year gains exhibited in May.
The Core PCE Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, inched up by 0.1% in June, in line with consensus estimates and below May's 0.2% monthly increase. On an annual basis, Core personal consumption expenditures are up by 1.6%, unchanged from May's level. At last week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) July monetary policy meeting, the Committee said market-based measures of inflation continue to remain low, as the Core PCE index hovers below its long-term targeted objective of 2%.
While delivering a speech on monetary policy and the global economy in Beijing, Dallas Fed president Rob Kaplan urged the U.S. central bank to raise rates in a ""gradual and patient manner,"" amid continuing challenges facing the U.S. economy.

Last week, the FOMC left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a level between 0.25 and 0.50% for a fifth consecutive meeting.
Any rate hikes this year are viewed as bearish for gold, which struggles to compete versus high-yield bearing assets in periods of rising rate environments.

Abe's economic stimulus plan was approved mere days after the Bank of Japan surprised markets by implementing only modest easing measures at a closely-watched meeting last week. The $274 billion stimulus is one of the Japanese government's largest since the Financial Crisis and comes amid growing sentiment that Japan's economy will need to rely upon fiscal, not monetary policy in order to stave off deflation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 1 percent on Tuesday, erasing early gains and pushing U.S. crude back below $40 a barrel as persistent worries of a glut offset the impact of a weak dollar that initially propped the market.
A slide in U.S. equities also forced U.S. crude futures, which plunged below the $40 level on Monday for the first time since April, to give back early gains of as much as 2 percent, traders said. 
""There is much talk about the product glut replacing the oil glut, and this is a worrisome indicator for crude demand,"" said Frank Klumpp, oil analyst at Stuttgart-based Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 50 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $39.56 a barrel by 12:15 p.m. EDT (1615 GMT). It had risen to $40.91 earlier. 
Brent crude fell 30 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $41.84 a barrel, after rising to $43.18 earlier.
The dollar hit a six-week low, propping oil initially, before U.S. stocks fell to a three-week trough, mitigating the rebound. [USD/] (N)
""I am bullish here overall but worry about being too early,"" said Scott Shelton, energy futures broker at ICAP (LON:IAP) in Durham, North Carolina. ""I also wonder if the market is going to chop around a bit first, like it did in late May to June before dropping after many threw in the towel.""
Oil hit 2016 highs above $50 a barrel between late May and June as crude supplies tightened from disruptions in Canada, Nigeria and Libyan energy sectors, and a near economic meltdown in OPEC member Venezuela. The rally faded soon after as higher prices spurred more crude and refined product output.
Oil traders and investors expect the U.S. government to report on Wednesday that crude inventories fell 1.4 million barrels last week after a surprise build the previous week that broke a nine-week drawdown. Trade group American Petroleum Institute (API) will issue a preliminary report at 4:30 p.m. EDT on Tuesday ahead of the government data. [EIA/S]
But the forecast draw pales to the global oil inventory situation. Fuel stockpiles across the world are brimming as refineries have churned out huge volumes of diesel, gasoline and jet fuel, squeezing refining margins as demand lagged supply.
Meanwhile, crude remains oversupplied as top oil producers in OPEC pump at near record high levels. Saudi Arabia also cut at the weekend its crude selling price to Asian customers, signaling the start of another price war and tussle for market share among producers. 
Hedge funds have turned rather bearish toward both crude and refined products over the last two months amid signs of a gasoline glut.

""With the market continuously focusing on oversupply, this bearish trend seems hard to change in the near term,"" said Hans van Cleef, ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) senior energy economist.

Natural gas for delivery in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange sank to a daily low of $2.735 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since July 28.
It was last at $2.769 by 14:35GMT, or 10:35AM ET, down 0.2 cents, or 0.12%.
On Monday, prices tumbled 10.5 cents, or 3.65%, as traders reacted to milder weather and the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Losses were limited as market players looked ahead to weekly supply data due on Thursday, which is expected to show an increase of just 10 billion cubic feet of gas in the week ended July 29, as a recent heat wave prompted households to ramp up their air conditioning.
That compares with a build of 17 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 41 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 54 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.294 trillion cubic feet, 13.2% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 15.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

Hickenlooper, a former geologist, called the issue a ""tricky thing"" when asked why he thought Trump was wrong to support locals' ability to ban fracking, the publication wrote.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's government has resumed cash payments for former militants in the restive Niger Delta, an official said on Monday, in a bid to end a wave a wave of militant attacks on oil and gas facilities.
In February, Nigeria stopped the payments for former militants who agreed under a 2009 amnesty to stop blowing up crude pipelines in exchange for cash, the official said.
The government says it has been holding talks with militants they suspect of being behind a recent wave of attacks on pipelines that has reduced Nigeria's crude output by 700,000 barrels a day.
""Payments of stipends to the ex-militants resumed this Monday. The payments are done directly from the CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) to their bank accounts,"" said the amnesty program's media officer Piriye Kiyaramo.
""The payment also includes tuition for those studying abroad,"" he said. ""Their last payment was in February this year. Now we are clearing all outstanding and the payments.""
Each of the former militant is entitled under the amnesty to 65,000 naira ($203.44) monthly plus job training. But the government had originally planned to cut the amnesty by two-thirds and limit cash payments amid a budget crisis and graft.
The militants and residents who sympathize with them say they want a greater share of Nigeria's oil wealth to go to the impoverished region.
Crude sales make up about 70 percent of government revenue and the attacks have deepened an economic crisis brought on by low global oil prices.
In June, government officials said a one-month ceasefire had been reached. But Niger Delta Avengers, the group that has claimed responsibility for the majority of attacks dating back to January, said it had not agreed a truce.
Since then the group has said it would not take part in talks unless international mediators were involved.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture said its Food Safety and Inspection Service had determined that Brazil's food safety system for meat was up to U.S. standards and that fresh (chilled and frozen) Brazilian beef can be safely imported.
This means that Brazil, the world's largest beef exporter, will now be able to send raw beef to the United States from every part of the country, not just the southern state of Santa Catarina, which already could due to its sanitary track record.
Brazilian Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi, who was in Washington last week to nail down the agreement, said the U.S. food safety seal of approval will now open other markets to Brazilian beef.
Maggi said exports could begin in 90 days once paperwork was completed. He said an initial quota of 60,000 tons of Brazilian beef should enter the United States this year.
A green light for fresh beef shipments to the United States could help Brazil gain access to other key markets, such as Japan and South Korea, which have banned all beef imports since a mad cow disease scare in late 2012.
The World Animal Health Organization has maintained Brazil's status as a country with an insignificant risk of the disease. Brazil is already a steady exporter of cooked beef that appears in items such as canned corned beef in the United States.

The agreement, which took years to negotiate, has long been awaited by Brazil's JBS S.A. (SA:JBSS3), Latin America's largest meat producer that in 2007 purchased Swift Foods Co, the third-largest U.S. processor of beef and pork.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude tumbled below $40 per barrel on Monday for the first time since April, as oil prices settled down nearly 4 percent on heightened worries of a crude glut despite peak summer fuel demand.
A near 15-percent slump in U.S. crude prices in July, the worst monthly loss in a year, also triggered liquidation as trading began for August.
Monday's slide in crude prices also came after Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) unexpectedly shut its lone crude unit and an associated unit at its 212,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Robinson, Illinois, at the weekend, according to a source. The cause and duration of the outage were not clear.

""We've had crude builds during the summer, when we were supposed to be having runaway draws from record driving.""

Brent crude closed down $1.39, or 3.2 percent, at $42.14 a barrel, after a session low of $41.87.
Not all oil statistics are bearish. A Reuters poll on Monday showed U.S. crude stockpiles may have fallen last week for the first time in 10 weeks. 
Still, market focus was on reports such as the Reuters survey on Friday which showed that output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries likely rose in July to its highest in recent history as Saudi Arabia pumped at near optimum level, Iraq raised production and Nigeria boosted crude exports.
Other data from last week showed the United States added 44 oil drilling rigs in July, the most for a month in two years, intensifying concerns that global production could again get to unmanageable levels like in 2014-2015.
Crude prices remain nearly 55 percent above 12-year lows of $26 to $27 hit in the first quarter.
But WTI and Brent have also slipped into bear market territory since last week after losing more than 20 percent from the 2016 highs above $50 that were hit in June.
Hedge funds slashed their positive bets on U.S. crude to a five-month low during the week to July 26, while holding a record net short, or bearish position, on gasoline, data showed on Friday.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) noted that Brent averaged $46.50 a barrel so far into the third quarter and could fall further.
""With the macroeconomic picture worsening and Saudi Arabia unlikely to exhibit much restraint as Iran seeks incremental market share, refineries are going to find themselves in the line of fire,"" the British bank said in a research note.

Iran's oil minister concurred the market was oversupplied but said balance between supply and demand will be restored, Iranian state television reported.

1107,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2016 02:41PM ET</span>",EPA should change biofuels program to help small fuel retailers: letter,"By Chris Prentice
(Reuters) - U.S. regulators should alter a much-debated biofuels program that disadvantages small fuel retailers, said the chairman of a newly-formed coalition, joining the likes of refiners including  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO), which have made a similar push.
The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) gives an unfair advantage to large petroleum retailers and sidelines smaller ones, Bill Douglass, the founder of Texas-based Douglass Distributing and Chairman of the Small Retailers Coalition, said in a letter to Janet McCabe, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) acting assistant administrator for air and radiation.
The EPA oversees the RFS, setting annual targets as to how many gallons of ethanol and other renewable fuels need to be blended with gasoline and diesel. Oil refiners and importers are required to prove compliance with the policy by either blending biofuels or buying paper credits, known as RINs, from companies that are in compliance.
Higher annual targets and soaring prices for RINs have prompted Valero and other refiners to press the agency to consider pushing the obligation to comply with the program to later this year. 
The EPA is considering a petition from refiner Valero to consider altering the RFS to push the onus of proving compliance from oil refiners further downstream to companies that blend the fuels. 
The fact that small retailers are joining refiners in the push is significant. Large fuel retailers have historically opposed the change. Companies like fuel retailers, which blend fuels, benefit from selling RINs to obligated parties such as refiners.
Those profits could soar this year as prices of the credits have jumped to highs not seen since 2013 on supply worries due to more ambitious targets for biofuels, fueling the complaints from refiners. Biofuels supporters note that the higher profits from blending biofuels help justify the costs to overhaul infrastructure to introduce the new fuels.
But the ""windfall profits"" from selling RINs gives large fuel retailers an unfair advantage over smaller ones in a business that is largely about scale, Douglass said in the letter dated July 28.
""The current system needlessly tilts the playing field toward large retailers,"" Douglass said.
In May, the EPA proposed targets for biofuels use in 2017 that disappointed both biofuels producers and oil companies alike.

The more than decade-old RFS has been stymied by regulatory delays and has been the subject of years-long lobbying battle between so-called Big Corn and Big Oil.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2016 12:10PM ET</span>","Turkey, Russia pursue gas pipe dream as EU frets","By Alissa de Carbonnel and Vladimir Soldatkin
BRUSSELS/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Declarations by Russia and Turkey last week reviving plans for the TurkStream natural gas pipeline linking the two have worried EU diplomats who see it strengthening Moscow's hand - but analysts say the project is more rhetoric than reality.
EU officials fear that TurkStream will be expanded to bypass Ukraine as a transit route for supplies to Europe, increasing dependence on Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom (MM:GAZP) and shutting in alternative supplies from the Caspian region. ""Turkey's new friendship with Russia might become an issue if Russia tries to replace Turkey for Ukraine,"" a senior EU official said. ""It makes sense for Turkey to get cheap gas from Russia, but it will come with strings attached: That is likely to be a problem for us.""
However, the entente, almost a year after Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane, remains fragile, analysts say, particularly amid turmoil caused by the failed coup in Turkey. ""In times of instability, if you are sane, you don't commit to huge infrastructure projects,"" said Simone Tagliapietra, an energy fellow with Brussels-based think tank Bruegel.
Moscow and Ankara are more keen on ""signaling political messages than about advancing projects in reality,"" he said. Russia's drive to reroute gas to Europe around Ukraine, including by expanding the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany, has met with heated opposition in Brussels since Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in March 2014, prompting EU sanctions. Turkey's own role in facing off with Russia and as an energy corridor has tempered EU criticism of President Tayyip Erdogan authoritarian turn.
EU officials will be watching warily as Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin are set to agree a deal on TurkStream next month at their first meeting since Russia imposed sanctions over Turkey's shooting down of the jet near the Syrian border last November. For now, Russia is planning construction of two out of an initial four projected pipelines. Capacity of one line is around15.75 billion cubic metres of gas per year. That would mean retaining gas flows via Ukraine - albeit reduced - after Moscow's transit contract with Kiev expires in 2019. Ukraine plans to ship around 72 bcm of Russian gas in 2016 - more than 40 percent of Russia's gas supplies to Europe. Part of the line would lay along the same route as Russia's canceled South Stream pipeline, which ran up against EU opposition on competition grounds in late 2014.
TurkStream follows a different logic, delivering gas only to the EU's border to avoid falling foul of EU rules.
NO MORE THAN ONE STRING 
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday Turkey will ""play a large role as a transit country"" to supply Europe - the very prospect which worries EU officials. 
Brussels is instead promoting a chain of pipelines known as the Southern Gas Corridor to transport gas from the Shah Deniz field in Azerbaijan to European markets by 2020. 
""We follow the developments in Turkey closely,"" European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic said in an email to Reuters. ""Turkey is fully aware of its responsibility as a key country for the implementation of the Southern Gas Corridor."" 
Shaky Russian-Turkish ties are just one reason analysts are sceptical TurkStream will be built to its full, 63 bcm capacity. 
""I don't believe Russia wants to replace a problematic Ukrainian relationship with a problematic Turkish one,"" said Katja Yafimava of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. 
Turkey, Russia's second-largest gas market after Germany, has its own worries about being too reliant on Russian gas. TurkStream also competes with Russia's own plans to double capacity along the Nord Stream route to Germany, with European demand too weak to justify both projects, experts say.

""Turkish Stream will give way,"" said Sijbren de Jong, an analyst with the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies. ""It is highly unlikely that the pipeline will extend into Southeastern Europe.""

The disappointing report suggesting a downward revision to the second-quarter economic growth estimate published last week is on the horizon.
In a separate report, U.S. factories expanded for a fifth straight month in July, another sign that U.S. manufacturers are recovering from damage caused by a strong dollar, according to the Institute of Supply Management.
Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped $1.35, or 0.1% to trade at $1,356.25 a troy ounce by 14:30GMT, or 10:30AM ET.
On Friday, prices jumped to $1,362.00, the most since July 11, after data showed the U.S. economy grew much slower than expected in the second quarter, sending the dollar to five-week lows and prompting market players to roll back expectations of a rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
The advance read on second quarter GDP showed a 1.2% annualized growth rate, well below expectations for 2.6%, the Commerce Department said on Friday. First quarter GDP was revised lower to 0.8% from 1.1%.
The disappointing data lessened the threat of an early interest rate rise from the Federal Reserve. Fed funds futures are currently pricing in just a 12% chance of a rate hike by September. December odds were at 33%, down from 43% ahead of the GDP report and compared to 53% at the start of last week.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, plunged to a five-week low of 95.34 in wake of the disappointing GDP report. It was at 95.65 by early Monday.
The precious metal scored a weekly gain of $33.30, or 1.96%, last week, after the Fed left interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its policy meeting and said near-term risks to the U.S. economic outlook had diminished. However, the central bank stopped short of signaling that a further increase in U.S. interest rates is on the cards for later this year.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
Gold ended July with a gain of 3%. For the year, prices are up nearly 26%, boosted by concerns over global growth and expectations of monetary stimulus.
The yellow metal surged to a more than two-year high of $1,377.50 in early July, as concerns surrounding global growth in wake of Britain’s vote to exit the European Union sent investors flooding into safe haven assets.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for September delivery tacked on 11.5 cents, or 0.57%, to trade at $20.46 a troy ounce during morning hours in New York, while copper futures shed 1.0 cent, or 0.47%, to $2.211 a pound.
China's manufacturing sector painted a mixed picture in July, with the official activity gauge unexpectedly slipping into contraction territory while another survey pointed to an expansion for the first time in 17 months.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers' index, which tracks the health of large and state-owned enterprises, fell to 49.9 in July from 50.0 a month earlier, the first contraction in five months.
Meanwhile, the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, which covers a greater share of small-to-medium sized companies, rose to 50.6 last month, expanding for the first time in 17 months.
The 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction.
The Asian nation is the world’s largest copper consumer, accounting for nearly 45% of world consumption.

Natural gas for delivery in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 4.9 cents, or 1.7%, to trade at $2.827 per million British thermal units by 13:40GMT, or 9:40AM ET.
On Friday, prices climbed to $2.911, the most since July 5, as sentiment improved after a government report showed the smallest inventory gain in a decade.
Natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 17 billion cubic feet last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the smallest storage injection for the same period since a withdrawal was reported in 2006.
That came in below forecasts for an increase of 26 billion and compared with an increase of 34 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 49 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 52 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.294 trillion cubic feet, 13.2% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 15.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas prices climbed 3.5% last week as investors bet a heat wave making its way across the continental U.S. will prompt households to ramp up their air conditioning.
Parts of the Northeast and the mid-Atlantic will experience a heat wave this week. The heat will persist into next month, according to updated weather forecasting models.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

Crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell to a session low of $40.88 a barrel. It was last at $41.05 by 12:40GMT, or 8:40AM ET, down 55 cents, or 1.32%.
On Friday, New York-traded oil sank to $40.57, a level not seen since April 20, after data showed that the U.S. oil rig count rose for the fifth week in a row last week.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week increased by three to 374, the fifth straight weekly gain and the eighth increase in nine weeks.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.
New York-traded oil futures lost $2.60, or 5.86%, last week, the second weekly decline in a row. For July, U.S. oil prices dropped 14%, its worst monthly performance in a year.
WTI crude futures are nearly 20% lower from their 2016 highs above $50 a barrel scaled in early June, technically placing it in bear market territory, as signs of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity combined with elevated stocks of fuel products weighed.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, gasoline inventories increased by 452,000 barrels last week. Despite being in the midst of the peak summer-driving season in the U.S., gasoline stocks are well above the upper limit of the average range, according to the EIA.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for October delivery shed 61 cents, or 1.4%, to $42.92 a barrel, after falling to a more than three-month low of $42.52 on Friday.
Last week, London-traded Brent futures declined $3.24, or 7.07%, the second straight weekly fall. Brent prices ended July with a monthly loss of 12.7% as prospects of increased exports from Middle Eastern and North African producers, such as Iraq, Nigeria and Libya, added to concerns that a glut of oil products will cut demand for crude by refiners.
OPEC's oil output is likely in July to reach its highest in recent history, a Reuters survey found on Friday, as Iraq pumps more and Nigeria manages to export additional crude despite militant attacks on oil installations.
Supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has risen to 33.41 million barrels per day (bpd) in July from a revised 33.31 million bpd in June, according to the survey based on shipping data and information from industry sources.
Meanwhile, in Libya, the country's government reached a deal with a brigade controlling the Ras Lanuf and Es Sider oil ports, the major oil terminals that have been shut since December 2014, to restart exports there as part of a political agreement, officials said Friday.
Brent is down almost 18% since peaking above $50 in early June, as high inventories of gasoline products cloud the future outlook for crude.
According to market experts, elevated stocks of fuel products amid slowing global demand growth is expected to keep prices under pressure in the near-term.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in September fell 0.65% to $41.33 a barrel.
Australia said the AIG manufacturing index for July spiked to 56.4, compared with last month's figure at 51.8. Then comes HIA new home sales for June with the last figure down 4.4% month-on-month.
In China, the semi-official manufacturing PMI published by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing for July is expected to hit bang-on 50, the same as last month. The CFLP non-manufacturing PMI is also due, with last month's level at 53.7.
Later, the Caixin manufacturing PMI is due with a reading of 48.7 expected for July, which was up a tad from 48.6 the previous month.
In the coming week, the U.S. reports nonfarm payrolls data and ISM data on both manufacturing and service sector activity.
As well, the weekly U.S. stockpile data on Tuesday and Wednesday will be watched for fresh supply-and-demand signals.
Last week, oil futures ended Friday’s session slightly higher, rebounding from bear-market territory as investors went bargain-buying after prices fell to the lowest level in more than three months amid persistent concerns over a supply glut.
Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week increased by three to 374, the fifth straight weekly rise and the eighth increase in nine weeks.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, gasoline inventories increased by 452,000 barrels last week. Despite being in the midst of the peak summer-driving season in the U.S., gasoline stocks are well above the upper limit of the average range, according to the EIA.
The report also showed that total crude oil inventories rose by a surprising 1.7 million barrels to 521.1 million barrels, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for September delivery traded between $40.58 and $41.66 a barrel before closing at $41.52, up 0.38 or 0.92% on the session. Despite halting a four-day losing streak, WTI crude still ended July down roughly 13% on the month. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for October delivery wavered between $42.52 and $43.60 a barrel, before settling at $43.47, up 0.24 or 0.56% on the day.
Oil futures bounced off three-month lows on Friday, as the U.S. Dollar fell sharply amid weak GDP data and a soaring Yen. It came after the Bank of Japan rattled markets by approving only modest easing measures at a highly-anticipated meeting in Tokyo. Heading into the monetary policy meeting, the BOJ was widely expected to cut interest rates and expand Quantitative Easing in an effort to boost persistently sluggish inflation. The BOJ also ignored calls from the Japanese government to use all the tools necessary to lower the Yen in order to jumpstart soft exports. As a result, the Dollar plunged more than 2.5% against the Yen to an intraday-low of 102.12, its lowest level in nearly three weeks.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 1% on Friday to an intraday low of 95.67. The index is on pace for its fifth straight losing session after hitting four-month highs at 97.62 on Monday. Dollar-denominated commodities such as Crude become more expensive for foreign purchasers when the dollar appreciates.
Elsewhere, oil services firm Baker Hughes said in its Weekly Rig Count report that U.S. oil rigs last week rose by three to 374. It marked the fifth consecutive week of weekly increases among oil rigs nationwide. At the same time, the overall rig count ticked up by one to 463, as gas rigs fell by two to 89.
Shares in  Exxon Mobil  Corporation (NYSE:XOM) fell sharply after the multinational oil and gas giant badly missed analysts' earnings forecasts last quarter. On Friday, ExxonMobil reported earnings of $1.7 billion or 0.41 per share, its worst quarterly profit since 1999. For the quarter, net profits tumbled 59% on an annual basis due to the low cost of oil.
Crude prices have come under pressure in recent weeks, as oil companies in Canada, Nigeria and Libya continue to return online. Over the spring, a wave of production disruptions in the aforementioned countries cushioned oil from further losses after a comprehensive Doha agreement in April abruptly collapsed. Despite reports from the International Energy Agency (IEA) that the imbalance in the global supply-demand could be on the verge of leveling off, data released this week has shown otherwise. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Energy reported an unexpected inventory build of 1.7 million barrels last week pushing stockpiles to 521.1 million barrels, near record-highs for this time of the year. U.S. production, meanwhile, moved higher for a third consecutive week.
Crude futures have been enmeshed in a two-year downturn since OPEC roiled markets in November, 2014 by maintaining its production ceiling above 30 million barrels per day. The strategic decision triggered a prolonged battle for market share between the U.S. and producers in the Middle East, saturating global markets with a glut of oversupply. Since peaking at $115 a barrel two years ago, oil prices have tumbled by more than 60%."

Citing an uncertain outlook in global financial markets and expectations for a slowdown in emerging economies stemming from last month's Brexit decision, the BOJ approved moderate stimulus measures at Friday's monetary policy meeting. While the Japanese Central Bank took some action on Friday by upping the level of ETF purchases from ¥3.3 to 6 trillion, the BOJ largely fell short of market expectations for further interest rate cuts and expanded Quantitative Easing. In a 7-2 vote, the BOJ held its deposit rate at Minus-0.1% and maintained its monetary base target at ¥80 trillion. Consequently, USD/JPY immediately crashed more than 2.5% in overnight trading, before falling to an intraday-low of 102.12, its lowest level in nearly three weeks.
""The Bank will continue with (QE) with a Negative Interest Rate,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner,"" the BOJ said in a statement. ""It will examine risks to economic activity and prices, and take additional easing measures in terms of three dimensions -- quantity, quality, and the interest rate -- if it is judged necessary for achieving the price stability target.""
Elsewhere, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said Friday that preliminary GDP for the second quarter rose by 1.2%, far below consensus estimates of 2.6%.

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2016 10:50AM ET</span>",OPEC oil output set to reach record high in July: survey,"By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC's oil output is likely in July to reach its highest in recent history, a Reuters survey found on Friday, as Iraq pumps more and Nigeria manages to export additional crude despite militant attacks on oil installations.
Top OPEC exporter Saudi Arabia has kept output close to a record high, the survey found, as it meets seasonally higher domestic demand and focuses on maintaining market share rather than trimming supply to boost prices.
Supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has risen to 33.41 million barrels per day (bpd) in July from a revised 33.31 million bpd in June, according to the survey based on shipping data and information from industry sources.
The increase in OPEC production has added to downward pressure on prices. Oil (LCOc1) has fallen from a 2016 high near $53 a barrel in June to $42 as of Friday, pressured also by concern about weaker demand.
OPEC's production could rise even further should talks to reopen some of Libya's oil facilities succeed. Conflict has been keeping Libyan output at a fraction of the pre-war rate.
""This could shortly release more oil into an already abundantly supplied market,"" Carsten Fritsch of Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said, although earlier hopes of a restart have not been realized. 
""It therefore remains to be seen whether this time will be different."" 
OPEC's output has climbed due to the return of former member Indonesia in 2015 and another, Gabon, this month, skewing historical comparisons. July's supply from the remaining members, at 32.46 million bpd, is the highest in Reuters survey records, starting in 1997. 
Supply has also risen since OPEC abandoned in 2014 its historic role of cutting supply to prop up prices as major producers Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran pump more.
In July, the biggest increase of 90,000 bpd has come from Iraq, which has exported more barrels from its southern and northern ports despite a pipeline leak that restrained southern exports.
Nigeria, where output has been hit by militant attacks on oil facilities, has nonetheless exported slightly more in July than June, the survey found, although crude exports remain significantly below the 2 million bpd seen in early 2016.
Output in two major producers is largely stable. Iran, OPEC's fastest-growing source of supply expansion this year after the lifting of Western sanctions, has pumped only 20,000 bpd more as the growth rate tops out for now, the survey found.
Saudi output in July was assessed at 10.50 million bpd, close to June's revised rate and the record 10.56 million bpd reached in June last year.
""Exports are down a bit, offset by higher direct burn and slightly higher refinery runs,"" said an industry source who monitors Saudi output. ""For the time being, I'm sticking to my numbers, which suggest supply is flat.""
Of countries with lower production, Libyan output edged down due to the stoppage of a major oilfield, Sarir.
Venezuela's supply is under downward pressure from its cash crunch, slipping further in July.

The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data, and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2016 09:42AM ET</span>",Taxing times: why Russian pump prices rise as oil prices fall,"By Maxim Nazarov and Olesya Astakhova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The global economic slowdown has hurt millions of households, but has at least had a silver lining: with oil prices falling, the cost of filling up a vehicle with fuel has dropped. 
Except, that is, in Russia.
While in the past two years world oil prices have fallen 60 percent (LCOc1), the prices at the pump for gasoline in Russia - one of the world's biggest oil producers - have risen 11 percent.
A Reuters analysis of the pricing structure for Russian fuel has revealed a major reason for this anomaly: a large chunk of the savings that consumers would be making from lower world prices are instead being eaten up by the government in the form of higher taxes.
Fuel consumption is falling yet, according to Reuters calculations, the Russian state budget is on track to take in about 200 billion rubles ($3 billion) more in excise tax on fuel this year than it did last year.
That extra money is about 1.4 percent of projected budget revenues for this year, or roughly what it will cost the Kremlin to build a planned bridge connecting southern Russia to Crimea, the region it annexed from Ukraine.
In this way the Russian government, struggling with lower oil export income and Western sanctions, has been able to plug holes in the budget largely at the expense of motorists - but without the politically risky step of publicly raising taxes imposed directly on consumers, like sales tax.
The Russian finance ministry did not respond to questions submitted by Reuters.
The excise tax on fuel - which is levied as the product leaves refineries but is ultimately passed on to consumers - was raised in January this year, and then again in April. This has passed unnoticed among many people in Russia, both because it did not involve a direct tax on consumers and because the effect on pump prices was partly masked by the falling oil price. 
Customers filling up their vehicles around Russia told Reuters they were exasperated that the fall in oil prices had not translated into cheaper fuel, but they were not aware of the role played by excise tax in keeping prices high.
""I still don't understand why the pump prices are going up when the oil price is so low,"" said a pensioner, who gave his name as Sergei, and was filling up his rusty Lada saloon at a fuel station in the Tver region, north of Russia, in June. 
""Apparently, someone's doing well out of it.""
LOST SAVINGS
The price at the pump in July this year of a liter of Ai-92 fuel, the most commonly-used grade in Russia, was 34.4 rubles. That was up 11 percent on July 2014, when the world old price started plummeting.
For comparison, over the same period in the United States, another major oil producer, the price of a liter of gasoline fell by 38 percent, broadly tracking the falling crude price.
Fuel excise tax is not the only reason Russian fuel has not grown cheaper. Wholesale prices for fuel on the domestic Russian market have gone up. That is because the government cut export duties for oil products. Under a formula designed to stop fuel draining from the domestic market when profits from exports are higher, the wholesale price went up accordingly. 
However, the increase in excise taxes and associated taxes has made pump prices higher than they would be otherwise.
In 2015, before the duty was increased, excise tax and value added tax accounted for 9.1 rubles on the price of a liter of Ai-92 fuel, according to Reuters calculations.
By this year, the excise tax and value added tax accounted for 12.6 rubles on the price of a liter.
In an annex to the legislation which increased fuel duty in April, the ministry said that the increase would not hurt consumers because world oil prices were falling. It did not address the issue of the savings motorists would otherwise have made.
""The increase in the tax burden, leading to price rises for oil products on the territory of the Russian Federation, has canceled out the fall in oil prices,"" Russia's state anti-monopoly service says on its website.
PAIN FOR CONSUMERS
The de facto tax at the fuel pump is, according to some economists, consistent with the way the Russian state has responded to the economic crisis as a whole: passing on much of the pain to ordinary people.
In particular, the authorities allowed the rouble currency to weaken. That helped balance the budget because it meant that dollar-denominated oil and gas revenues could stretch further in paying for rouble-denominated services. It also made Russian exporting companies more competitive.
However, it pushed up the price of consumer goods, many of which have to be imported. Inflation last year was 12.9 percent, while nominal wages rose very little.
Instead of blaming the government for the high fuel prices, some consumers view the oil companies as the villains.
""People are kind of angry,"" said Alexei, a fuel pump worker from Vladimir region, in central Russia, who did not give his full name because he is not authorized to speak to the media .
He said before the fall in world oil prices, he would on average earn between 200 and 250 rubles a day in tips from customers, for whom he would operate the pumps.
""Now it's nothing like that ... recently one person pushed me away (and said): 'I'll fill it up myself'."" He said the customer ended up spraying fuel over himself because he did not know how to operate the nozzle.
But fuel companies say they are not to blame.
Executives or owners at five gas station operators said their margins had been squeezed because they were paying more duty.
""The big companies can let their retail operations operate at zero (profit), or at a loss, for one year, or two,"" said Rustam Vishyankov, owner of a private chain of fuel stations in Vladimir region. 

""We won't even last a few months. What am I going to pay my staff with?"" he asked.

1127,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2016 07:40AM ET</span>","Oil rally to resume later this year, demand to offset glut: Reuters poll","(Reuters) - Oil analysts still expect a rise in the crude price this year, thanks to improving demand growth that should help offset any bearish headwinds from a stubborn supply surplus, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
A survey of 29 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude will average $45.51 per barrel in 2016, up marginally from last month's forecast of $45.20, and about $3.55 higher than the $41.96 average so far this year. 
    ""We project solid global demand growth in 2016 (1.4 million barrels per day), and a reasonable growth in 2017 (+1.1 MMBbl/d), mostly driven by China, India and Africa. As such, demand should help to drive prices higher,"" said Raymond James analyst Luana Siegfried.
    This is the fifth straight upward revision in forecasts for the North Sea crude benchmark.
    Oil prices are still some 60 percent above the near 13-year lows seen in January this year, but have retreated from 2016 highs above $50 a barrel, as a growing glut of refined products could force more unwanted crude into storage, analysts said. 
    Global supply is still greater than demand, but production disruptions, often through geopolitical instability, have helped to erode part of the prevailing overhang, according to Giorgos Beleris, analyst at Thomson Reuters' Oil Research and Forecasts.
    The poll showed analysts expect Brent crude futures to average around $51.15 a barrel in the fourth quarter, as supply demand dynamics improve.
    ""Geopolitical risks remain the price supporting factor,"" with the risk of terror attacks in the West and in the Middle East, said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
    A series of militant attacks on oil infrastructure this month has cut Nigerian output and repairs are expected to take at least another month. 
Libya meanwhile is facing a blockade at key oil terminals due to protests against a turbulent political backdrop.
A sudden return of exports from either country could put pressure on oil prices, but Commerzbank's Fritsch said this was unlikely in the near term.
Brent crude futures are expected to average $58.63 per barrel in 2017, rising to $66.28 in 2018, the poll showed.
    The survey forecast U.S. WTI crude futures to average $44.12 a barrel in 2016, up from last month's forecast of $43.90. U.S. crude oil has averaged $40.47 this year so far.     
    Raymond James had the highest 2016 Brent forecast at $53.15 per barrel, while the Economist Intelligence Unit had the lowest at $40.34.

U.S. crude futures for September delivery dropped 0.80% to a three-month low of $40.83 a barrel.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the October Brent contract tumbled 0.99% to $42.80 a barrel, the lowest since April.
Crude prices remained under pressure after the Energy Information Administration said that crude oil inventories rose by a surprising 1.7 million barrels last week to 521.1 million barrels, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 452,000 barrels. Despite being in the midst of the peak summer-driving season in the U.S., gasoline stocks are well above the upper limit of the average range, according to the EIA.
U.S. oil has been under pressure in recent weeks as signs of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity combined with elevated stocks of fuel products weighed.
Oil prices are down nearly 18% since peaking above $50 in early June, as high inventories of gasoline products cloud the future outlook for crude.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell to their lowest levels since April on Friday, with on Brent track for its biggest monthly loss since December 2015, pressured by slowing economic growth that threatened to increase a supply overhang of crude and refined products.
Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) were trading at $41.89 by 0908 GMT (5:08 a.m. ET), down 81 cents, their lowest since April. The benchmark was poised for a monthly loss of more than 15.5 percent, its biggest since December 2015. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) fell 54 cents to $40.60 a barrel, slipping below $41 for the first time since April. It was on track for a roughly 16 percent monthly loss, the biggest in a year. 
Both crude benchmarks are now down around 20 percent since their last peak in June.
The glut in the market has taken the edge off supply disruptions in Libya and Nigeria, particularly as high stocks of oil products had cast doubt on refinery demand. [CRU/OUT]
""Doubts are rife as to whether the oil supply imbalance is indeed slowly drawing to an end,"" Stephen Brennock of oil brokerage PVM, said. 
""Oil prices should eventually resume their upward journey but it will be a subdued affair with the huge stock overhang tempering gains until the end of next year at the very least,"" he said. 
Cheap crude has led refiners to produce lots of refined products, which has pushed down margins in the Americas, Europe and Asia this year, eroding revenues for oil producers and refiners like Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), which this week reported a big drop in earnings.
Benchmark Singapore refinery margins  are down 60 percent from their January highs to $4.28 per barrel. Italian oil company  ENI  (MI:ENI) said on Friday that its standard refining margin in the second quarter was roughly half the level of last year at just $4.60 per barrel. 
""Margins remain on a negative trajectory ... This seems a clear signal that Atlantic Basin refined product markets are currently oversupplied,"" Jason Gammel of U.S. investment bank Jefferies said on Friday.
On the supply side, Iranian exports to Asia's main buyers - China, India, Japan and South Korea - jumped 47.1 percent in June from a year ago to 1.72 million barrels per day, the highest levels in over four years.
The sales jump is the latest sign that Tehran's aggressive moves to recoup market share, lost under international sanctions, are paying off.
Because of ongoing oversupply, U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (N:GS) said this week that it did not expect a big recovery in prices any time soon.

""We continue to expect that oil prices will remain in a $45 per barrel to $50 per barrel trading range through mid-2017 with near-term risks skewed to the downside,"" the bank said.

At least two members of the U.N.-backed Presidential Council were in Ras Lanuf for negotiations with the Petroleum Facilities Guards brigade, which controls Ras Lanuf and Es Sider ports, a government official and local media reported. No details were available on any deal struck to reopen the port.
Opening Ras Lanuf and Es Sider would add a potential 600,000 barrels per day capacity to Libya's crude exports, though experts estimate damage from fighting and the long stoppage must be repaired before exports are at full capacity again.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for December delivery were little changed at $1,341.75.
The August contract ended Thursday’s session 0.50% higher at $1,341.20 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,330.10, Thursday’s low and resistance at $1,356.90, the high from July 12.
At the conclusion of its monthly policy meeting on Friday, the BoJ announced a modest increase in purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but maintained its base money target at 80 trillion yen as well as the pace of purchases for other assets.
The central bank also kept negative interest rates unchanged at -0.1%.
The move disappointed expectations for a stimulus package of nearly 28 trillion yen promised by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier in the week to boost the economy.
The BoJ’s decision came after the Fed left interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, in a widely expected move, which weighed heavily on the U.S. dollar.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.41% at 96.29, the lowest level since July 15.
Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
In its monthly policy statement, the Fed said that “near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished” and that the labor market has “strengthened”.
Market participants were eyeing the release of second quarter U.S. economic growth data, due later Friday for further indications on the strength of the economy.
Elsewhere in metals trading, silver futures for September delivery slipped 0.12% to $20.168 a troy ounce, while copper futures for September delivery dropped 0.68% to $2.195 a pound."

The Wall Street bank, which turned bullish on oil earlier this year, said oil prices will remain in a $45 a barrel to $50 a barrel trading range through mid-2017, with near-term risks skewed to the downside due to high inventory levels and the possibility of a stronger dollar.
""Beyond these near-term uncertainties, however, our updated supply-demand balance is little changed and still points to a slow rebalancing of the global oil market over the coming year,"" the U.S. bank said in a note dated Wednesday. 
Oil prices on Friday were hovering around April lows as slowing economic growth added to concerns about oversupply of crude and refined products [O/R]
Goldman said it viewed a rise in product inventories as a result of too much refining capacity and strong margins, not weak demand. It did not expect rising gasoline stocks to act as a catalyst for further price declines.
""In our view, it would take a global demand slowdown, a sudden sharp halt in China's crude inventory build or a ramp up in Libya or Nigeria production to take prices back below $35 per barrel, with each able to fully offset the 2H16 deficit of 230,000 barrels per day that we project."" 
The bank said global demand growth has been frontloaded to H1 and growth should moderate in the second half due to headwinds in China, India and Japan. It also lowered its forecast for 2017 by 120,000 barrels per day to 1.2 million barrels per day, mainly due to a decline in European demand following Britain's exit from the EU.

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2016 01:10AM ET</span>","Wholesale California gasoline prices plunge, consumers still pay up","By Liz Hampton and Jessica Resnick-Ault
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Wholesale gasoline in California became the cheapest in the country this week, but that change has largely gone unseen at the pump, where consumers are still paying the highest prices in the continental United States to fill up their cars.
Ample inventories along with relatively stable refinery operations and imports has driven down the spot value of gasoline in Los Angeles at the wholesale level by more than 60 cents since mid-June.
However, that has not translated to similarly lower retail fuel prices for consumers because of peculiarities in California's market. The declines in the state's retail gasoline market over that period of time have averaged less than 14 cents, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
On Thursday, wholesale California gasoline was trading below $1.20 a gallon. The spread between California's wholesale and retail gasoline markets was about $1.50 a gallon the week to July 25, about 40 cents wider than a similar spread in the New York market.
California is one of the most expensive places in the United States to produce gasoline because of the state's unique blending requirements and its relative isolation from the rest of the country, which makes securing crude oil to refine pricier.
Gasoline prices across the country have plunged as crude has also slumped in the past two years, pressured by a global supply glut. On the West Coast, gasoline stocks are at a five-year seasonal high of 29.6 million barrels, according to the EIA. .
The declines in the spot market nationwide have translated to cheaper prices for most U.S. consumers. In Texas and New York, average retail prices are down a respective 41 percent and 39 percent since mid-2014. Californians have enjoyed just a 32 percent dip in that time. 
""We are still seeing retail prices on the downward drop, but they are not dropping as fast as the rest of the country,"" said Michael Green, spokesman for AAA. 
While some of this can be explained by higher taxes and regulatory fees, consumer advocate groups say the bigger problem is the percentage of the retail market controlled by refiners, versus fuel stations not attached to a well-known name. 
""The refiners are essentially pumping up the street price because they have a lock over the retail gasoline market. With the prices the weakest in the country, it can't be those laws. It has to be the pricing behavior,"" said Jamie Court of Consumer Watchdog, a non-profit advocacy group in Santa Monica.
Industry groups, including the West States Petroleum Association, say higher prices are due to state and federal taxes, as well as fees for cap and trade and low carbon fuel standards in California, which can tack on an extra 63 cents a gallon. 
As of April 2015, refiners  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO), Phillips 66 (N:PSX),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX),  Tesoro  Corp (N:TSO) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) controlled about 81 percent of California's retail gasoline market, according to state data. 
Representatives for Tesoro and Chevron said there were a number of factors contributing to the price of gasoline in California, including taxes and local market conditions. 

This year, higher prices drew the attention of California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who in May subpoenaed California refiners as part of a probe into whether they manipulated gasoline prices since 2014. A similar investigation in 2006 found no evidence of manipulation.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2016 01:00PM ET</span>",Myanmar urged to follow shake-up of jade industry with more action on transparency,"By Astrid Zweynert
LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Myanmar's decision to shake up its multi-billion dollar jade business is a ground-breaking opportunity to stop human rights abuses and increase transparency, but more needs to be done to create a more inclusive economy, activists said on Thursday.
The government announced late on Wednesday it will not renew mining permits for jade and other gemstones and that no new permits will be granted until a reformed legal framework is in place, local media reported.
""This is a game changer,"" Juman Kubba, senior campaigner at British-based charity Global Witness, said of the announcement.
The poorly-regulated industry, estimated to be worth $31 billion, almost half of Myanmar's economic output, has been accused of looting the country's mineral wealth with little regard for local people and the environment.
A 2015 Global Witness report said a string of military figures and drug lords secretly controlled and profited from the trade in jade, a green stone mainly used for ornaments and jewelry.
Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi was swept into office in April after winning a landslide election last year, but the military, which ruled Myanmar for nearly half a century until 2011, still holds immense power.
""It suggests Aung San Suu Kyi's government is serious about reform and could help turn the page on the ruthless military rule, cronyism and human rights abuses of the recent past,"" Kubba said.
Deadly accidents in Myanmar's jade mining areas, where small time prospectors and big firms vie for the precious stone, have underscored the sector's lax safety rules and a lack of accountability.
Last November, a massive landslide swept through a mining encampment in Kachin State, which produces some of the world's highest-quality jade, killing more than 100 people.
The jade industry has also been accused of creating social problems since narcotics addiction is rife among gem scavengers who come to the mining areas in hope of finding lumps of jade overlooked by big miners.
The struggle over control of the jade business also remains a major driver of armed conflict between the Myanmar army and the Kachin Independence Organisation.
Matthieu Salomon, Myanmar manager for U.S.-based charity, the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI), said the reported announcement opened the door to reform of the gemstone industry and an end to human rights abuses in the sector.
""It has the opportunity now to set up a framework for a responsible and sustainable business, which forms part of a broader, more inclusive economy for Myanmar,"" said Salomon.
Campaigners urged the government to follow up the announcement with an agreement on how to share the benefits of the jade industry in a transparent way.
The government should also introduce environmental and social measures to protect against landslides and to address local grievances fairly, the NRGI said.
As a participant in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a global standard to promote accountable management of natural resources, Myanmar should publish more data on permit holders, owners of jade companies and detailed sales records, the NRGI said.

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2016 09:00AM ET</span>",Flagging non-oil business dampens outlook for Gulf,"By Andrew Torchia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Economists have cut growth forecasts for most of the rich oil exporting countries of the Gulf as non-oil business activity slows because of government austerity measures, a quarterly Reuters poll found.
Last year, growth in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council began to lose steam as governments reduced spending to limit big budget deficits caused by cheap oil.
This year, those austerity measures - including cuts to energy price subsidies, smaller bonuses for state employees, and higher taxes and fees - are starting to make a major dent in consumers' income, slowing economies further.
Median forecasts for gross domestic product growth this year have been cut for four of the six GCC countries, including the biggest, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the poll of 18 economists showed. Forecasts were cut for next year's growth in five countries.
In Saudi Arabia, the median prediction for GDP growth this year was lowered to 1.2 percent from 1.5 percent in the last Reuters poll, conducted in April. Growth in 2017 is now expected to be 1.7 percent instead of 1.9 percent.
First-quarter Saudi GDP data, released by the government earlier this month, showed the non-oil sector shrank 0.7 percent from a year earlier, its worst performance in at least five years. 
""We think that tighter fiscal policy will continue to weigh on the non-oil sector for the foreseeable future,"" said London-based Capital Economics, which forecasts growth of just 0.3 percent in Saudi Arabia this year, the second-lowest estimate among the 18 analysts.
""At the same time, growth in the oil sector has slowed sharply in recent months and, given the backdrop of ample global oil supplies, we expect it to remain sluggish for the rest of this year.""
In the UAE, the median growth forecast for this year was cut to 2.5 percent from 2.8 percent, and for next year to 2.7 percent from 2.9 percent.
The poll does, however, show predictions for budget deficits in the biggest GCC countries being trimmed - the result of the rebound in oil prices since the start of the year as well as efforts by governments to bring their finances under control.
Economists now expect Saudi Arabia to post a fiscal deficit of 13.5 percent of GDP this year instead of the previous forecast of 15.5 percent; next year's deficit forecast has been lowered to 9.4 percent from 9.7 percent.
However, analysts remain concerned about the outlook for Oman and Bahrain, which they see as the GCC's weakest economies in the face of low oil prices. They have smaller oil and gas resources than their neighbors, and smaller financial reserves.
Oman's fiscal deficit is now forecast at 16.9 percent of GDP this year, instead of the previously projected 16.7 percent, and 11.4 percent next year instead of 10.0 percent. 
Bahrain is now expected to run a deficit of 11.2 percent this year, smaller than the 13.5 percent previously forecast, but the outlook for next year's gap has worsened to 12.0 percent from 10.5 percent.
Because of domestic political opposition, Kuwait has held off on introducing painful reforms to curb state spending such as cuts to energy subsidies, though the government has indicated it intends to take such steps.
Partly because of the delay, Kuwait is now expected to run a fiscal deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP next year instead of the 2.1 percent surplus previously forecast. This year's deficit is projected at 5.3 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied just above three-month lows on Thursday as producers continued to pump more than needed, filling inventories, and economic growth prospects darkened. 
Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was unchanged at $43.47 a barrel by 1215 GMT, after touching $42.88, its lowest since April 20. U.S. light crude (CLc1) was up 20 cents at $42.12.
U.S. government data on Wednesday showed a surprise rise in crude and gasoline inventories. The build added to an already huge global refined product glut just as slowing economic growth dents the demand outlook. [EIA/S]
""U.S. commercial stocks are a good reflection of the oversupplied nature of the global oil market,"" said Tamas Varga, lead oil analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
Oil markets have been dogged by oversupply for the last two years and fell by as much as 70 percent between 2014 and early 2016, when Brent hit the lowest in more than a decade at around $27 per barrel.
Markets have since recovered some ground but oil remains very weak and low refining margins are hurting energy companies.
Energy major Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) reported a more than 70 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday, well below analysts' estimates, as weak oil and gas prices further ate into revenue.
Shell's net income came in at $1 billion in the second quarter, compared with expectations of $2.2 billion and $3.8 billion achieved in the same period last year. 
""Lower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business, particularly in the upstream (operations),"" said Chief Executive Ben van Beurden.
Mihir Kapadia, CEO at wealth management firm Sun Global Investments, said oil was still depressed by concerns over a supply glut and waning demand from leading international markets.
In China, rail freight volume fell 7.5 percent in the first half of 2016 from the same period a year earlier to 1.58 billion tonnes, the country's top economic planner said on Thursday.
Varga at brokerage PVM said record high stocks and oversupply could drive crude prices down into the mid $30 per barrel area before a significant rally.

""The trend is still down and the bears seem to be in control,"" Varga said, adding: ""But we could see an upside correction before driving lower again.""

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2016 01:10AM ET</span>",Bytes and barrels: the origins of oil traders' love of Yahoo,"By Catherine Ngai
NEW YORK (Reuters) - For the oil industry, Yahoo Inc's (O:YHOO) decision this week to sell its core business to  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) for $4.8 billion does not matter all that much. Their world already changed a few months ago, when the company said it would jettison its messaging system that has been the norm for oil traders since the late 1990s.
Back then, Yahoo's technology revolutionized the industry, helping usher in a new era of high-speed communication that changed the way millions of barrels of oil traded daily. For Gene Grabinski, who was trading crude in Chicago for  BP  Plc (L:BP), one of the largest energy companies in the world, it was just the solution needed to stem the endless flood of phone calls as he bought and sold crude in the Midwest and U.S. Gulf. 
And it came about only because he saw his young daughters using messaging services back in the late 1990s.
Come Aug. 5, Yahoo is scuttling its legacy instant messaging service as it seeks to move users to its new Messenger platform, which traders will not use because it fails to meet the industry's compliance standards. The announcement was made in June, prior to the Verizon deal. A company spokeswoman said that Yahoo will focus efforts on its new system, which will deliver better personal communication experiences to its users. 
For almost two decades, tens of thousands in the oil industry relied on the old Yahoo Messenger system, which launched in 1998. At that time, Grabinski was one of just two traders responsible for trading physical, domestic crude for BP, which owns some of the nation's biggest refineries including its facility in Whiting, Indiana, and previously Texas City, Texas. 
But Grabinski had a problem. Every day, his phone ""looked like a Christmas tree,"" he said, with red and green lights blinking as a flood of brokers called and were put on hold while Grabinski tried to gather market prices. 
After seeing his younger daughters, 11 and 7, use online instant messaging to chat with friends, he figured he could use the same system at work at the British major. 
""The 11-year-old was on it and we were actively monitoring it at the time. I was aware of it, but I wasn't really doing it until it came up and I had the potential to use it in the work context,"" said Grabinski, who traded crude for more than a decade at BP starting in the early 1990s. 
EARLY ADOPTERS
It is not clear how Yahoo took the industry by storm, but Grabinski was part of the first wave of oil traders to use Yahoo instant messaging, having opened his account just a year after it was launched. BP was an early adopter of the technology, and several traders said their use of Yahoo helped spur the industry forward, even though Yahoo never actively encouraged the trading community to use its service. 
Grabinski - now a senior crude trader at Italian oil company Eni Trading & Shipping (MI:ENI) - decided on Yahoo because it was newer than AOL's AIM chat, already used by his counterparts in power and natural gas trading. He set up a computer screen between himself and the only other domestic, physical-focused trader at the shop. Using his account, they communicated with the rest of the market.
Slowly, its use became more widespread. Today, everyone from oil traders to hedge fund managers, pipeline schedulers, brokers, refinery buyers and even ship brokers uses the chat system globally. 
""There's a lot of back and forth, asking other people 'What are you seeing? What are you hearing?'"" said Tariq Zahir, an investment manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.
FUTURE CHAT OPTIONS
Oil companies are finding various solutions for communication going forward. Some large players, including  Glencore  Plc (L:GLEN), have adopted Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) chat. ICE said last month that it has more than 10,000 active users for its messaging system, having grown by 15 percent since January.
Other chat systems include Symphony, CME Group Inc's (O:CME) Pivot chat, Bloomberg chat, and Thomson Reuters Messenger. Reuters News is a division of  Thomson Reuters Corp  (TO:TRI).
Some have also discussed more widely used mobile options like WhatsApp, Skype or WeChat, which is popular in Asia. 
Grabinski said the transition to a new system should not be a problem.

""Change is part of it, and you kind of just move on,"" he said. ""I don't think it's going to be that hard. You just type into a little box.""

There is currently a 20.3% chance the FOMC will raise rates at their September meeting along with a 40.4% probability the U.S. central bank will approve a rate hike at a meeting in December, according to the CME Group.
Any rate hikes by the FOMC this year are viewed as bearish for gold, which struggles to compete versus high-yield bearing assets in periods of rising rate environments.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo pleased market reform advocates on Wednesday by bringing home the World Bank's managing director to be finance minister and upset human rights activists by naming a controversial ex-general as security chief.
The surprise appointments of Sri Mulyani Indrawati to head the finance ministry and Wiranto as coordinating minister for politics, law and security were part of a wider-than-expected cabinet reshuffle in which the trade, energy, transport and industry ministers were also replaced.
""I am aware that the challenge keeps changing and it needs quick action from us,"" Widodo told reporters, adding that unemployment and income inequality must be addressed and the cabinet needed to work ""more quickly, more effectively"".
The addition of Indrawati to the president's economic team lifted financial markets, with stocks closing 1 percent higher and the rupiah strengthening 0.4 percent against the dollar.
""Sri Mulyani's appointment is a game-changer because it restores a certain amount of investor confidence and means having a steady hand on the tiller with a solid record as a reformer,"" said Paul Rowland, a Jakarta-based analyst. 
In 2010, Indrawati joined the World Bank after serving as both Indonesia's chief economic minister and finance minister under a previous president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. 
Six years later, she officially returned to Indonesia, wearing a blue batik outfit and a pearl necklace at a handover ceremony at the finance ministry in Jakarta.
""This task is a noble task but it is not light,"" Indrawati said as she accepted her appointment. She listed reducing poverty and inequality, creating job opportunities and restoring business confidence as priorities.
Indrawati had earlier said that she would be looking at both budget and fiscal policies to strengthen Indonesia's economy to withstand ""global tremors and pressures that are very difficult at the moment"".
CRISIS MANAGEMENT
Indrawati, who has a doctorate in economics from the University of Illinois and is not a member of a political party, won praise for successfully managing Indonesia's economy through the 2008 global financial crisis.
""The president wants a dream team to manage economic policies so that we can accelerate (growth). He needs Sri Mulyani,"" said David Sumual, chief economist for Bank Central Asia.
Indonesia's economic growth is expected to improve only slightly in the second quarter from 4.92 percent in the first three months of the year. The finance ministry has forecast full-year GDP growth of about 5.2 percent in 2016, up from 4.79 percent last year. 
Bambang Brodjonegoro, the finance minister Widodo appointed in 2014, has been shifted to head the national development planning agency.
The change in finance ministers comes just after Indonesia launched a tax amnesty it hopes will bring home billions of dollars that Indonesians have parked overseas.
Widodo also surprised many by announcing Wiranto as his new chief security minister, reassigning his close adviser Luhut Pandjaitan to be chief maritime minister.
'VERY OLD GUARD'
Wiranto, army chief when strongman Suharto quit amid protests in 1998, was indicted by a U.N. panel over the bloodshed surrounding East Timor's 1999 independence vote, when about 1,000 people died. The former general has denied any wrongdoing in East Timor. 
""He is part of the very old guard of Suharto's New Order,"" said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia director of Human Rights Watch. ""This is really bad news for human rights.""
Analysts viewed Wiranto's appointment and others as politically motivated, as the president looks to consolidate support from parties keen to join the ruling coalition.
Wiranto controls Hanura, ""a party which has supported Jokowi from the get-go, and one way of seeing this is for the president to secure its continued support"", wrote Wellian Wiranto, economist at OCBC.
The president also welcomed the second-largest political party, Golkar, into the cabinet by appointing Airlangga Hartarto as industry minister.
Golkar, which was in opposition to Widodo when he was elected in 2014, played a key role in getting the president's tax amnesty bill passed this year.
Other major cabinet changes included the re-assignment of Thomas Lembong from trade minister to investment chief.
Arcandra Tahar, an executive at Texas-based offshore engineering firm Petroneering, was appointed energy and mining minister, replacing Sudirman Said.

Companies will now be able to apply for cheaper and more flexible licenses to gain access to 1,261 blocks by Oct. 26, followed by license awards to be issued by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) at a later date.
The hunt for new oil and gas fields in the British part of the North Sea is expected to fall to the lowest in 45 years this year as energy companies have scaled back exploration budgets due to weak oil prices.
Despite being an old basin, Britain's North Sea is estimated to have billions of barrels left for extraction, worth around 200 billion pounds ($262.56 billion) to British government coffers.
The latest licensing round, the 29th, offers access to new areas in the Rockall Trough, the mid-North Sea High and East Shetland, which were subject to a government-funded seismic testing campaign earlier this year.
""We recognise that market conditions are currently very difficult but nevertheless we have a shared goal of making the basin as attractive as possible for exploration,"" Andy Samuel, chief executive of the OGA, said.
The Oil and Gas Authority's contract changes will reduce license rental fees in some cases by up to 90 percent per square kilometer and allow explorers more flexibility in terms of when they can carry out certain work programs.

1169,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2016 02:38PM ET</span>","Special Report: In Venezuela's murky oil industry, the deal that went too far","By Alexandra Ulmer and Girish Gupta
CARACAS/BOGOTA (Reuters) - Even for Venezuela's notoriously opaque economy, it was a sweetheart deal that went too far.
Last August, state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA issued one of its largest tenders in recent years: a multi-billion dollar project in the Orinoco Belt, the world's largest crude reserve. The project was designed to shore up the OPEC country's stagnating oil production and ease an economic crisis.
Then, out of the blue, a tiny Colombian trucking and trading firm with no relevant experience beat global industry leaders to win the contract, worth around $4.5 billion according to one PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] document. Alarm bells rang among PDVSA's foreign partners, which include  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and Rosneft. 
Trenaco, headquartered in Switzerland but largely run out of Colombia, had edged out the world's top service companies — Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Schlumberger and Weatherford — after a series of meetings with top-level PDVSA executives in the six months before the contract was tendered.
Certain it would obtain the huge contract to drill 600 wells, Trenaco began hiring staff and buying equipment months before winning the tender, according to four high-ranking sources from the now-liquidated company, as well as WhatsApp text and audio messages between senior staff reviewed by Reuters.
In an unprecedented rebellion, however, foreign oil firms - which would have had to work with Trenaco as PDVSA's joint venture partners - protested that the company was vastly underqualified and undercapitalized, according to complaint letters sent to PDVSA last year, copies of which were seen by Reuters. Executives at companies that sent the letters showed them to Reuters on the condition that they not be identified as sources.
The international companies also say they feared that getting involved in a massive public project anchored by a small and obscure contractor would expose themselves to regulatory scrutiny back home.
""There were red flags everywhere,"" said one foreign joint venture partner in Caracas.
In one complaint letter reviewed by Reuters, a multinational oil company wrote that Trenaco was ""not qualified technically or financially"" to handle the project.
Despite PDVSA's attempts to persuade partners to accept the deal during joint venture meetings, the foreign companies refused to fold, and the agreement finally collapsed between December and January, according to joint venture partners.
Venezuela's Oil Ministry, Information Ministry and PDVSA did not respond to detailed questions about the Trenaco project.
Among PDVSA's joint venture partners, the United States' Chevron, India's ONGC Videsh, Russia's Rosneft, Spain's Repsol (MC:REP) and Japan's Inpex declined to comment. Japan's Mitsubishi Corp said it ""didn't complain about this deal,"" and had no further comment. Italy's Eni, China's CNPC [CNPET.UL], India's Reliance Industries, India's Oil India Ltd and Venezuela's Suelopetrol did not respond to requests for comment.
DYSFUNCTIONAL ECONOMY 
The doomed Trenaco deal highlights the opacity and dysfunction at PDVSA and in Venezuela's socialist-run economy.
Cash-strapped Venezuela, home to the world's biggest oil reserves, is heaving under a third year of recession, acute food and medicine shortages, triple-digit inflation, and rampant violent crime. Looting and food riots are proliferating, with hungry mobs chanting, ""We want food!"" outside increasingly empty supermarkets. 
Reuters reviewed company documents and interviewed dozens of foreign and local oil executives, current and former PDVSA employees, union leaders, lawyers and politicians. The sources described a culture of corruption that ranges from the trivial - giving a gift to a secretary to land a meeting with a top PDVSA executive – to the systemic, such as funneling kickbacks in return for large contracts.
The U.S. Justice Department has said there is a large, ongoing investigation into bribery at PDVSA. In perhaps the most damning case to date, U.S. authorities in December arrested two Venezuelan oil magnates, Roberto Rincon and Abraham Shiera, alleging they took part in a billion-dollar conspiracy to pay bribes to secure PDVSA contracts. Both men have pleaded guilty. 
Oil accounts for 94 percent of Venezuela's export revenues, and PDVSA is the financial motor of President Nicolas Maduro's government. The company originally criticized the Rincon-Shiera case as part of a wider U.S.-led conspiracy and ""smear campaign"" against socialism.
But in its 2015 financial statement, published this month, PDVSA said an internal probe found it had been the ""victim of fraud,"" referring to the Rincon and Shiera case. 
""PDVSA does not tolerate acts of corruption and will continue investigating and acting with the aim of determining responsibilities,"" the company said.
It listed a series of actions under way to prevent corruption, from new payment procedures and controls to an improved internal ethics code.
Venezuela's economy has ebbed and flowed with the price of oil for a century, and allegations of corruption have been endemic in the industry here.
The country's opposition says the problem has worsened under the populist socialist administrations of Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez. The opposition, now in control of the National Assembly, accuses authorities of stymieing probes into the company.
HIGH-LEVEL MEETINGS
The Trenaco deal began to take shape in early 2015, when a handful of top Trenaco executives took weekly trips by private jet to Caracas and were whisked in a convoy of armored vehicles to a reserved floor in the city's top Marriott hotel, said four senior Trenaco executives in Bogota. The visitors were in Caracas for meetings nearby at PDVSA's headquarters and Trenaco's local office. 
The four executives say a new boss had just taken the helm at Trenaco: Alex Saab, a 44-year-old businessman from Colombia's coastal city of Barranquilla.
Saab, they say, was close to top figures in Maduro's government and had done business with authorities under Chavez. He also had connections with top people at PDVSA, they say.
""Alex Saab had very good relations with the executives at PDVSA,"" said one senior Trenaco executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
In November 2011, Saab signed an agreement on behalf of another of his ventures, a Bogota-based construction company named Fondo Global de Construccion, to build social housing for the Venezuelan government. He appeared on state television signing the deal alongside Chavez and Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos.
Fondo Global's headquarters in Caracas are in the same building as Trenaco's, according to Venezuela's National Registry of Contractors database. 
Saab denies having anything to do with Trenaco. Neither Swiss corporate records nor hundreds of pages of Colombian registry records obtained by Reuters specify who owned Trenaco.
""I am not and have never been an employee or shareholder in the company that you mention and for that reason I have nothing to say,"" Saab told Reuters in an exchange on the Whatsapp message service. He did not respond to a detailed set of follow-up questions.
His lawyer, Colombian attorney Abelardo de la Espriella, said Trenaco executives had approached Saab to ""speak about business"" but Saab had no involvement with the company.
Interviews and other evidence suggest otherwise. Four senior executives of the now-defunct company told Reuters that Saab was in full control of Trenaco. They showed Reuters internal Trenaco correspondence and audio files exchanged via WhatsApp in which Saab participated. Reuters authenticated Saab's number by successfully contacting him on the one used in the WhatsApp conversation.
The four Trenaco executives say the company was run by Saab and two other men: Carlos Gutierrez, the son of a Colombian agricultural baron, and fellow Colombian businessman Alvaro Pulido.
The trio took over the management of the company between 2012 and 2014, when Trenaco was seeking capital, the sources said. Details of the past and current ownership structure are obscure.
Gutierrez did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters was unable to contact Pulido.
MONEY-LAUNDERING PROBE 
Separately, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has been investigating companies owned by Saab and Pulido on suspicion of laundering money from illegal drug trafficking operations, mostly cocaine from Colombia, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters. The status of that investigation is unclear and it is possible that no charges will result.
Saab didn't respond to a question about the DEA inquiry. Reuters was unable to contact Pulido. 
A PDVSA document from last year put the Trenaco project's price tag at some $4.5 billion, though people familiar with the matter said the value was later reduced.
Once the PDVSA tender was published in August, Schlumberger, Halliburton and Weatherford requested an extension to the roughly two weeks allowed for proposals, the PDVSA document shows. Of the three firms, only Schlumberger ultimately submitted an offer, and it was disqualified by the tender committee.
The Schlumberger proposal was shot down because it ""did not accept the conditions and terms of the type of contract,"" the document notes, without elaborating, and because Schlumberger's proposed financing scheme, which appeared to involve paying off dividends that PDVSA owes to the joint ventures, was deemed inadequate. 
At a time of low oil prices, sources at foreign companies said, PDVSA was keen that the contractor finance the project itself, as Trenaco had proposed.
Schlumberger declined to comment. Halliburton said it had ""no additional information to add."" Weatherford did not respond to a request for comment.
Foreign executives said they did not receive an explanation from PDVSA as to why the Trenaco deal fell through. 
Whatever the case, it was a death knell for the Colombian company. Trenaco went into liquidation in March, according to registry documents. The senior Trenaco executives attributed the company's shuttering to the collapse of the PDVSA deal.
Even some government supporters are questioning the unpopular Maduro's management of the key oil sector.
""We're 'Chavistas,' we're revolutionaries, but we're not idiots,"" said Johnny Jimenez, a PDVSA operator and union leader in Maracaibo. He said PDVSA has ignored union requests for worker-led audits. ""Why are they scared of an audit?""
Worried about corruption and inefficiency, foreign companies in Venezuela say they are now vying for more control over the contracts they strike with PDVSA, decreasing the role of Bariven, PDVSA's procurement arm. But because PDVSA has a minimum 60 percent stake in joint ventures, the foreign partners usually cannot take full rein.
Venezuela's resolve to clean up the industry may soon be put to a test. Sources in Caracas and Bogota say PDVSA is now preparing a new tender to drill oil wells in the Orinoco.

In the meantime, Caracas-based foreign executives complain that PDVSA has been signing unexpected contracts with new, inexperienced companies seen as close to the Venezuelan oil giant. In one case, a source at a foreign company said, workers were renting lights from a contractor to illuminate oil fields - during the daytime.

1170,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 26, 2016 01:33PM ET</span>",Gold ticks up in cautious trade with Fed interest rate decision on tap,"Investing.com -- Gold inched up on Tuesday remaining near one-month lows, as policymakers from the Federal Reserve received a final opportunity to digest a mixed batch of economic data ahead of a closely-watched interest rate decision in the middle of the week.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for December delivery traded between $1,321.30 and $1,331.95 an ounce before settling at $1,328.00, up 0.80 or 0.06% on the session. Despite the modest gains, Gold has trended downward in recent sessions sliding more than 2% over the last three weeks since hitting a 28-month high in early-July. Nevertheless, the precious metal is up by 25% year to date and is on pace for one of its strongest years in a decade.
Gold likely gained support at $1,253.70, the low from June 24 and was met with resistance at $1,368.60, the high from July 7.
For a second consecutive session, gold traded in a tight range as cautious investors awaited the Fed's decision on Wednesday afternoon after the close of trading. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to leave its benchmark interest rate at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50% for their fifth straight meeting. On Tuesday, the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool placed the probability of a July rate hike at 2.4%.
Even if the FOMC holds rates steady, analysts will closely parse the monetary policy statement for signals on whether the Committee is leaning towards further tightening when it meets again in late-September. The odds of a September rate hike, according to the CME Group, rose to 25.2% on Tuesday, up from 18.8% a day earlier. By December, the odds rise substantially to 41.7%, in line with previous estimates over the last week.
Any rate hikes by the FOMC this year are viewed as bearish for gold, which struggles to compete versus high-yield bearing assets in periods of rising rate environments.
While the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell slightly in July to 97.3, consumer confidence still remains highly following a massive five-point surge a month earlier. Analysts expected a decline of two points to 96.0. The present situation index also rose 1.7 points to 118.3, representing its strongest monthly gain since last September.
Also, new home sales last month rose by 592,000, topping consensus forecasts of 562,000 and marking the largest increase in three months. On an annual basis, new home purchases in the Midwest and South are both up by more than 20% over the last 12 months. Economists are less optimistic about growth potential in the service-sector after Markit's PMI Services Flash fell 0.4 points from a prior reading of 51.3. Any reading below 50.0 provides signals of contraction in the industry.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was relatively flat on Tuesday hovering at 97.16 in U.S. afternoon trading. The index remains near four-month highs. Over the last few weeks, the dollar has risen sharply against the Japanese Yen and British Pound amid signs of potential easing from both the Bank of Japan and Bank of England. Following the Fed's decision, the BOJ will hold its latest monetary policy meeting on Friday.
Dollar-denominated commodities such as Gold become more expensive for foreign purchasers when the dollar appreciates.
Gold responded somewhat after falling slightly in the overnight, Asian session. On Monday, the International Monetary Fund announced that its board has adopted a new method for calculating global reserve currencies, roughly two months before the yuan is set to join the IMF's Special Drawing Rights basket for the first time ever.
China is the world's largest producer of gold and the second-largest consumer of the precious metal behind India.
Silver for September delivery gained 0.033 or 0.17% to 19.680 an ounce.
Copper for September delivery added 0.007 or 0.32% to 2.224 a pound."

Natural gas for delivery in September on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 3.7 cents, or 1.36%, to trade at $2.675 per million British thermal units by 14:26GMT, or 10:26AM ET. A day earlier, prices lost 3.1 cents, or 1.13%.

Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
This week's storage report slated for release on Thursday is expected to show a build in a range between 19 billion to 31 billion cubic feet for the week ending July 22.
That compares with an increase of 34 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 49 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 52 billion cubic feet.

A day earlier, New York-traded oil lost $1.06, or 2.4%, as concerns over a global supply glut intensified amid signs of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week increased by 14 to 371, the fourth straight weekly rise and the seventh increase in eight weeks.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.
Concerns over a rising gasoline inventories further weighed. Despite being in the midst of the peak summer-driving season in the U.S., gasoline stocks are well above the upper limit of the average range, according to the EIA.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for October delivery dipped 35 cents, or 0.78%, to $44.78 a barrel, after falling to a daily low of $44.14 earlier, the weakest since May 10.
London-traded Brent futures have been under pressure in recent weeks as prospects of increased exports from Libya and Iraq added to concerns that a glut of oil products will cut demand for crude by refiners.

Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, as a rise would lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 97.18 early on Tuesday, not far from a more than four-month high of 97.59, boosted by the diverging monetary policy outlook between the Fed and other global central banks.

1175,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2016 06:21AM ET</span>","Oil falls towards $44, lowest since May, on glut worries","By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil on Tuesday hit its lowest since May, falling towards $44 a barrel, pressured by concerns that a long-awaited rebalancing of the market would be delayed due to excess supply.
Brent crude is still up more than 60 percent from a 12-year low near $27 in January, but the rally has petered out on signs that the supply glut will persist and as economic jitters raised concern about the strength of oil demand.
Global benchmark Brent (LCOc1) was trading at $44.44 a barrel at 1007 GMT, down 28 cents. It fell to $44.28 intraday, the lowest since May 10. U.S. crude (CLc1) was down 43 cents at $42.70, having fallen to its lowest since April earlier.
""Right now, there is not much to be optimistic about,"" said Olivier Jakob, oil analyst at Petromatrix, citing weak refining margins that will probably weigh on crude demand. ""We have to wait a little bit longer for the rebalancing.""
Britain's  BP  (L:BP), the first oil major to report second-quarter results, on Tuesday reported lower-than-expected profit and said its refining margins were the weakest for a second quarter in six years.
Record crude output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, a glut of refined products and signs of more drilling activity in the United States in the face of low oil prices have added to concern about excess supply.
U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a fourth consecutive week. The decline in U.S. output has been key to balancing a market weighed by excess supply for two years.
BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley was upbeat on the oil price outlook, saying the market would start to recover towards the end of the year and into 2017, although excess inventories would take longer to get rid of.
""We do see the market coming into balance, it may already be there,"" he told Reuters. ""There's a lot of stocks. It will take some time to work its way off, 18 months or so.""
Also dampening sentiment, many traders are reducing their bets on rising prices.
Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position - bets on rising prices - in Brent and U.S. crude futures and options by 31 million barrels to 453 million in the week ending on July 19.

1178,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2016 01:30AM ET</span>",Renewed oil weakness sparks demand fears,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices topped $50 a barrel in June, boosting optimism a two-year price rout might end. Six weeks later, the long hoped for recovery has yet to take hold.
Mounting fears that demand has fallen short of expectations as production increases and rig counts rise has analysts believing that any oil price recovery may be a year or more in the future. 
The demand response has been slower than bulls had hoped. U.S. drivers have covered fewer miles than expected this summer, and as they speed toward the Labor Day holiday in September, the overhang of gasoline in storage may put downward pressure on crude and refined product prices. 
""Right now, the only thing that would drive prices higher is robust demand,"" said John Paisie, executive vice president at Stratas Energy Advisors, a Houston-based consultancy. The growth must be across the board, for products including distillates like diesel and jet fuel, as well as gasoline. 
""Demand just can't be made up by one product,"" he said, and demand for diesel has been lagging. 
Instead of seeing $60 a barrel, which would support an increase in production, the demand questions, and ongoing supply concerns, mean oil could fall further. U.S. crude settled at $43.13 on Monday, after earlier hitting a three-month low.
""Demand is growing very moderately,"" said veteran oil economist and independent consultant Phil Verleger. ""There's no real surge to it - call it the great moderation."" 
While gasoline prices have declined, the lower cost at the pump has only a moderate effect on consumer's buying habits, Verleger said. Instead of racing out to fill their tanks, consumers are using the savings to pay down debt, he said. 
The U.S. Department of Energy has trimmed its outlook for gasoline demand growth for the remainder of the year, and now forecasts growth of 160,000 bpd, compared with 220,000 bpd previously.
Gasoline demand data often lags by two months or more, but as figures for the beginning of this year's summer driving season have been released, analysts have trimmed their outlook for 2016 growth. U.S. drivers logged two percent more miles in May than a year earlier, compared with 2.2 percent in April, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
U.S. gasoline demand rose by a modest 0.8 percent in April according to the Department of Energy. May data is due out on Friday.
Experts agree that rebalancing the market will take strengthening demand, as crude from shale formations and deepwater fields has continued to come into production despite lower prices. 
""There's got to be a reckoning that we only have a few weeks left of peak gasoline demand, and then we hit a shoulder season,"" said Michael Cohen, head of energy commodities research at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). In the so-called shoulder season during the autumn, diesel usually drives petroleum demand. 
European diesel demand also may be weaker than expected because of Britain's Brexit vote to leave the European Union, Cohen said. In China, stockpiles have built, which may limit Asian demand growth. 
Without a surge in demand, the market will be unable to use up the gasoline that refiners stockpiled ahead of a summer driving season that shaped up to be more lackluster than expected.

Cohen said he did not expect to see prices fall into the $20s or $30s as in January and February. However, he said, ""our view continues to be slightly lower than where we are.""

The American Petroleum Institue will release its estimates of U.S. crude and refined stockpiles late Tuesday, with the U.S. Department of Energy to release its own more closely-watched figures on Wednesday.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for September delivery rose 0.23% to $43.23 a barrel. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Brent crude for October delivery gained 0.33% to $45.28 a barrel.
Overnight, crude futures fell sharply on Monday, slumping to a fresh three-month low, as continuing fears related to global oversupply and a resurgent U.S. Dollar remained in focus.
In Monday's session, crude fell to its lowest level since late-April as investors responded to further signs of a supply glut on global energy markets.
Over the weekend, analysts from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:NYSE:MS) issued stark warnings on continued oversupply among refined products, as gasoline stocks swelled to a five-year high. It came after gasoline inventories nationwide rose by 0.91 million barrels last week, following a 4.1 million spike in distillate fuel stockpiles over the previous week – representing the largest weekly build in more than five months. The latest trends have exacerbated fears that refineries will slow their pace of oil purchases in the coming weeks, dragging down the cost of crude.
""Crude oil demand is trending below refined product demand for the first time in three years,"" Morgan Stanley wrote. ""Refineries are the true consumer of crude oil, and crude oil demand is ultimately more important than aggregate refined product demand for oil balances. Given the oversupply in the refined product markets, fading refinery margins, and economic run cuts, we expect crude oil demand to deteriorate further over the coming months.""
As a result, the analysts predicted global crude demand will rise modestly by 625,000 barrels per day in 2016, far below forecasts from the International Energy Agency (IEA) of 1.3 million bpd for the year. WTI crude has rallied from a 13-year low of $26.05 a barrel in mid-February in part due to improved signs that a massive supply-demand imbalance had begun to level.
Elsewhere, investors reacted to developments out of Libya on Monday after Petroleum Guard Commander (PFG) Ibrahim Jathran announced that the national oil guard is ready to halt a lengthy blockade of three main ports in the Northern African nation.
The statement came several days after officials at Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) told the United Nations that sending payments to Jathran could set a ""terrible precedent,"" in encouraging militia groups to seize control of oil facilities throughout the country in attempts to receive significant bribery payments from the government. Attempts from Jathran's forces to close numerous pipelines and oil fields around Libya have reportedly cut crude output to less than a quarter of the level from when former president Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for December delivery eased 0.20% to $1,324.70 a troy ounce.
Silver futures for September delivery fell 0.39% to $19.570 a troy ounce, while copper futures for September delivery lost 0.09% to $2.224 a pound.
Overnight, gold inched down in cautious trade on Monday, amid a steady dollar, as market players looked ahead to the start of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting in Washington D.C. for further clues on the path of the U.S. central bank's long-term interest rate outlook.
Commodity traders largely stood pat on Monday, as metal investors prepared for the start of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) two-day July monetary policy meeting on Tuesday morning. While the FOMC is unlikely to make any adjustments to its benchmark Federal Funds Rate, the U.S. central could provide key hints on the timing of its next interest rate hike.
After the Fed's historic rate hike last December, the Committee has responded by leaving the Fed Funds Rate steady at each of its first four meetings in 2016. When the Fed approved a 25 basis point rate hike at the end of last year, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year Zero Interest Rate Policy by ratifying their first interest rate hike in nearly a decade.
Since the FOMC last met in mid-June, a series of major economic and geopolitical developments could compel the Committee to alter its long-term rate forecast. In early-July, minutes from the meeting showed that the participants ""generally thought it was prudent,"" to assess the implications of the Brexit vote on global financial markets before deciding on the timing of further monetary policy tightening. After global markets quickly stabilized following an initial panic, Fed governor Daniel Tarullo said at a forum in Washington that he felt the world's financial system prepared itself ""reasonably well,"" to handle the fallout from the Brexit decision. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has yet to issue a public comment on the impact of the U.K. referendum on the worldwide economy.
The FOMC will also convene for the first time since the release of a relatively optimistic June U.S. employment report, in which the labor market added 287,000 nonfarm payrolls last month. The robust job gains could erase some negative sentiments from a disappointing report in May when the economy added only 38,000 nonfarm jobs – its lowest monthly total in six years.
Any rate hikes by the FOMC this year are viewed as bearish for gold, which struggles to compete versus high-yield bearing assets in periods of raising rate environments.Elsewhere, gold remained supportive as a safe-haven asset after leading G20 officials continued to express widespread concerns on the strength of the global economy at a conference in Chengdu, China over the weekend. Gold is still up by more than 5% since the U.K. voted to leave the European Union on June 24, even as global stock markets linger near nine-month highs.
""We reiterate our determination to use all policy tools – monetary, fiscal and structural – to achieve our goal of strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth,"" the leaders said in a joint statement.

The American Petroleum Institute will release its estimates of U.S. crude and refined stockpiles late Tuesday, with the U.S. Department of Energy to release its own more closely-watched figures on Wednesday.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for September delivery rose 0.09% to $43.17 a barrel.
Overnight, crude futures fell sharply on Monday, slumping to a fresh three-month low, as continuing fears related to global oversupply and a resurgent U.S. Dollar remained in focus.
On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Brent crude for October delivery wavered between $44.98 and $46.27, a barrel, before settling at $45.17, down 0.92 or 1.93% on the day. Both the international and U.S. benchmarks for crude extended losses on Monday after tumbling by approximately 3% last week.
In Monday's session, crude fell to its lowest level since late-April as investors responded to further signs of a supply glut on global energy markets.
Over the weekend, analysts from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:NYSE:MS) issued stark warnings on continued oversupply among refined products, as gasoline stocks swelled to a five-year high. It came after gasoline inventories nationwide rose by 0.91 million barrels last week, following a 4.1 million spike in distillate fuel stockpiles over the previous week – representing the largest weekly build in more than five months. The latest trends have exacerbated fears that refineries will slow their pace of oil purchases in the coming weeks, dragging down the cost of crude.
""Crude oil demand is trending below refined product demand for the first time in three years,"" Morgan Stanley wrote. ""Refineries are the true consumer of crude oil, and crude oil demand is ultimately more important than aggregate refined product demand for oil balances. Given the oversupply in the refined product markets, fading refinery margins, and economic run cuts, we expect crude oil demand to deteriorate further over the coming months.""
As a result, the analysts predicted global crude demand will rise modestly by 625,000 barrels per day in 2016, far below forecasts from the International Energy Agency (IEA) of 1.3 million bpd for the year. WTI crude has rallied from a 13-year low of $26.05 a barrel in mid-February in part due to improved signs that a massive supply-demand imbalance had begun to level.
Elsewhere, investors reacted to developments out of Libya on Monday after Petroleum Guard Commander (PFG) Ibrahim Jathran announced that the national oil guard is ready to halt a lengthy blockade of three main ports in the Northern African nation.
The statement came several days after officials at Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) told the United Nations that sending payments to Jathran could set a ""terrible precedent,"" in encouraging militia groups to seize control of oil facilities throughout the country in attempts to receive significant bribery payments from the government. Attempts from Jathran's forces to close numerous pipelines and oil fields around Libya have reportedly cut crude output to less than a quarter of the level from when former president Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011.

Natural gas for delivery in August on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 3.7 cents, or 1.35%, to trade at $2.706 per million British thermal units by 14:26GMT, or 10:26AM ET.
Prices climbed to a daily peak of $2.785 earlier, the most since July 11, as investors bet a heat wave making its way across the continental U.S. will prompt households to ramp up their air conditioning.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 34 billion cubic feet last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, below forecasts for an increase of 39 billion. That compared with an increase of 64 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 59 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 61 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.277 trillion cubic feet, 14.4% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 17.1% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
Natural gas prices are down nearly 10% since reaching a 13-month high on July 1 amid speculation that July heat won’t prevent stockpiles from reaching a record before the winter.

Crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange sank to a session low of $43.24 a barrel, a level not seen since May 10. It last traded at $43.40 by 13:37GMT, or 9:37AM ET, down 79 cents, or 1.79%.
On Friday, New York-traded oil fell 56 cents, or 1.25%, amid signs of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity.
Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week increased by 14 to 371, the fourth straight weekly rise and the seventh increase in eight weeks.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.
The U.S. benchmark lost $1.93, or 3.83%, last week, after weekly supply data showed a surprising increase in gasoline inventories.
Despite being in the midst of the peak summer-driving season in the U.S., gasoline stocks are well above the upper limit of the average range, according to the EIA.
The report also showed that total U.S. crude oil inventories fell by 2.3 million barrels last week. But at 519.5 million barrels, stockpiles are at historically high levels for this time of year, the EIA said.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for October delivery slumped 75 cents, or 1.63%, to hit $45.34 a barrel, after falling to a daily low of $45.24, the weakest since May 11.
London-traded Brent futures declined $2.23, or 4.03%, last week, as prospects of increased exports from Libya and Iraq added to concerns that a glut of oil products will cut demand for crude by refiners.
According to market experts, elevated stocks of fuel products amid slowing global demand growth is expected to keep prices under pressure in the near-term.
In the week ahead, oil traders will be focusing on U.S. stockpile data on Tuesday and Wednesday for fresh supply-and-demand signals.
Market players will also continue to monitor supply disruptions across the world for further indications on the rebalancing of the market.

The Fed is not expected to take action on interest rates at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, but market players will scrutinize its policy statement for fresh hints on the timing of interest rate hikes over the next several months.

On Friday, prices lost $7.60, or 0.57%, as renewed expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike later this year boosted the U.S. dollar and as investors looked to buy into rising equity markets rather than purchasing safe-haven assets.
The yellow metal declined $4.40, or 0.26%, last week, the second weekly loss in a row.
A recent string of better than expected U.S. data reignited speculation that the Fed will raise interest rates before the end of the year. Interest rate futures are currently pricing in a 45% chance of a rate hike by December, compared with less than 20% a week ago and up from 9% at the start of this month.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose to 97.59 on Friday, a level not seen since March 10. It was last at 97.40 early on Monday, boosted by the diverging monetary policy outlook between the Fed and other global central banks.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
The yellow metal remained supported amid speculation central banks in Europe and Asia will step up monetary stimulus in the next few months to counteract the negative economic shock from the Brexit vote.
Gold is up almost 25% for the year to date, boosted by concerns over global growth and expectations of monetary stimulus. Expectations of monetary stimulus tend to benefit gold, as the metal is seen as a safe store of value and inflation hedge.
Prices surged to a more than two-year high of $1,377.50 earlier in July, as concerns surrounding global growth in wake of Britain’s vote to exit the European Union sent investors flooding into safe haven assets.

1195,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2016 10:36AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Libya oil exports threatened as NOC warns against port deal,"By Ahmad Ghaddar, Libby George and Aidan Lewis
LONDON/TUNIS (Reuters) - Libya's hopes to boost crude exports have been dealt a blow after the head of the National Oil Corporation (NOC) objected to a deal between the government and local guards to reopen key ports. 
In a letter seen by Reuters to U.N. Libya envoy Martin Kobler and a number of oil and diplomatic officials, NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla said it was a mistake to reward Ibrahim Jathran, head of the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG), for a blockade of the oil ports of Ras Lanuf, Es Sider and Zueitina. 
The PFG confirmed on Friday that it would implement an agreement with Libya's U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) to reopen the ports within days, following a visit by Kobler to meet Jathran in Ras Lanuf. 
The terms for ending the blockade have not been made public, but an initial payment for salaries for Jathran's men has been agreed, sources familiar with the matter say. 
In the letter, Sanalla said the deal included payments that would encourage other groups to disrupt oil operations in the hopes of a similar payout. 
""It sets a terrible precedent and will encourage anybody who can muster a militia to shut down a pipeline, an oilfield, or a port, to see what they can extort,"" the letter said.
Sanalla said the NOC would not lift force majeure at export terminals if a payout went through due to the risk that the corporation would face liabilities.
Should any court cases arise internationally for losses stemming from the blockade, ""we, as NOC, are determined not to be attached to these lawsuits"", the letter said. 
The NOC also threatened to withdraw its recognition of the GNA's leadership, or Presidential Council.
Ali al-Hassi, a PFG spokesman, would not confirm whether any money had been received, but said the guards' salaries should be paid now that the force was fulfilling its promise to open the ports. 
OPEC member Libya has been in turmoil for years, with rival governments and complex alliances of armed groups vying for power and a share of the country's significant oil wealth. 
Armed factions, labour disputes and security threats have helped slash oil output to less than a quarter of the 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) seen before the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi.
The blockade by Jathran alone has cost Libya some $100 billion in lost export revenue, according to the letter. 
Sanalla's letter said that due to attacks from Islamic State militants and other damage, exports from the ports would struggle to surpass 100,000 bpd in the near term, a fraction of their designed capacity.
He added that NOC's largest subsidiary, Agoco, would be able to increase production by that amount if it received its operational budget from the government.
""To pay Jathran instead of Agoco makes no sense, politically, economically or legally,"" Sanalla said.
Asked about the terms of any deal with the PFG, Ahmed Maiteeg, a member of the GNA's Presidential Council, said only that he hoped the ports would open soon so Libya could earn badly needed foreign currency.
The country faces a financial crunch because of the collapse in its oil revenues.
""We heard many times from the PFG that they will open the oil ports,"" he told reporters in Tripoli. ""Hopefully this time it will happen.""
Jathran led blockades of the ports starting in 2013 saying he was trying to prevent corruption in oil sales, though others have disputed his motives. 
The PFG has since helped push Islamic State fighters back along the coast to Sirte, where they are surrounded by GNA-aligned forces. 

Kobler's visit to Jathran focussed on continuing security cooperation with the GNA, diplomatic sources said.

1196,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 24, 2016 06:33AM ET</span>",Gold / Silver / Copper futures - weekly outlook: July 25 - 29,"Investing.com - Gold prices declined on Friday, ending the week close to a three-week low as renewed expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike later this year boosted the U.S. dollar and as investors looked to buy into rising equity markets rather than purchasing safe-haven assets.
Gold for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange shed $7.60, or 0.57%, to settle at $1,323.40 a troy ounce by close of trade. A day earlier, gold slumped to $1,310.70, a level not seen since June 29.
For the week, gold dipped $4.40, or 0.26%, the second weekly loss in a row.
A recent string of better than expected U.S. data reignited speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year. Interest rate futures are currently pricing in a 45% chance of a rate hike by December, compared with less than 20% a week ago and up from 9% at the start of this month.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose to a four-month high of 97.59 on Friday. It closed at 97.41, up 0.5% for the day and 1% higher on the week, boosted by the diverging monetary policy outlook between the Fed and other global central banks.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
The yellow metal remained supported amid speculation central banks in Europe and Asia will step up monetary stimulus in the next few months to counteract the negative economic shock from the Brexit vote.
Gold is up almost 25% for the year to date, boosted by concerns over global growth and expectations of monetary stimulus. Expectations of monetary stimulus tend to benefit gold, as the metal is seen as a safe store of value and inflation hedge.
Prices surged to a more than two-year high of $1,377.50 earlier in July, as concerns surrounding global growth in wake of Britain’s vote to exit the European Union sent investors flooding into safe haven assets.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for September delivery shed 12.6 cents, or 0.64%, on Friday to settle at $19.68 a troy ounce. On the week, silver futures slumped 36.8 cents, or 2.33%, the first weekly loss in eight weeks.
Elsewhere in metals trading, copper for September delivery dipped 2.3 cents, or 1.02%, on Friday to end at $2.235 a pound. For the week, New York-traded copper prices eased up 0.2 cents, or 0.13%.
In the week ahead, investors will be looking to Wednesday’s highly-anticipated Federal Reserve policy statement for fresh guidance on the pace of interest rate hikes over the next several months.
Elsewhere, market participants will be awaiting a monetary policy announcement from the Bank of Japan on Friday, amid growing expectations for further stimulus.
Traders will also be looking ahead to data on U.S., U.K. and European second quarter gross domestic product for fresh indications on the health of the global economy in wake of Britain's shock vote last month to exit the European Union.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2016 04:00PM ET</span>",Canadian authorities seek to contain oil spill moving down river,"(Reuters) - Authorities are building a new containment boom to fight an oil spill in a major western Canadian river, officials said on Saturday, after the spill breached a previous barrier and threatened the drinking water of several communities along the coast.
The city of North Battleford, which draws its drinking water in part from the North Saskatchewan River, shut its supply intake on Friday and switched to using ground water, provincial officials said in a telephone conference with reporters.
Some 1,572 barrels of heavy oil and diluent leaked from Husky Energy Inc's Saskatchewan Gathering System pipeline on Thursday, flowing into the river. The company shut the line, stopping the leak, and has been working to contain the spill.
The Calgary-based Husky did not immediately respond to a request for further comment, but previously said it was expecting ""minimal impact.""
It is not immediately clear what caused the spill.
Water levels rose on Friday, pushing debris into the booms upstream from North Battleford, a city of 14,000, and the oil continued to moved downward.
The province of Saskatchewan has started building a new boom near the community of Maymont, about 50 km (31 miles) downstream from North Battleford, though it is not sure when the oil spill will reach it, Wes Kotyk, executive director of environment protection with the province of Saskatchewan, told reporters.
Water security is a concern as North Battleford's treatment capabilities for groundwater are limited, and water usage in summer is high, said Sam Ferris, Saskatchewan's executive director of environmental and municipal management services.
He said authorities are working on plans to deal with the issue for communities farther down the river, including several small communities and Prince Albert, a city with 35,000 people.
Kotyk said the federal environment agency is working on a ""trajectory model"" to determine the exact size and rate of movement of the oil plume, which officials don't yet know.
He said authorities are making plans for cleanup of the shoreline, parts of which had been polluted as the oil made its way downstream.
Bert West, in charge of petroleum and natural gas in Saskatchewan, said it is too early to talk about cleanup costs or how the incident could potentially affect the economy.
""We haven't have a spill like this, so we're not sure,"" he said. ""As far as costs go, we're not worried about that at this point.""

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for September delivery traded between $43.74 and $44.95 a barrel before closing at $44.23, down 0.52 or 1.16% on the session. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for September delivery wavered between $45.17 and $46.50 a barrel, before settling at $45.73, down 0.46 or 1.00% on the day. Both WTI and Brent futures fell by approximately 3% on the week.
Crude futures rallied somewhat in the final hour of Friday's session after reports surfaced of a mass shooting at a shopping mall in Munich. The shooting comes roughly a week after a terrorist deliberately drove a truck into a Bastille Day crowd in Nice, killing 84 people and injuring at least 300 others. Oil prices typically move higher in periods of heightened geopolitical instability.
Meanwhile, the spread between the international and U.S. benchmarks of crude stood at $1.50, up slightly from Thursday's level of $1.45 at the close of trading.
On Friday afternoon, oil services company Baker Hughes said the number of active oil rigs throughout the U.S. rose by 14 to 371, increasing for the fourth consecutive week and moving higher for the seventh time over the last eight weeks. The total rig count jumped by 15 to 462, as U.S. gas rigs fell by one to 91. During the first week of June, the overall count moved higher for the first time in 2016 ending a 41-week drought.
A rising rig count provides lagging indications that producers could be ready to return online, even as oil prices remain sharply below their peak of $115 a barrel two summers ago. Despite the recent downturn, U.S. crude prices have still surged approximately 60% since touching down to 13-year lows at $26.05 a barrel on February 11. 
It comes as high-cost domestic shale producers have shown surprising resilience in removing inefficient rigs in an attempt to regain market share from OPEC competitors such as Saudi Arabia and Iran. Global oil prices have fallen precipitously since OPEC rattled markets in November, 2014, by abandoning a strategy for price stabilization in favor of capturing a larger share of the global marketplace. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged more than 0.50% to an intraday high of 97.59, reaching its highest level since March 10.

Gold closed Friday's session near three-week lows, ending the week with its second consecutive weekly decline. Although Gold has retreated from 28-month highs from earlier in July, the precious metal is still up by nearly 25% year-to-date.
Gold likely gained support at $1,253.70, the low from June 24 and was met with resistance at $1,368.60, the high from July 7.
The U.S. Dollar continued its upward climb on Friday, amid broad signals that conditions in the struggling manufacturing sector have bottomed. On Friday, the flash reading for July's PMI Manufacturing Index surged more than a full point to 52.9, soaring to its highest level in nine months. The unexpected rise was driven by a flood of new orders, as new business volume expanded at the fastest pace since October, 2015. At the same time, the dollar rose considerably against the British Pound after Markit reported that the British economy shrank at its quickest pace since early-2009, as economists digested the release of the first batch of Post-Brexit data since last month's surprising decision.
Markit's U.K. Flash Composite PMI index for July fell 4.5 points to 47.7, exacerbating fears of an imminent recession throughout Britain. Activity in the Services industry also fell considerably, as the U.K. Services PMI Index plunged 4.9 points to 47.4 from its level in June. As a result, GBP/USD slid more than 1% to an intraday low of 1.3079, falling back to near 1-week lows. Since voters in the U.K. spooked markets with their decision to leave the European Union on June 24, the Pound Sterling has tumbled nearly 12% against the Dollar.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged more than 0.50% to an intraday high of 97.59, reaching its highest level since March 10. Dollar-denominated commodities such as gold become more expensive for foreign investors when the dollar appreciates. The Dollar is virtually flat since mid-December when the Federal Reserve ended a seven-year zero interest rate policy by approving its first rate hike in nearly a decade.
Investors await next week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) July meeting for further indications on the timing of the U.S. central bank's next rate hike. On Friday, Fed Future Rates from the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool placed the odds of a single rate hike in 2016 at just under 50%. Any rate hikes by the FOMC this year are viewed as bearish for gold, which struggles to compete versus high-yield bearing assets in periods of raising rate environments.

1202,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2016 03:40AM ET</span>",Philippines' oil still in troubled waters after South China Sea ruling,"By Enrico Dela Cruz
MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines, eager to resume development of vital oil and gas reserves off its coast, will likely need to reach an accord with a Chinese government infuriated by last week's ruling that granted Manila a big victory in the South China Sea.
The Philippines relies overwhelmingly on imports to fuel its fast-growing economy. That reliance will grow further in a few years when the main source of domestic natural gas runs out, so the clock is ticking for it to develop offshore fields that China shows no sign of loosening its grip on.
Beijing has refused to recognize the ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration that granted the Philippines sovereign rights to access offshore oil and gas fields, including the Reed Bank, a shallow tablemount some 85 nautical miles off its coast.
And as long as things stay that way, the Philippines will have a hard time finding much-needed foreign expertise willing to risk upsetting China, officials and experts say.
According to U.S. oilfield services company Weatherford, one concession - SC 72 - contains 2.6-8.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. That would be as much as triple the amount discovered at the Malampaya project, an offshore field that powers 40 percent of the main island of Luzon, home to the capital Manila.
Malampaya, which was developed by Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and began operations in 2001, is approaching the end of its productive life. Its only viable replacements are in waters that China insists it will not cede.
""Malampaya is going to run out of gas in 10 years so there is urgency for us to develop the Reed Bank,"" said Antonio Carpio, a supreme court associate justice.
Carpio was part of the legal team that made the case in The Hague and said a big factor in the Philippines' decision to pursue arbitration in 2013 was China's obstructions around Reed Bank.
""Every time we send a survey ship there, Chinese coastguard vessels harass our survey ships,"" he told news channel ANC. ""That's why we had to do something.""
DEFERRED BY DISPUTES
The U.S. Energy Information Administration believes that beneath the South China Sea could be 11 billion barrels of oil, more than Mexico's reserves, and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Most foreign firms with capital and technology needed to develop those reserves, however, don't want to risk being caught up in spats over jurisdiction and have avoided concessions offered in disputed waters.
Manila's state-run Philex Petroleum (PS:PXP) has the controlling stakes in two stalled concessions, the 880,000-hectare SC-72 at the Reed Bank and the 616,000-hectare SC-75 off the island of Palawan.
The court verdict on July 12 sparked a surge in energy stocks the next day, with Philex shares up as much as 21 percent.
Philex says it is seeking a meeting with Philippine energy officials regarding the potential to lift a suspension order on drilling activities in the Reed Bank, in place since December 2014.
""It's a matter of national importance. We don't want to move on our own without guidance from the government,"" Philex Chairman Manuel Pangilinan told reporters.
""We will need a partner ... no local company has the expertise that we need.""
Department of Energy spokesman Felix William Fuentebella said there were no immediate plans to lift the suspension as the department awaited guidance from new President Rodrigo Duterte.
""The moratorium stays. We are exploring ways to resolve the conflict peacefully and we follow the lead of the President,"" he said.
Manila and Beijing have both expressed a desire to resume talks, but the Philippines says it could not accept China's pre-condition of not discussing the ruling.
CONCESSION TO SHARE?
Without an agreement between Manila and Beijing, finding development partners would be difficult, said Andrew Harwood, a Southeast Asia upstream analyst at Wood Mackenzie.
""There has to be some softening of Beijing's stance before any companies would be willing to go and drill in any of the disputed areas,"" he said.
China has involved energy businesses in diplomatic disputes previously.
In May 2014, state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) moved its Haiyang Shiyou 981 oil rig into Vietnam's Exclusive Economic Zone, guarded with a flotilla of coastguard ships. In a tense standoff, Vietnam protested vehemently and sent ships to try to disrupt operations.
Surveying on the disputed Reed Bank concessions began in 2003 under a Joint Marine Seismic Undertaking (JMSU) between Philippine state-owned PNOC Exploration Corp, CNOOC and state-owned PetroVietnam. Manila did not extend the agreement when it lapsed in 2008 after criticism from within the Philippines that the deal compromised its sovereignty.
The pact also caused a diplomatic upset in Southeast Asia as it was seen as undermining regional solidarity against an assertive China.
But some Filipino oil executives think teaming up again with CNOOC could solve problems on both the diplomatic and logistical fronts.
Pangilinan of Philex said he would not close the door on a China JV, while Philex President Daniel Stephen Carlos said a ""farm-in"" type deal was also being looked at.
Rufino Bomasang, a former Philippines energy ministry undersecretary and current executive chairman of Otto Energy Investments, an oil and gas exploration and production company, said restarting the JMSU with CNOOC should be considered.
""It is something worthwhile resuming,"" Bomasang told Reuters. ""If there's good faith on both sides, why not? And I hope so.""
CNOOC did not respond to a request for comment.
China's Foreign Ministry did not directly answer a question submitted by Reuters about whether the government would permit a Chinese firm to join up with Philex, but said in a faxed statement that Reed Bank was Chinese territory.
China wants to resolve the South China Sea issue through talks and is willing to set aside disputes for joint development before a resolution is reached, the ministry added.

""China is willing to have consultations and dialogue with the Philippines about this,"" it said, without elaborating.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Crude oil futures eased on Friday, extending big falls in the previous session as investors reassessed U.S. data underlining the glut in petroleum, while Iraqi crude exports are also on the rise.
The global oversupply of oil has been easing but with huge amounts of crude being held in tanks and tankers on land and water, the rebalancing has taken longer than many expected.
""The market is getting a little bit nervous about the medium term. The inroads into global stockpiles of oil are not as great as anticipated,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at Sydney's CMC Markets.
Brent crude fell 11 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $46.09 a barrel as of 0700 GMT after closing 2.1 percent lower in the previous session. Brent is on track for a decline of more than 3 percent for the week.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dropped 27 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $44.48 a barrel after ending the previous session down 2.2 percent.
A weaker U.S. dollar helped support prices, which scraped into positive territory earlier in the session.
The dollar index slipped against a basket of currencies on Friday. A weaker greenback it makes dollar-traded commodities, including oil, cheaper for holders of other currencies.
While U.S. production has been falling, crude inventories are at a historically high of 519.5 million barrels for this time of year, the EIA said earlier this week.
Total U.S. crude and oil product stocks rose 2.62 million barrels to an all-time high of 2.08 billion barrels as gasoline stocks posted a surprise build of 911,000 barrels during summer driving season.
""There is so much oil in storage that it will take months to truly feel the erosion of the overhang,"" Energy Aspects said in a note.
In the Middle East, Iraq's oil exports are set to rise in July, according to loading data and an industry source, putting supply growth from OPEC's second-largest producer back on track after two months of declines.
Exports from southern Iraq in the first 21 days of July have averaged 3.28 million barrels per day (bpd), according to loading data tracked by Reuters and an industry source. That would be up from 3.18 million bpd in June.
The rise came as a report by BMI Research on Friday said fundamentals in the Asian diesel market remain weak, as demand for the fuel continues to wane in key Asian markets. 

""Tight margins, ample supplies and brimming stockpiles at key diesel storage hubs suggest that a pullback in diesel output is imminent,"" the report said.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for August delivery declined 0.37% to $1,326.05.
The August contract ended Thursday’s session 0.89% higher at $1,331.00 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,312.80, Thursday’s low and resistance at $1,341.40, the high from July 14.
Sentiment strengthened mildly after ECB President Mario Draghi said on Thursday that European markets weathered the post-Brexit volatility with “encouraging resilience”, but reiterated that the central bank is ready to act by using all the instruments available under its mandate if necessary.
The comments came after the central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record-low 0.0% in a widely expected move.
Separately, the U.S. dollar remained supported after positive U.S. data on Thursday boosted optimism over the strength of the economy.
Data showed that U.S. existing home sales increased unexpectedly by 1.1% in June to 5.57 million units, while a separate report showed that U.S. jobless claims fell unexpectedly by 1,000 to 253,000 last week.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 96.96, not far from Wednesday’s four-month highs of 97.37.
The upbeat data added to expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in the near future.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. However, a gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.

1205,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2016 01:20AM ET</span>",Traders eye export markets as U.S. crude futures pummeled,"By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - A ballooning spread between the price of U.S. and European oil, coupled with lower shipping costs, has traders scrambling to take advantage of what may be a brief window of opportunity to ship crude to higher priced markets. 
The premium for Brent futures relative to U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose above $1.50 barrel on Thursday, its largest level since April, up 50 cents from the start of the week . 
European futures have mostly traded at less than a dollar premium to the U.S. benchmark for the past two months, effectively closing off the opportunity to move oil across the Atlantic profitably. Traders typically move crude to markets where it can fetch a higher price, an economic structure known as arbitrage. 
With the closely watched spread now widening, ship brokers said the appetite for Aframax tankers, which can carry around 700,000 barrels of product, has picked up, the first sign that traders are positioning themselves for exports. 
The United States lifted its decades-old ban on exporting crude in December, but since then opportunities to ship out U.S. crude have been limited by poor economics and a global glut in oil. Brent futures only briefly traded close to a $3 a barrel premium to WTI this year, whereas last year the spread hit a high of nearly $13 a barrel. 
U.S. crude futures have lately faced increasingly bearish pressure, with WTI futures (CLc1) down about 10 percent since the end of June; it settled at $44.75 a barrel on Thursday. 
The opportunity to move crude as a result of the opening of this spread may be limited.
""Over the longer term we expect a stable and low WTI-Brent spread as U.S. domestic inventories return to historical levels. We may see an uptick in arbitrage-driven trading until that happens,"" said David St. Amand, owner of Navigistics Consulting. 
Swiss commodities firm Vitol  was said to have put two Aframax vessels which can carry crude, the Seagrace and Primorsky Prospect, on ""subs"" this week, which is a way to tentatively book a vessel for loading, according to three sources.
Both ships are fixed to move from U.S. Gulf Coast to Europe at between 55 to 60 percent of the Worldscale shipping rate, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data. That translates into roughly $750,000 to $800,000 for the voyage, which is down from around $1.5 million when demand is more robust, shipping brokers said. 
One ship broker, who was not authorized to speak to media, said folks ""are jockeying for position,"" as they try to ""export crude to whomever will take it."" 
PIPELINE DISCOUNTS
Discounts for pipeline space traded on the secondary market may also make exports more viable because they reduce the cost of shipping oil to ports on the Gulf Coast. 
Traders on Thursday reported seeing discounted rates on Magellan Midstream Partners' and Plains All American Pipeline's 300,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) BridgeTex, which connects the Permian Basin to the U.S. Gulf Coast, and TransCanada Corp's 700,000-bpd MarketLink system, which moves crude from Cushing to the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
The increased interest in exporting helped support cash prices this week, traders said, with WTI at Midland, Texas,  jumping 55 cents to trade at a 15-cent-per-barrel premium to U.S. futures. WTI at Magellan East Houston jumped 50 cents a barrel this week, trading at a $1.35 a barrel premium to the U.S. benchmark.
To be sure, several sources said the economics were still too tight for their shops to make exports work. They noted the current spread favored those with committed space on certain pipelines, access to ships, or refining and storage assets.

""Players with a system - pipe space, tankers on time charter or a refinery short will have better econs than those looking to do spot business,"" said Dominic Haywood, an analyst with Energy Aspects.

""If warranted to achieve its objective, the Governing Council will act by using all instruments available within its mandate,"" Draghi said. ""I would stress readiness, willingness (and the) ability to do so.""
Draghi also downplayed forecasts that the U.K.'s departure could shave off as much as 0.5% in annual GDP growth throughout the euro area, noting that the duration and outcome of negotiations between the parties could take years to settle.

The Governing Council's latest rate decision came days before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets in Washington next week for its two-day July meeting. As the U.S. labor and housing markets have shown signs of improvement in recent weeks, FOMC participants have appeared split on the timing of its next interest rate hike. The Federal Reserve has held its benchmark interest rate steady at each of its first four meetings this year since raising short-term rates 25 basis points last December.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for gold, which struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate periods.

MELBOURNE/MILAN/LONDON - (Reuters) - Forced to shut its $54 billion Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant twice in its first five months,  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) now faces calls from union officials for a probe into the site's safety.
Chevron denies there have been any safety breaches at the plant but is under pressure to resolve problems that have limited exports to just two cargoes since starting operations in March.
The Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union (AMWU) has told Reuters it has formally requested access to the site.
""The AMWU has concerns about safety at Gorgon,"" Steve McCartney, West Australian secretary of the AMWU, told Reuters via email.
A failed weld on a valve casing called a trunnion caused the gas leak that forced the plant to close on July 1, he said.
""The AMWU wants to know why it failed, and what checks were carried out to ensure it met Australian standards,"" McCartney said.
Chevron called the leak ""minor"", although it did evacuate some workers. On Wednesday the company said it expected to resume production shortly.
""Chevron Australia is in discussions with the AMWU to visit the site as part of usual union engagement with its members,"" a spokeswoman said, adding that there had been no safety breaches at the plant.
Reuters could not independently confirm whether the issues at the plant pose any risk to worker safety.
MISTAKES
Chevron, which is counting on Gorgon to help it become an LNG leader in Asia, reported its first shutdown in April and was forced to shut again following a gas leak on July 1.
In interviews with Reuters, site workers and industry sources familiar with operations at Gorgon said mistakes led to the first shutdown.
According to information provided by one engineer at the plant, liquid propane in the refrigerant circuit flooded into a section of pipeline meant to handle gases only.
Metal debris inside the piping was propelled along at speed, damaging equipment and producing ""very loud clunking noises"" which prompted operators to initiate emergency shutdown procedures, according to one worker and corroborated by AMWU's McCartney.
Chevron said the problem occurred in the propane refrigerant circuit where natural gas is cooled into a liquid but declined to provide further details.
LAGGING RIVALS
The shutdowns have cost Gorgon more than $200 million in lost output, excluding repairs and other expenditures, one industry consultant estimated, basing the figure on an export schedule of around one cargo per week.
The outages have also contributed to a jump in global LNG spot prices, which are up by around 40 percent since April. [LNG-AS]
Two industry sources said Chevron ignored advice from project partners Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) to go slow with the launch of Gorgon.
""We do not comment on industry rumor or speculation,"" Chevron said. Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon also declined to comment.
""Gorgon's teething issues mirror the ongoing problems at Angola LNG and put the spotlight on Chevron,"" said Rystad Energy analyst Readul Islam regarding Chevron's ability to deliver LNG plants.
Chevron and partners  BP  (LON:BP),  ENI  (MI:ENI) and Total has just finished work on its LNG plant in Angola following a two-year shutdown to fix design flaws.
Operations tentatively resumed at the plant just last month.
Meanwhile, rivals have moved forward, with Exxon Mobil launching its Papua New Guinea (PNG LNG) liquefaction plant on time and on budget in 2014, when Gorgon was first due to start operations.
""The relatively niggle-free ramp-up of Gladstone LNG (in Australia) as well as the PNG LNG trains over the past two years could lead to questions being asked of Gorgon's onshore (start-up) team,"" said Rystad's Islam, but he added that Gorgon's greater complexity and size arguably make it a bigger challenge.
Industry sources and analysts continue to project start-up delays at subsequent phases of Gorgon due partly to the latest hiatus.
Chevron denies this. It says that construction on Gorgon production lines two and three, which will boost its export capacity to 15.6 million tonnes a year in 2017, are unaffected.
Peter Coleman, chief executive of Woodside Petroleum which is partnered with Chevron in developing the $33 billion Wheatstone LNG project in Australia, said his company was taking a more hands-on role in development as Chevron is ""having to direct resources elsewhere"".
But he added he had no concerns about Chevron as a project operator.
""They've got a lot on their plate and so many hands help, and that's where we are at the moment,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices moved slightly higher on Thursday after the U.S. Energy Department reported a ninth consecutive weekly drawdown of crude stocks, although an overall build in oil inventories capped gains.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery (CLc1), the new front-month contract from Thursday, was up 15 cents at $45.90 a barrel at 0800 GMT. The August contract expired on Wednesday after rising 29 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $44.94 a barrel.
Brent crude's front-month contract (LCOc1) was up 15 cents at $47.32 a barrel.
U.S. crude inventories  fell 2.3 million barrels in the week ending July 15, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed. [EIA/S] 
But at 519.5 million barrels, inventories are at historically high levels for this time of year, the EIA said.
""This week's report was moderately bullish for crude, which drew slightly more than expected,"" said Michael Wittner, oil analyst at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
Gasoline stocks  rose 911,000 barrels, against a forecast for unchanged, and are well above the upper limit of the average range, the EIA said. 
July is the peak of summer when Americans traditionally take to the road, driving up gasoline demand.
A glut of refined products has worsened an already-grim outlook for U.S. crude oil for the rest of the year and the first half of 2017, traders warned this week, as the spread between near-term and future delivery prices reached its widest in five months.
A glut in oil products threatens to spill back into oil prices, depressing crude, BMI Research said in a note: ""An abundance of fuels threatens to dampen crude demand.""
Overall, U.S. oil inventories are at a record high, reflecting a very well supplied global market.
That should undermine prices, said Tamas Varga, oil analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates:

""There is lots of oil around,"" said Varga. ""The market strength is not sustainable.""

However, elevated stocks of fuel products amid slowing demand growth is expected to keep prices under pressure.
Crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 18 cents, or 0.39%, to trade at $45.93 a barrel by 07:53GMT, or 3:53AM ET.
A day earlier, New York-traded oil rose 30 cents, or 0.66%, after weekly U.S. supply data showed a larger than expected fall in crude stockpiles and a surprising increase in gasoline inventories.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said that crude oil inventories fell by 2.3 million barrels last week. But at 519.5 million barrels, inventories are at historically high levels for this time of year, the EIA said.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 0.9 million barrels, disappointing expectations for a decline of 0.8 million barrels. Gasoline stocks are also well above the upper limit of the average range, according to the EIA.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for September delivery inched up 21 cents, or 0.45%, to $47.38 a barrel, after gaining 51 cents, or 1.09%, on Wednesday, amid a broad recovery in risk appetite.

1218,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 21, 2016 02:49AM ET</span>",Gold slumps to 3-week low on Fed rate hike bets; ECB ahead,"Investing.com - Gold prices added to overnight losses in European trade on Thursday, falling to a new three-week low amid renewed expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike later this year.
Gold for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell to a session low of $1,310.70 a troy ounce, a level not seen since June 24. It was last at $1,317.05 by 06:49GMT, or 2:49AM ET, down $2.25, or 0.17%.
A day earlier, prices lost $13.00, or 0.98%, as investors looked to buy into rising equity markets rather than purchasing safe-haven assets.
A recent string of upbeat economic reports, including June housing starts, retail sales, ISM manufacturing and employment were all better than expected, suggesting that economic growth regained speed in the second quarter.
The bullish data could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates much sooner than previously expected. Interest rate futures are currently pricing in a 19% chance of a rate hike by September. December odds were at 51%, compared with less than 20% a week ago and up from 9% at the start of this month.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose to a four-month high of 97.37 on Wednesday, boosted by Fed rate hike speculation. It traded at 97.00 early Thursday, up from levels of around 96.00 just a week ago.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
The yellow metal remained supported amid speculation central banks around the world will step up monetary stimulus in the next few months to counteract the negative economic shock from the Brexit vote.
Market players looked ahead to the outcome of Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting. The consensus is that the ECB will leave interest rates on hold, while President Mario Draghi is expected to hint at further stimulus as soon as September to offset the hit to the economy from Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
Traders are also focusing on whether the Bank of Japan will expand its monetary stimulus at its policy meeting later this month. The yen  has been pressured by expectations that a double-bazooka of fiscal and monetary easing was on the cards in the weeks ahead.
Investors are also wagering on a rate cut from the Bank of England in August.
The precious metal is up almost 25% for the year to date, boosted by concerns over global growth and expectations of monetary stimulus.

1219,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2016 01:10AM ET</span>",More pain seen for U.S. crude as product glut adds to gloom,"By Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A glut of refined products has worsened the already-grim outlook for U.S. crude oil for the rest of the year and the first half of 2017, traders warned this week, as the spread between near-term and future delivery prices reached its widest in five months.
A stubborn, massive supply overhang punished crude over the winter as U.S. oil futures hit 12-year lows in February. As supply outages and production cuts increased, crude rallied and spreads tightened significantly in May.
But the unusually large amount of gasoline and oil in storage, combined with expectations of a ramp-up in crude production, has made traders more bearish on the price outlook for late 2016 and early 2017. 
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures for delivery in September traded at a discount of as much as $2.23 to those for delivery in December on Wednesday, the biggest this year.
Turnover in that spread soared, touching a record high of more than 19,000 contracts, or about 19 million barrels of oil. 
December spreads, which are the most actively traded, have also blown out in the past month. The discount of the WTI December 2016 contract to December 2017 widened to $4.11 last week. On Wednesday it traded as wide as $3.92 with over 15,000 lots traded.
In May that spread had narrowed to just 50 cents, the tightest since November 2014.
The market is concerned that gasoline supply will not clear up in the second half of 2016, causing refinery run cuts and another wave of excess crude, a North Carolina-based trader said.
These are, however, short-term concerns, leading to more pressure on the front part of the curve, he said.
Crude inventories have fallen for nine straight weeks, but at 519.5 million barrels, stockpiles are at historically high levels for this time of year, the U.S. Energy Department said. 
""The market may be adjusting to the reality that crude stocks are not only not going to draw rapidly, but also that as we move into refinery maintenance season, that could exacerbate the problem,"" said Andrew Lebow, senior partner at Commodity Research Group in Darien, Connecticut.
As of last week, some 241 million barrels of gasoline were sitting in storage tanks, the most in at least a quarter of a century for this time of the year - the height of the U.S. driving season.
Some refiners have already cut output as gasoline margins sink. 
Meanwhile, U.S. oil drillers have added a net 32 oil rigs since early June, the biggest increase during a nine-week period since last summer. 
Further out the curve, the discount between futures for delivery in June 2017 to those in December 2017 last week reached its widest since February, at $1.66. It was close to those levels on Wednesday, trading at a discount of as much as $1.37. 
To be sure, producer hedging has also played a part in keeping the 2017 contracts and spreads under pressure, traders and brokers said. Last week, Laredo Petroleum said it hedged about 2 million barrels oil for 2017 early in July.
Companies have capitulated to a sustained period of weak prices and are looking to lock in profits now, for fear of another crash. After rising to $51 a barrel in early June, on Wednesday U.S. crude settled at $44.94 a barrel. [O/R]

One London-based broker said it is ""scary"" when producers lock in output even with prices at current low levels, adding that it was an indication that the oversupply would continue.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2016 09:47PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump considering fracking mogul Harold Hamm as energy secretary - sources,"By Michelle Conlin
CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is considering nominating Oklahoma oil and gas mogul Harold Hamm as energy secretary if elected to the White House on Nov. 8, according to four sources close to Trump's campaign.
The chief executive of Continental Resources (N:CLR) would be the first U.S. energy secretary drawn directly from the oil and gas industry since the cabinet position was created in 1977, a move that would jolt environmental advocates but bolster Trump's pro-drilling energy platform. 
Dan Eberhart, an oil investor and Republican financier, said he had been told by officials in Trump's campaign that Hamm, who has been an informal advisor to Trump on energy policy since at least May, was ""the leading contender"" for the position. 
Eberhart said he had discussed the possible appointment with top donors at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week, where Trump was formally nominated as the party's candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election.
Three other sources close to the Trump campaign confirmed Trump was considering Hamm for the post. One of the sources said he first heard that Hamm was a contender from Trump officials on Sunday. None of the sources was aware of who else Trump may be considering for the job.
Representatives for Trump and Hamm did not respond to a request for comment. 
Addressing the convention on Wednesday night, Hamm called for expanded drilling and said too much environmental regulation threatened to limit U.S. oil production and increase the country's dependence on Middle Eastern oil producers.
""Every time we can’t drill a well in America, terrorism is being funded,"" Hamm told the cheering crowd. ""Every onerous regulation puts American lives at risk."" 
Hamm, 70, became one of America's wealthiest men during the U.S. oil and gas drilling boom over the past decade, tapping into new hydraulic fracturing drilling technology to access vast deposits in North Dakota's shale fields.
Past heads of the U.S. Department of Energy, which is charged with advancing U.S. energy security and technology and dealing with nuclear waste disposal, have typically boasted a political or academic background.
This is not the first time Hamm has been in contention for the job.
The Republican Party's presidential nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, vetted Hamm to be energy secretary but ultimately decided against him because the two men have differing positions on renewable energy sources like wind.
He made headlines in 2015 after settling a protracted divorce case and agreeing to pay his ex-wife $975 million - reported to be the biggest divorce settlement in history. His fortune is now estimated at nearly $12 billion. 
""FRACKER-IN-CHIEF""
Trump, who has yet to make any announcements about his prospective cabinet, has already surrounded himself with strong advocates of traditional energy sources like oil, gas, and coal and has promised to gut environmental regulations to boost drilling and mining if elected.
He tapped U.S. Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a climate skeptic and drilling advocate, to help draw up his campaign energy platform, and picked Indiana Governor Mike Pence, also a climate skeptic, as his running mate. 
Both moves cheered the energy industry but alarmed environmental activists who say a Trump presidency would set back years of progress on issues like pollution and climate change. 
""Given that Hamm's as close as we've got to a fracker-in-chief in this country, it would be an apropos pick for a president who thinks global warming is a hoax manufactured by the Chinese,"" said leading environmental activist Bill McKibben. 

Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has promised to bolster regulation and increase use of renewable fuels to combat climate change if elected.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for September delivery rose 0.24% to $45.86 a barrel. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Brent crude for September delivery was up 0.47% to $47.33 a barrel.
Overnight, crude futures plunged to fresh two-year lows before staging a sharp reversal on Wednesday after a larger than expected draw in U.S. stockpiles and a considerable increase in gasoline inventories last week.
On Wednesday morning, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report that commercial crude inventories declined by 2.342 million barrels for the week ending on July 15. At 519.5 million barrels, inventories remain at historically high levels for this time of year. Investors expected to see a draw of 2.1 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute reported declines of 2.3 million on Tuesday night after the close of trading. Crude inventories nationwide have now declined in nine consecutive weeks.
At the Cushing Oil Hub in Oklahoma, crude inventories rose by 189,000 barrels, defying expectations for a 100,000 decline. Cushing, the main delivery point for NYMEX oil, is the largest storage facility in the U.S.
Notably, gasoline inventories rose by 0.91 million barrels for the week, while distillate fuel inventories fell slightly by 0.21 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose as much as 1 percent on Wednesday, lifting U.S. crude from two-month lows, after the U.S. government reported a ninth straight week of crude inventory draws, easing some concerns in a market worried about a glut.
U.S. gasoline prices, however, hit four-month lows after the data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration also showed a surprise build in supplies of the motor fuel despite forecasts of American drivers hitting the road in record numbers this summer. [EIA/S]
The EIA said crude inventories fell 2.3 million barrels in the week to July 15, close to analysts' expectations for a decrease of 2.1 million barrels. 
""While in line with expectations, the drawdown is large enough to provide support, and refiner demand for crude remains elevated,"" said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.
Gasoline stocks  rose 911,000 barrels, compared with forecasts for stocks to remain unchanged.
Stocks of the motor fuel rose in spite of gasoline output slipping 168,000 barrels per day even as refinery crude runs increased 319,000 bpd, the EIA data showed.
""We continue to see these builds in gasoline which suggest the market is fundamentally not sound to sustain a rally,"" said Tariq Zahir, a trader in WTI crude spreads at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.
Brent crude's front-month contract,  settled up 51 cents, or 1 percent, at $47.17 a barrel.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude's August  contract expired as the front-month after rising 29 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $44.94 a barrel. August WTI hit a two-month low of $43.69 earlier. September WTI , front-month from Thursday onwards, also settled up 0.7 percent.
Brent's premium versus WTI  reached its widest since the end of April, enhancing U.S. crude's export potential. 
U.S. gasoline (RBc1) fell nearly 1 percent to settle at $1.3637 per gallon. It hit a March low of $1.3381 earlier.
Oil prices are up nearly 75 percent since hitting 12-year lows of around $27 for Brent and about $26 for WTI in the first quarter. The rally stalled after the two benchmarks breached the $50 psychological barrier in May amid worries that higher prices will add to production.
Prices had been depressed lately by a glut in motor fuels despite the U.S. peak summer driving season.
""Absolute inventories rose to yet another new all-time record"" last week, Kyle Cooper, analyst at IAF Advisors in Houston said, referring to the 2.1 billion barrels of total petroleum supply, including strategic reserve stocks, cited by the EIA.

On Wednesday, economic indicators showed that consumer confidence in the European Union fell sharply by 1.8 in June to Minus-7.6, dropping to the lowest level since November, 2014. In the euro area, the DG ECFIN flash consumer confidence index declined by 0.7 from an upwardly revised Minus-7.2 to Minus-7.9. Analysts expected a reading of Minus-8.0. The Governing Council is widely expected to stand pat at Thursday's meeting, amid a relative lack of data following the U.K.'s decision to leave the EU on June 24.
The ECB meeting comes days before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will convene for its two-day July meeting in the middle of next week. Since the Fed left short-term interest rates unchanged at its June FOMC meeting, participants have been largely split on the timing of its next rate hike, amid strong employment and housing figures.

1225,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2016 03:10PM ET</span>",Halliburton signals better demand for fracking equipment,"By Swetha Gopinath
(Reuters) -  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) indicated that demand for its fracking equipment was returning, despite the fewer number of rigs at work, as high-intensity shale drilling soaked up all the available capacity in the market.
Halliburton is the world's largest provider of equipment used in hydraulic fracturing or fracking - the process of pumping water and chemicals, known as proppants, into shale rocks to extract oil and gas.
U.S. shale oil producers - Halliburton's customers - are now drilling longer horizontal wells with multiple fracking stages, and deploying more horsepower and proppants to cover larger areas. This high-intensity drilling is boosting demand for fracking equipment.
""Let me start today with a headline: 900 is the new 2,000 for U.S. rig activity,"" the company's president, Jeff Miller, said on a post-earnings call on Wednesday.
""I believe it will only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market.""
The company reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and said it expected a ""modest uptick"" in rig count in the second half of the year.
The U.S. rig count climbed by 7 to 447 in the week ended July 15, but is far short of the 1,931 at work in September 2014.
Demand for Halliburton and rival Schlumberger NV's (N:SLB) fracking equipment has also received a boost because a number of smaller services firms have mothballed equipment in response to a two-year rout in oil prices.
Even  Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI), the world's third-largest oilfield service firm, said in April it was limiting its exposure to the pressure pumping business in North America to two basins.
Many firms have also stripped idle fracking gear for parts to repair the ones in use.
Up to 4 million of horsepower, representing about a fifth of peak capacity has been permanently removed from the market, Halliburton's Miller said on the call.
Halliburton, however, preserved idle equipment, positioning the company to quickly get back to work.
A near 70 percent jump in U.S. benchmark oil prices (CLc1) since February has brought oil producers back to the shale patch. Many shale producers are now completing previously-drilled-but-uncompleted wells, and some even drilling new wells.
If a service firm were to re-activate cold-stacked equipment today, it would cost about $300,000, while replacing parts on cannibalized equipment may run into millions, said Evercore ISI analyst James West.
The high costs are likely to keep cannibalized equipment off the market, giving Halliburton an advantage, West said.

Schlumberger is scheduled to report quarterly results on Thursday.

1227,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 20, 2016 01:32PM ET</span>","Gold falls sharply extending losses, as dollar lingers near 4-month high","Investing.com -- Gold fell as much as 1% in Wednesday's session, as the dollar hovered around four-month highs, ahead of a critical interest rate decision by the European Central Bank's Governing Council on Thursday afternoon in Frankfurt.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded between $1,313.45 and $1,338.50 an ounce before settling at $1,319.45, down 12.85 or 0.96% on the session. At session-lows, Gold tumbled to its lowest level since late-June in the midst of the Post-Brexit rally. Despite the recent slide, Gold is still up more than 24% since January 1 and is on pace for one of its strongest years over the last decade.
Gold likely gained support at $1,253.70, the low from June 24 and was met with resistance at $1,368.60, the high from July 7.
Gold extended overnight losses, as investors awaited the ECB's Governing Council's first monetary policy meeting since last month's historic U.K. referendum. On Wednesday, economic indicators showed that consumer confidence in the European Union fell sharply by 1.8 in June to Minus-7.6, dropping to the lowest level since November, 2014. In the euro area, the DG ECFIN flash consumer confidence index declined by 0.7 from an upwardly revised Minus-7.2 to Minus-7.9. Analysts expected a reading of Minus-8.0. The Governing Council is widely expected to stand pat at Thursday's meeting, amid a relative lack of data following the U.K.'s decision to leave the EU on June 24.
The ECB meeting comes days before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will convene for its two-day July meeting in the middle of next week. Since the Fed left short-term interest rates unchanged at its June FOMC meeting, participants have been largely split on the timing of its next rate hike, amid strong employment and housing figures. The CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool now sees a 41.6% chance of a 25 point basis hike in December, up from around 20% last week.
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
Elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 60 points on Wednesday to an intraday high of 18,622.01, hitting an all-time intra-session high. With several hours left in Wednesday's session, the Dow was on pace for its ninth consecutive win – its longest streak in three years. As foreign investors have piled into U.S. equities in broad risk-on trade, gold has lost some momentum over the last week.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose by more than 0.20% to an intraday high of 97.37. At session-highs, the index reached its highest level since March 10.

However, elevated stocks of fuel products amid slowing demand growth is expected to keep prices under pressure.
Crude oil for September delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 12 cents, or 0.26%, to trade at $45.33 a barrel by 14:36GMT, or 10:36AM ET. Prices were at around $45.05 prior to the release of the inventory data after falling to a daily low of $44.55.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 2.3 million barrels in the week ended July 15. Market analysts' expected a crude-stock decline of 2.1 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply drop of 2.3 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, rose by 189,000 barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 519.5 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 0.9 million barrels, disappointing expectations for a decline of 0.8 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles decreased by 0.2 million barrels.
U.S. oil has been under pressure in recent sessions amid signs of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity. According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by six last week to 357, the third straight weekly rise and the sixth increase in seven weeks.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for September delivery dipped 15 cents, or 0.32%, to $46.51 a barrel, after sliding to an intraday low of $45.90, amid ongoing concerns over a global supply glut.

Natural gas for delivery in August on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by as much as 2.6% to touch a session low of $2.657 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since June 24. It last stood at $2.664 by 13:40GMT, or 9:40AM ET, down 6.4 cents, or 2.35%.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration's storage report slated for release on Thursday is expected to show a build in a range between 32 billion to 44 billion cubic feet for the week ending July 15.
That compares with an increase of 64 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 59 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 61 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.243 trillion cubic feet as of last week, 15.6% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 18.1% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
Natural gas prices are down more than 12% since reaching a 13-month high on July 1 amid speculation that July heat won’t prevent stockpiles from reaching a record before the winter.

Gold for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by as much as 1.2% to touch a session low of $1,316.00 a troy ounce, a level not seen since June 30. It last stood at $1,318.70 by 12:38GMT, or 8:38AM ET, down $13.60, or 1.02%.
A recent string of upbeat economic reports, including June housing starts, retail sales, ISM manufacturing and employment were all much better than expected, suggesting that economic growth regained speed in the second quarter.
The bullish data could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this year, but much will depend on policymakers' assessment of the impact on the U.S. economy of Britain's June 23 vote to leave the European Union.
Interest rate futures are currently pricing in a 47% chance of a rate hike by December, compared with less than 20% a week ago and up from 9% at the start of this month.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
The dollar climbed to a fresh four-month high early on Wednesday, boosted by Fed rate hike hopes.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.15% at 97.22, up from levels of around 96.00 just a week ago and the most since March 10.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
The yellow metal remained supported amid speculation central banks in Europe and Asia will step up monetary stimulus in the next few months to counteract the negative economic shock from the Brexit vote.
Expectations of monetary stimulus tend to benefit gold, as the metal is seen as a safe store of value and inflation hedge.
The precious metal is up almost 25% for the year to date, boosted by concerns over global growth and as market players pushed back expectations for the next U.S. rate hike.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for September delivery slumped 42.5 cents, or 2.12%, to trade at $19.58 a troy ounce during morning hours in New York, while copper futures dropped 2.9 cents, or 1.28%, to $2.234 a pound.

The oilfields services company posted an adjusted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.14, better than analysts' median estimate for -$0.19, according to Bloomberg. Revenues totaled $3.84 billion ($3.76 billion expected.)
""We believe the North America market has turned,"" said Halliburton CEO Dave Lesar in the  earnings statement. ""We expect to see a modest uptick in rig count during the second half of the year.""
Halliburton's North American revenues fell 15% to $1.5 billion during Q2. 
Lesar said there were still challenges in the Middle East and Asia, where revenues declined 3% from the first quarter.
The company's count of oil rigs fell 15% year-on-year, smaller than the average US count's decline by 23%. The company said it believes the count reached a ""landing point,"" as rising oil prices gave more producers confidence to bring more rigs online. 
In the last week of June, the  US oil rig count rose by 11, the most since six months, according to Baker Hughes. The tally's steep decline in the wake of the worst oil-price crash in decades stabilized around mid-May.
The company noted that in Q2, it paid Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion termination fee following the  scrapping of their $28 billion merger. The deal faced strong opposition from regulators in the US and in Europe. 
Halliburton shares were little changed in premarket trading after the earnings release. They've gained 32% this year. "

Market players looked ahead to the outcome of Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting to see if policymakers will step up monetary stimulus in wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union.
The consensus is that the central bank will leave interest rates on hold, while ECB President Mario Draghi is forecast to strike a dovish tone and perhaps hint at further stimulus to offset the hit to the economy from Britain's decision to leave the EU.
Traders are also focusing on whether the Bank of Japan will expand its monetary stimulus at its policy meeting later this month. The yen has been pressured by expectations that a double-bazooka of fiscal and monetary easing was on the cards in the weeks ahead.

Updated weather forecasting models showed that temperatures are expected to be warmer than previously projected in the central U.S. from July 20 to July 24, and sweltering conditions are also forecast for the West from July 25 to July 29.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Natural gas for delivery in August on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 3.7 cents, or 1.36%, to trade at $2.759 per million British thermal units by 14:35GMT, or 10:35AM ET.
A day earlier, natural gas lost 3.4 cents, or 1.23%, amid speculation that July heat won’t prevent stockpiles from reaching a record before the winter.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.243 trillion cubic feet as of last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 15.6% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 18.1% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
This week's storage report slated for release on Thursday is expected to show a build in a range between 32 billion to 44 billion cubic feet for the week ending July 15.
That compares with an increase of 64 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 59 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 61 billion cubic feet.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied above $47 a barrel on Tuesday helped by a new Libyan supply disruption but concerns over a global glut of crude and refined fuel capped gains.
A protest over wages that shut the eastern Libyan oil terminal of Hariga forced the operator of the Sarir field to suspend production of 100,000 barrels per day.
Libyan news and a rebound in stocks on the back of better than expected results by Wall Street Bank Goldman Sachs (N:GS) helped push oil prices slightly up but analysts said the market fundamentals still looked bearish.
""We are about to enter a period where the crude oil markets could start to feel more fully the pressure resulting from the come-back of Iran,"" said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix consultancy. ""Saudi Arabia is moving out of its peak seasonal demand for crude oil right when global refining margins are under strong pressure, and that is not a good combination.""
The market also awaited U.S. crude stocks data on Tuesday and Wednesday to help give direction to prices. 
Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 26 cents to $47.22 a barrel as of 1225 GMT, after falling 65 cents, or 1.4 percent, on Monday.
U.S. crude, known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), (CLc1) rose 18 cents to $45.42 a barrel after settling 71 cents, or about 1.6 percent, lower in the previous session. 
Fuel inventories in the United States, Europe and Asia are brimming despite this being the peak summer driving season, leading traders to store diesel on tankers at sea as growth in demand eases. With landed oil product storage nearly full as well, there is little support for any sustained recovery in crude prices even as output tapers. 
U.S. shale oil production is expected to fall in August for a 10th straight month, by 99,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 4.55 million bpd, according to a U.S. drilling productivity report on Monday.
Further weighing on supply, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories probably fell by 2.2 million barrels last week, a Reuters poll showed on Monday. 
That would be the ninth consecutive week stocks have fallen. 

The poll was taken ahead of weekly oil stocks reports due on Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute (API) and on Wednesday from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Gold for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up $1.65, or 0.12%, to trade at $1,330.85 a troy ounce by 06:56GMT, or 2:56AM ET. A day earlier, prices tacked on $1.90, or 0.14%.
Gold has been drawing support from growing expectations that central banks around the world will step up monetary stimulus in the near-term to counteract the negative economic shock from the Brexit vote.
Market players looked ahead to the outcome of Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting to see if policymakers will step up monetary stimulus in wake of Britain's vote to exit the European Union.
The consensus is that the central bank will leave interest rates on hold, while ECB President Mario Draghi is forecast to strike a dovish tone and perhaps hint at further stimulus to offset the hit to the economy from Britain's decision to leave the EU.
Traders are also focusing on whether the Bank of Japan will expand its monetary stimulus at its policy meeting later this month. The yen has been pressured by expectations that a double-bazooka of fiscal and monetary easing was on the cards in the weeks ahead.
Investors are also wagering on a rate cut from the Bank of England in August, while few see much chance of the Federal Reserve hiking U.S. rates anytime soon.
Expectations of monetary stimulus tend to benefit gold, as the metal is seen as a safe store of value and inflation hedge.
The precious metal is up almost 25% for the year to date, boosted by concerns over global growth and as market players pushed back expectations for the next U.S. rate hike.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 1 percent on Monday after rising stockpiles of crude and refined fuel intensified fears of another major glut building.
Market intelligence firm Genscape reported that the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub for U.S. crude futures saw a supply build of 26,460 barrels in the week to July 15, traders who saw the data said.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said it still expected a supply-demand rebalancing in oil by mid-2017 but added that fundamental headwinds were growing the market. ""Tail risks are admittedly large in both directions, as geopolitics add to uncertainty.""
An attempted coup in Turkey barely supported the market as Istanbul's Bosphorus Strait, which handles about 3 percent of global oil shipments mainly from Black Sea ports and the Caspian region, reopened from a brief closure.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 84 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $46.77 a barrel by 12:41 p.m. EDT (1641 GMT). It fell more than $1 earlier to an intraday low of $46.50.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) slid by 82 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $45.13 a barrel, after a session low of $44.86.
Prices came off session lows after a labor union said a 24-hour strike on July 26 by Wood Group (L:WG) oil and gas maintenance workers employed at Royal Dutch Shell's (L:RDSa) platforms in the North Sea will severely disrupt operations.
""We are maintaining a bearish trading stance as we still see an ultimate price downdraft in WTI and Brent to about $37 and $38 areas respectively,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates.
Morgan Stanley said in a report that demand for fuels such as diesel and gasoline were lagging petrochemicals, clouding the outlook for oil.
""A rapid rise of non-petroleum products (demand) is boosting total product demand, but this is unhelpful for crude oil. Based on the latest data, even our tepid 800,000 barrels per day growth estimate for global crude runs looks too high,"" it said.
U.S. gasoline and distillate stocks surged unexpectedly last week, government data showed, crimping margins for refiners at the height of summer driving season when demand for fuels were generally healthy.
Oil prices are up nearly 75 percent since hitting 12-year lows of around $27 for Brent and about $26 for U.S. crude in the first quarter. The rally has stalled since the two benchmarks breached the $50 a barrel mark in May as worries grew that higher prices will fuel more production.

Hedge funds last week cut their bullish bets on Brent to the lowest since February even they raised their positive wagers on U.S. crude, data showed.

1253,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2016 09:41AM ET</span>","After Brexit, ordinary Britons warm to gold as safe haven","By Clara Denina 
LONDON (Reuters) - When Britain voted to leave the European Union, the thoughts of Yorkshire teacher Grace Hall immediately turned to her family's bottom line.
Three days later, as UK stocks and sterling plummeted, she put those thoughts into action and deposited part of her life savings -- 25,000 pounds -- into gold.
""My husband and I are both worried about bank failures and our cash getting swallowed up,"" she said. ""I'm also worried about our kids' jobs and their future.""
Hall was not alone. Dealers are seeing an unprecedented amount of interest in gold, much of it from first-time buyers, to take advantage of its role as a safe haven in times of stress or unexpected ""black swan"" events like Brexit.
""The speed at which people are purchasing gold is unprecedented,"" said Joshua Saul, CEO of The Pure Gold Company, where Hall bought and keeps her Britannia coins.
""We are seeing people convert as much as 40 to 50 percent of their net worth into physical gold, (compared to) 5 to 10 percent in the past,"" he said.
Government-owned bar and coin producer, the Royal Mint, saw a 7-fold increase in sales of 100-gram bars, around half the size of a credit card and costing around $4,400, in the two weeks following the June 23 vote. 
Around 4 million pounds ($5.5 million) of gold and silver were traded online on the platform of London-based Bullionvault.com on the June 25-26 weekend, seven times the average weekend of the previous 12 months.
The number of first-time UK buyers on the site rose by around 170 percent in June and the first week of July, compared to the previous 12-month daily average, it said.
The surge in gold buying is in contrast with Brexit's effect on the London property market, considered an ironclad bet for the past 20 years. More than 18 billion pounds of property funds aimed at retail investors was frozen in early July following a tide of redemption requests after the Brexit vote.
One London-based property developer said the current sense of panic over the UK financial system was unlike anything he had ever seen. 
""I just can't believe what's going on,"" he said, asking not to be named. ""Projects that were meant to happen now haven't and the last thing I would do right now is buy another property.""
Instead, he has bought £350,000 worth of gold and plans to hold it for at least the next two years.
NO SIGNS OF DECLINE
It's not the first time Britons have turned to gold -- dealers saw buying surge in the initial phases of the subprime crisis at the end of 2008 and during Europe's debt crisis in 2012 and 2013. But the interest dissipated quickly, the dealers said. This time could be different.
""This shows little sign of declining,"" the Royal Mint said in a statement. Half of the buyers choose to store the metal in the mint's vault, it said.
Gold has played a central role in trade and exchange over the centuries, with bullion coins circulating as currency in several countries until World War One. During the time of the ""gold standard"" of the 19th century, nearly all countries fixed their currencies against a specified amount of gold. 
Countries like Germany, with its experience of hyperinflation, have maintained a historical connection to gold as a tangible asset that can protect wealth against economic downturns and currency fluctuations. 
German consumers buy more than 100 tonnes of gold coins and bars a year and spent around $4.6 billion on gold in 2015. 
British interest in gold, by contrast, has been lukewarm in modern times because of the pound's role as a global reserve currency, even when sterling was tested by crashing out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in 1992.
Britain ranks 15th among the biggest consumers of gold bars and coins.
""In Germany's economic history between 1922 and 1961, some people lived through three or four expropriations or collapses of wealth, so there is an embedded sense of caution,"" said Brian Lucey, Professor of Finance at Trinity College Dublin.
""The UK is not at that level at all but certainly continued gold retail buying is another indicator of the effect that Brexit has had,"" he said.
Adam Cleary, 42, bought gold ahead of the referendum to protect himself from the event of a Brexit vote but also because of his distrust of the banking system. 
He explained the attraction by harking back to the old days of trade.
""It cannot be canceled, it cannot be confiscated, it cannot be taken away,"" he said in the showroom of dealer Sharps Pixley, where investors can keep their investments in safety deposit boxes.

(This story corrects to make clear that 4 million pounds of gold and silver were traded online on June 25-26, not Britannia coins)

1259,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2016 01:30AM ET</span>",North American oil deals trickle back after Brexit shock,"By Mike Stone and Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Acquisition-hungry energy companies are back on the prowl.
Dealmakers have recovered from the shock of Britain's ""Brexit"" vote last month to leave the European Union and have resumed buying oil and gas fields in choice locations in Canada and the United States, restocking their inventories on a bet that a two-year slump in the price of oil has abated.
""Buyers are increasingly confident in a stable to slowly increasing oil price - as are their funding sources, whether private equity funds or public market investors,"" said Bobby Tudor, chief executive of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, an oil and gas investment bank.
Oil prices (CLc1) have held steady at or above $45 a barrel for a majority of the last two months and touched a 2016 high above $51, ahead of the British referendum.
Tudor said buyers were banking on it eventually settling at around $60 a barrel, giving them confidence about buying drilling acreage in some of the nation's shale heartlands.
U.S. oil and gas producer  Diamondback Energy Inc  (O:FANG) last week said it would spend $560 million buying leases on oil-rich land in the Southern Delaware Basin, within the Permian Basin, the top U.S. oilfield, where initial production results have been strong and costs are coming down.
A day later, U.S. energy company Laredo Petroleum Inc (N:LPI) said it would spend $125 million buying acreage in the Midland Basin, also part of the Permian.
These deals mark a resumption in buying after Brexit caused a temporary lull in acquisitions.
Before the British referendum on June 23, buyers and sellers had grown comfortable with the idea that oil had rebounded from 12-year lows. That conviction helped to unclog the acquisition pipeline after a long-dormant period in which deals were offered but failed to materialize.
About $5.1 billion of U.S. and Canadian properties traded hands in June, the largest dollar amount in more than a year according to PLS Inc, global M&A database for such deals.
Acreage deals create confidence and open the door to acquisitions of entire companies, so long as oil remains relatively steady, according to nearly a dozen dealmakers interviewed by Reuters.
More acreage deals are in the works, including ones that involve large exploration and production (E&P) companies such as Anadarko Petroleum Corp (N:APC) and Southwestern Energy Co (N:SWN), according to people familiar with the matter.
Restructuring bankers and attorneys anticipate that exploration and production companies that have emerged from bankruptcy, like Magnum Hunter Resources, or are going through the process, like  Ultra Petroleum Corp  (UPLMQ.PK), will be merger and acquisition targets for other oil and gas companies because they are financially healthy, having eliminated much of their debt.
Magnum Hunter and Ultra Petroleum did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Publicly traded companies are warming up to deals now, a change from when deals were mainly stagnant or acreage was sold to private equity firms in small transactions. Traditional E&P companies dominated acquisition activity in the second quarter, representing 69 percent and 76 percent of total transactions and deal value, respectively, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Thursday.
PRICE AND PRIME LOCATIONS
The key dynamic that has developed and allowed buyers and sellers to get back to cutting deals is price. 
Greater stability around the price of oil has enabled both sides to negotiate, where previously expectations of further falls kept them apart.
Leading into the spate of deals in June was a nine-week period of relatively low oil volatility, when prices rose about 20 percent and traded between about $40 and $50 a barrel. 
Transactions in June occurred at prices about 10 percent higher than the far forward crude price for three years out , according to bankers. That implies that buyers and sellers could agree upon a price of about $60 per barrel, the bankers said.
That forward price has now returned to its pre-Brexit levels of about $54 a barrel, enabling deals once again.
Another key ingredient for completed deals was their location. Many of the sales occurred in areas with the highest margins where pumping at about $50 per barrel is profitable. 
The acreage most sought-after is in Texas' Permian Basin and in Oklahoma's STACK area (Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Counties), popular because of their easy-to-extract rock formations and relatively low break-even prices. 
In June,  Marathon Oil  Corp (N:MRO) said it would spend about $888 million to acquire STACK acreage and  Devon Energy  Corp (N:DVN) said it would sell Texas acreage to  Pioneer Natural Resources  (N:PXD) and an undisclosed buyer for $858 million.
HOPING FOR HIGHER OIL PRICES 
While there could be hurdles such as resurgent output and deceleration in demand growth over the next few months, many producers are more bullish on the prices of oil long-term.
""Investors have become overly bearish on oil as concerns over rising U.S. rig activity and high fuel inventories raised doubts about the rebalancing of the market. We think those concerns are unwarranted,"" ANZ said in a note.
""We think any further decline in prices will accelerate the supply closures again and set the stage for an even stronger price recovery in 2017.""
On Friday, U.S. oil prices ended the week 1 percent higher. [O/R] 
Acreage inventory is being offered for sale, including 180,000 acres of West Virginia holdings currently belonging to Southwestern Energy Co (N:SWN), people familiar with the deal said. Southwestern declined to comment. 

Anadarko is marketing 86,000 net acres in East Texas, one person familiar with the deal said, adding that the deal could fetch as much as $1 billion. A spokesman for Anadarko declined to comment.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in August rose 0.24% to $46.76 a barrel. On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for September delivery rose 0.57% to $47.88 a barrel.
Last week, oil futures ended Friday’s session higher, as better-than-expected economic data from the U.S. and China bolstered the outlook for future energy demand.
Crude prices received a further boost in post-settlement trade after news broke of an apparent military coup in Turkey. But the coup attempt crumbled as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rushed back to Istanbul from a Mediterranean holiday and urged people to take to the streets in support of his government against plotters he accused of trying to kill him.
Earlier, oil prices hit session highs after data showed that U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in June, as Americans bought motor vehicles and a variety of other goods, bolstering views that economic growth picked up in the second quarter.
Those expectations were further reinforced by other data on Friday showing that industrial production recorded its biggest increase in 11 months in June, driven by a surge in motor vehicle assembly. With domestic demand strengthening, inflation is also steadily rising.
The New York Fed raised its third-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 2.6% rate from the 2.3% it projected a week ago. The economy grew at a 1.1% pace in the January-March quarter.
Meanwhile, China's economy grew 6.7% in the second quarter from a year-ago, unchanged from the first quarter, data showed on Friday. Analysts had expected it to dip to 6.6%.Also in China, fixed asset investment rose 9.0%, less than the 9.4% year-on-year gain seen in June, while industrial production gained 6.2%, better than 5.9% seen in the same period and retail sales rose 10.6%, a tad better than 10.0% seen.
The U.S. and China are the world’s two largest oil consuming nations.
Gains were limited amid signs of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity. Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by six last week to 357, the third straight weekly gain and the sixth increase in seven weeks.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude oil inventories declined by a less-than-expected 2.5 million barrels last week to 521.8 million, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
In the week ahead, oil traders will be focusing on U.S. stockpile data on Tuesday and Wednesday for fresh supply-and-demand signals.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded between $1,322.56 and $1,336.50 before settling at $1,327.85, down 4.45 or 0.33% on the session. After surging to 28-month highs last week, Gold has retreated over the last seven sessions, losing approximately 2% in value over the span holding near two-week lows. With the declines, Gold finished with its first negative week since early-June. Still, the precious metal is on track for one of its strongest years on record after soaring roughly 25% year to date.
Gold likely gained support at $1,323.50, the low from June 8 and was met with resistance at $1,391.40 the high from March 17, 2014.

The gains fell slightly below analysts' expectations of a 0.3% increase, one month after rising by 0.2% in May. On a yearly basis, consumer prices rose by 1.0%, one month after rising by an upwardly revised 1.1%.
The Core CPI Index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, increased by 0.2% in line with consensus estimates. At the same time, Core CPI  over the last 12 months has shot up by 2.3%, slightly above annual gains of 2.2% in May. Energy prices in June jumped by 1.3%, echoing similar gains over the prior four months. The relatively soft inflation figures may do little to compel dovish members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to approve a short-term interest rate hike in the coming months.
On Thursday, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard, Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart and Dallas Fed president Rob Kaplan all reiterated that the FOMC should take a patient approach with the timing of future rate increases.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for gold, which struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in periods of rising rate environments.

Crude oil for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 53 cents, or 1.16%, to trade at $45.15 a barrel by 8:40 AMGMT, or 4:40AM ET.
A day earlier, New York-traded oil gained $0.77, or 1.72%, bouncing off near two-month lows amid heavy short covering on Thursday, even as investors expressed significant concerns on a global oil and gasoline supply glut in the wake of a bearish U.S. stockpile report from the previous session.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for September delivery lost 54 cents, 1.14%, to $46.83 a barrel, after having closed up $0.96, or 2.08%, on Thursday.
Positive figures with China’s gross domestic product (GDP) helped pare the losses after showing a 6.7% gain in the second quarter ended June year-on-year period, beating the 6.6% rise seen, and also rose 1.8% quarter-on-quarter, better than the 1.6% increase expected.
Also in China, fixed asset investment rose 9.0%, less than the 9.4% year-on-year gain seen in June, while industrial production gained 6.2%, better than 5.9% seen in the same period and retail sales rose 10.6%, a tad better than 10.0% seen.
While crude inventories in the U.S. fell by a less-than-expected 2.5 million barrels over the first week of July, market players focused more intently on a considerable 4.1 million build in distillate fuel inventories, the largest weekly amount in six months.
Even as travel throughout the U.S. remains high during the key summer driving season, demand in gasoline has not been strong enough to offset vast supply builds. At the Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts 1 (PADD 1) region in the East Coast, distillate fuel inventories rose by 1.172 million last week, representing nearly one-third of the overall gains.
The sizable build prompted analysts from Energy Aspects to issue predictions of further declines in oil prices, due to the ""epic gasoline surplus.""
Investors continued to digest a bullish monthly report from OPEC earlier in the week after the world's largest oil cartel said it expects world demand to increase by 1.2 million barrels per day in 2017, climbing at a faster pace than current supply estimates. For the time being, however, energy traders focused on reports of swelling supply levels among top OPEC producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran. In June, the Saudi kingdom pumped an additional 66,500 bpd in comparison with its output in May, as production rose to 10.308 million bpd.
As a result, OPEC output for the month averaged 32.86 million bpd, up 264,000 from the previous report. Notably, the measure included the return of Gabon to the group, adding an additional 214,000 to the monthly total.
As U.S. output continues to level off from 44-year highs last summer, producers in the Middle East have seized market share. Following the latest supply gains from OPEC, the influential International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that producers in the Middle East now control their largest share of the overall global energy market since the late 1970s.
Market participants will continue to eye production in the U.S. with the Baker Hughes’ data out later on Thursday.
According to oilfield services provider, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by 10 last week to 351, marking the fifth increase in six weeks.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Crude futures dipped in Asian trading on Friday on renewed concerns about a global oil glut, but losses were capped by slightly better than expected Chinese economic data reflecting government efforts to stabilize growth.
Brent crude futures were down 51 cents at $46.86 a barrel at 0650 GMT. On Thursday, they rose 2.4 percent, supported by short covering, and were on track to be flat for the week.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were down 47 cents at $45.21 a barrel having earlier fallen to $45.05. The contract rose 2.1 percent in the previous session and is heading for a weekly gain of 0.4 percent.
Prices partly retraced their losses after China reported economic growth of 6.7 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. The result was steady from the first quarter and slightly better than expected as the government stepped up efforts to stabilize growth in the world's second-largest economy.
While fears of a hard landing in China have eased, investors are concerned a further slowdown and any major fallout from Britain's decision to leave the EU earlier this month would leave the world even more vulnerable to the risk of a global recession.
At the same time, persistent oversupply of crude oil is not clearing as early as many had expected, reports from the International Energy Agency and the U.S. official energy think tank showed this week.

""As such, the inventory overhang built from the start of 2014 will remain largely in place, and thus continues to represent an impediment to any price rally,"" BNP said.

The launch comes amid a punishing rout in commodity prices because of slowing growth in China. The price of U.S. crude oil has lost more than half its value, copper is down about 30 percent and natgas has dropped by 60 percent over the past two years.
The average hedge fund with an energy-biased strategy rose by just 0.4 percent in the five months through May, after losing 1 percent in 2015, according to figures compiled by Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research.
The Impala fund will invest in commodities directly and the stocks of mining, energy and industrial companies who benefit from higher commodity prices, according to a person familiar with the fund who was not permitted to speak publicly.
Copper, iron ore, zinc and lumber were all favored by Impala now, the person added.
The fund will be ""substantially net long,"" according to the letter, meaning it will carry additional risk by not using substantial market hedges.
Bishop started Impala in late 2003 after stints at large hedge fund firms including Tiger Management and Soros Fund Management.
Impala’s main fund that bets both for and against stocks gained 8.1 percent this year through June, according to the letter. Commodity-related equity stock investments for the firm include  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO), Teck Resources and  Newmont Mining  Corp (NYSE:NEM), according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing for holdings as of March 31.

1280,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2016 04:30PM ET</span>",Energy companies spend big to fight Colorado ballot initiatives,"By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Energy companies in Colorado are spending millions of dollars to derail a push by environmentalists to put measures on November's ballot that would stifle oil and gas drilling in the state, according to a Reuters review of campaign finance records.
Environmental groups are now gathering signatures for two statewide initiatives that would transfer regulatory control of oil and gas development to local governments and create more stringent setback requirements to keep oil and gas activities away from occupied structures.
The state's Supreme Court this year struck down fracking bans approved by voters in the cities of Fort Collins and Longmont.
A study by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, a state agency tasked with encouraging energy development, found that 90 percent of the surface acreage in Colorado would be unavailable for oil and gas development under the new setback laws, which would require all new development facilities to be 2,500 feet from occupied structures and areas of interest, such as parks.
In the last three months alone, energy companies including Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC),  Noble Energy  (NYSE:NBL) and Whiting Petroleum, have together donated more than $6.7 million to Protect Colorado, a industry-backed coalition fighting the initiatives, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance disclosures.
The heavy spending comes despite a severe crash in oil and gas prices that has forced many energy companies to slash jobs, dividends and investments.
Opponents of the proposed ballot initiatives say they would have a calamitous impact on Colorado, which is the country's seventh-largest oil and gas producing state, with vast untapped fields.
Anadarko Petroleum since early April has donated nearly $3 million to the group, bringing its total aggregate contribution to more than $4 million.
A spokesman for the company said the initiative would be ""devastating for Colorado.""
Noble Energy donated $2.5 million to Protect Colorado at the end of April. Noble said the initiatives would harm the economy and cause job losses, and reduce funds for schools and other public services.
In June, Bayswater Exploration and Production, DCP Midstream, an affiliate of Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), Synergy Resources Corp and Whiting Petroleum Corp gave a combined $785,000 to Protect Colorado. Independent producer PDC Energy has given more than $1 million to the organization since it registered as an issue committee in 2014.
The initiatives each need 98,492 signatures collected by Aug. 8 to qualify for the November ballot.
Todd Ely, on the faculty of the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver, said there is no limit on donations the companies can make because the coalition formed around an issue.
""The outcome is critical to existing and future investments in Colorado and elsewhere, especially for a cyclical industry,"" he said.
Coloradans Resisting Extreme Energy Development, among the groups collecting signatures, declined to comment on the number gathered thus far. But Lisa Trope of Food & Water Watch said she was optimistic the measures would get on the ballot.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for August delivery traded between $44.96 and $45.80 a barrel before closing at $45.53, up $0.77 or 1.72% on the session. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for September delivery wavered between $46.34 and $47.47 a barrel, before settling at $47.22, up 0.96 and 2.08% on the day. Crude futures recovered somewhat one day after plummeting 4%, following a lower than expected supply draw in the U.S. last week.
While crude inventories in the U.S. fell by 2.5 million barrels over the first week of July, market players focused more intently on a considerable 4.1 million build in distillate fuel inventories, the largest weekly amount in six months. Even as travel throughout the U.S. remains high during the key summer driving season, demand in gasoline has not been strong enough to offset vast supply builds. At the Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts 1 (PADD 1) region in the East Coast, distillate fuel inventories rose by 1.172 million last week, representing nearly one-third of the overall gains. The sizable build prompted analysts from Energy Aspects to issue predictions of further declines in oil prices, due to the ""epic gasoline surplus.""
Investors continued to digest a bullish monthly report from OPEC earlier in the week after the world's largest oil cartel said it expects world demand to increase by 1.2 million barrels per day in 2017, climbing at a faster pace than current supply estimates. For the time being, however, energy traders focused on reports of swelling supply levels among top OPEC producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran. In June, the Saudi kingdom pumped an additional 66,500 bpd in comparison with its output in May, as production rose to 10.308 million bpd. As a result, OPEC output for the month averaged 32.86 million bpd, up 264,000 from the previous report. Notably, the measure included the return of Gabon to the group, adding an additional 214,000 to the monthly total.
As U.S. output continues to level off from 44-year highs last summer, producers in the Middle East have seized market share. Following the latest supply gains from OPEC, the influential International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that producers in the Middle East now control their largest share of the overall global energy market since the late 1970s.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.30% to an intra-session low of 95.84. The index has fallen by more than 3% since early-December.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded between $1,320.00 and $1,347.85, before settling at $1,332.25, down $11.35 or 0.84% on the session. Since hitting 28-month highs last week, Gold has closed lower in five of the last six sessions while losing approximately 2% in value. At session-lows, the front month contract for Gold tumbled to its lowest level for the month of July. Nevertheless, the precious metal has still surged roughly 25% on the calendar year since opening 2016 around $1,075 an ounce.
Gold likely gained support at $1,323.50, the low from June 8 and was met with resistance at $1,391.40 the high from March 17, 2014.
On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Composite surged to fresh all-time highs after JP Morgan kicked off the second quarter earnings season for major banks by topping analysts' earnings forecasts by a wide margin. JP Morgan, the world's largest bank, reported adjusted earnings per share of 1.55 (expected EPS 1.46) and revenue of $25.2 billion, up more than 0.5% on both a quarterly and annual basis. It came amid soaring revenues from the company's Fixed Income division, which ended the quarter with $3.96 billion in revenues, up 35% from the same period last year. As a result, the Dow remained on pace for its third straight record close while the S&P was on pace to close at an all-time high for the fourth consecutive session.
Elsewhere, initial U.S. jobless claims last week were unchanged at a seasonally-adjusted total of 254,000, lingering near 43-year lows. In April, new jobless claims throughout the U.S. fell by 6,000 to 247,000, dropping to their lowest level since November, 1973. Meanwhile, the four-week average on Thursday declined slightly to 259,000, falling roughly 10,000 below the one-month mean from mid-June.
Also on Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department reported that producer prices last month rose considerably, building on increased pricing pressure from May's report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' PPI-FD rose by 0.5% in June, slightly up from 0.4% gains a month earlier and above consensus estimates of 0.3%. The Core PPI-FD, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, jumped 0.3% on a monthly basis, swinging to a gain after a slight decrease of 0.1% in May.
During a series of public appearances since the Fed last met in late-June, a wide range of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members have offered diverging comments on the timing of the U.S. central bank's next rate hike. While delivering a speech in Houston on Wednesday, Dallas Fed president Rob Kaplan indicated that the FOMC can remain accommodative as long as its dual mandate in terms of inflation and employment objectives are not met. Shortly after, Philadelphia Fed president Patrick Harker said the FOMC could raise short-term interest rates as much as twice this year.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bearish for gold, which struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
In the U.K., the Bank of England surprised markets by holding their key interest rate steady at 0.5% and leaving a comprehensive Quantitative Easing program unchanged. Following the 8-1 vote, Bank of England governor Mark Carney hinted that the BOE could approve fresh stimulus measures when meets again in August. GBP/USD jumped by more than 1.5% to an intraday high of 1.3463, its highest level in two weeks.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended July 8 rose by 64 billion cubic feet, above forecasts for an increase of 59 billion.
That compared with builds of 39 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 98 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 77 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.243 trillion cubic feet, 15.6% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 18.1% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
Futures are up nearly 45% since late May as expectations have grown that hot summer weather will lead to heavy demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.

1289,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2016 11:41PM ET</span>",U.S. challenges China raw material export duties in trade enforcement push,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States challenged China's export duties on nine key metals and minerals on Wednesday, arguing they violate Beijing's commitments to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and give an unfair advantage to Chinese manufacturers.
China said it respected WTO rules and that the duties had been imposed as part of efforts at environmental protection.
The U.S. move came with the Obama administration eager to demonstrate that it is taking a tough stance on enforcing international trade agreements, which have come under fire from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and from within Obama's own Democratic party.
Vice President Joe Biden later on Wednesday was due to tout President Barack Obama's trade enforcement record as being more aggressive than past administrations in a speech at the Port of San Diego, with 22 WTO cases filed against trading partners since 2009 - including 16 aimed at China.
U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said the raw materials case seeks to remove China's export duties of 5 percent to 20 percent on antimony, cobalt, copper, graphite, lead, various magnesia compounds, talc, tantalum and tin, which it said are key inputs into U.S. industries, including aerospace, autos, electronics and chemicals.
He said the duties impose higher costs on U.S. manufacturers, while Chinese competitors do not have to pay them, encouraging companies to locate production in China.
""These duties are China's attempt to game the system so that raw materials are cheaper for their manufacturers and more expensive for ours,"" Froman said in a statement. 
""This scheme is directly at odds with WTO commitments China has made, and, as we've shown time and again, we will hold them accountable to their commitments.""
China's Commerce Ministry expressed regret at the decision, and said it would handle it according to the WTO dispute resolution process.
China's export duties have been imposed in the face of ""daily worsening pressure on resources and the environment"" and are to help with sustainable development.
""They are a part of overall measures to strengthen environmental protection and accord with WTO rules,"" it said.
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) said that China had committed, as part of the terms of its joining the WTO in 2001, that it would eliminate export duties for all products other than those listed in a specific annex, which exclude the nine metals and minerals named in the case.
As a result of other WTO challenges, USTR says that China in April agreed to scrap some export subsidies and the United States won a ruling against Chinese import duties on certain U.S. high-tech steel products. Meanwhile, the U.S. Commerce Department has imposed steep anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on a range of Chinese steel products. 
But in a signal that the steel trade brawl will keep escalating, China's Ministry of Commerce said on Wednesday that it would seek relief from the WTO after accusing the United States of deliberately misinterpreting WTO rules in applying anti-dumping duties on Chinese-made stainless steel sheet and strip products. 
In the raw materials challenge, the dollar value of individual mineral imports in some cases are relatively small, but they have a big impact on industries, Obama administration officials said.

For example, they said graphite imports from China were about $24 million last year, but the mineral is not produced in the United States and is a key ingredient in brake linings, an industry which supports 20,000 U.S. jobs, and in lithium ion batteries for electric cars as well as in lubricants.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for August delivery rose 1.27% to $45.32 a barrel. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Brent crude for September delivery gained 1.10% to $46.77 a barrel.
Overnight, crude futures fell sharply on Wednesday, retreating back near two-month lows, as investors shrugged off a modest draw in U.S. oil stockpiles placing a greater focus on the sharpest build in distillate fuel inventories in six months.
On Wednesday morning, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report that commercial crude inventories decreased by 2.5 million barrels last week for the week ending on July 8. At 521.8 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are still at historically high levels for this time of year. The draw fell in line with analysts' estimates for a decline of 3.0 million barrels, while defying expectations from the American Petroleum Institute of gains of 2.2 million barrels.
Notably, gasoline inventories increased by 1.2 million barrels for the week, while distillate fuel stockpiles soared by 4.1 million barrels. The gains were concentrated in the Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts 1 (PADD 1) region, which covers a sizeable area of the East Coast. In PADD 1 alone, distillate fuel inventories rose by 1.172 million last week, representing nearly 30% of the overall gains.
While consumers continue to spend at the pump at a steady rate, they haven't traveled enough over the key summer driving season to push gasoline inventories dramatically lower or offset the excessive supply gains.
With gasoline stockpiles remaining far above their five-year average, refiners have been forced to halt production leading to seasonally-low levels in the so-called ""crack spread"". On Wednesday, the RBOB crack spread or the premium of a barrel of gas over a barrel of crude hovered around $12, hitting a five-year low for mid-July. By comparison, the spread stood at $18 two months ago and $28 in the middle of last summer.
Without a considerable spike in gasoline demand in the coming weeks, refiners could be forced to remain on the sidelines, further squeezing their margins.

In the U.K., former Home Secretary Theresa May was confirmed as Britain's second-ever female prime minister and 54th in history, after David Cameron officially resigned from the position on Wednesday. While it is unclear if May's appointment will boost the U.K.'s chances of gaining access to the European Union's single market, the move helped ease investor sentiments on the strength of the British economy for the time being. When Cameron announced his intentions to step down in late June, he sent indications that he could remain in his post until early-September, potentially stalling any meaningful developments in discussions between U.K. and EU officials.
At a press conference outside 10 Downing Street, May promised that the U.K. will forge a bold new role following the decision from voters to leave the EU.

The draw fell in line with analysts' estimates for a decline of 3.0 million barrels, while defying expectations from the American Petroleum Institute of gains of 2.2 million barrels.
Notably, gasoline inventories increased by 1.2 million barrels for the week, while distillate fuel stockpiles soared by 4.1 million barrels. The gains were concentrated in the Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts 1 (PADD 1) region, which covers a sizeable area of the East Coast. In PADD 1 alone, distillate fuel inventories rose by 1.172 million last week, representing nearly 30% of the overall gains.
While consumers continue to spend at the pump at a steady rate, they haven't traveled enough over the key summer driving season to push gasoline inventories dramatically lower or offset the excessive supply gains.
With gasoline stockpiles remaining far above their five-year average, refiners have been forced to halt production leading to seasonally-low levels in the so-called ""crack spread"". On Wednesday, the RBOB crack spread or the premium of a barrel of gas over a barrel of crude hovered around $12, hitting a five-year low for mid-July. By comparison, the spread stood at $18 two months ago and $28 in the middle of last summer. Without a considerable spike in gasoline demand in the coming weeks, refiners could be forced to remain on the sidelines, further squeezing their margins.

In the U.K., former Home Secretary Theresa May was confirmed as Britain's second-ever female prime minister and 54th in history, after David Cameron officially resigned from the position on Wednesday. While it is unclear if May's appointment will boost the U.K.'s chances of gaining access to the European Union's single market, the move helped ease investor sentiments on the strength of the British economy for the time being. When Cameron announced his intentions to step down in late June, he sent indications that he could remain in his post until early-September, potentially stalling any meaningful developments in discussions between U.K. and EU officials.
At a press conference outside 10 Downing Street, May promised that the U.K. will forge a bold new role following the decision from voters to leave the EU.
""Together we will build a better Britain,"" May said.
GBP/USD extended gains from the previous session to hit an intraday high of 1.3337, nearing its highest level in two weeks. Last week, the Pound crashed to fresh 31-year lows against the U.S. Dollar after a host of top commercial property funds halted redemptions, sending shockwaves through markets in the euro area. The Pound pared gains in the U.S. afternoon session to trade at 1.3188, halting some of the momentum from Tuesday's massive rally.
Elsewhere, investors digested conflicting reports that Japan could adopt a helicopter monetary policy following former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke's meeting with Abe on Tuesday in Tokyo. The concept of helicopter money involves large scale printing of money by a central bank that is distributed to the public as a way for helping stimulate the economy. Abe unveiled a sweeping reform after his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) triumphed in upper-house elections over the weekend, which includes a ¥10 trillion ($98 billion) stimulus plan.
In addition, the Japanese government lowered its annual March, 2017 consumer inflation forecast from 1.2 to 0.4% on Wednesday. As a result, the dollar pared earlier losses against the Yen, trading at 104.30, down 0.17% on the session.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration's storage report slated for release on Thursday is expected to show a build in a range between 55 billion to 65 billion cubic feet for the week ending July 8.
That compared with builds of 39 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 98 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 77 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.179 trillion cubic feet, 16.9% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 18.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
Natural gas for delivery in August on the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up 2.9 cents, or 1.06%, to trade at $2.763 per million British thermal units by 13:35GMT, or 9:35AM ET. A day earlier, natural gas futures tacked on 3.2 cents, or 1.18%.
Futures are up nearly 45% since late May as expectations have grown that hot summer weather will lead to heavy demand.

Expectations of monetary stimulus tend to benefit gold, as the metal is seen as a safe store of value and inflation hedge.
Market participants are also betting that the Federal Reserve would hold off on raising borrowing costs this year, despite last week's upbeat U.S. jobs report. Interest rate futures are currently pricing in a 33% of a rate hike by December.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
A day earlier, gold sank $21.30, or 1.57%, its biggest daily loss in three months, as sharp gains in global equity markets dampened demand for the yellow metal.
The precious surged to a more than two-year high of $1,377.50 last week, as fears surrounding global growth in wake of Britain’s vote to exit the European Union sent investors flooding into safe haven assets.
However, uncertainty over the U.K.'s political scene diminished with the imminent appointment of Home Secretary Theresa May as U.K. prime minister.
May is set to be installed as the U.K.'s new prime minister by Wednesday evening London time, replacing David Cameron who resigned after the Brexit vote last month.
She said she plans to set up a new government department to lead the process of withdrawing the country from the European Union. However, it remains unclear when Article 50, which initiates the withdrawal process from the EU, will be triggered.

1298,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2016 08:20AM ET</span>",OPEC delegates say Saudi comments show higher oil price desire,"By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC delegates say comments from top exporter Saudi Arabia, which two years ago led the group to drop its historic role of supporting oil prices, are a change in tone and a sign the kingdom is looking - verbally for now - to prop up the market.
Khalid al-Falih, who took over this year from longserving Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told German newspaper Handelsblatt that an oil price higher than $50 is needed to achieve a balance in oil markets in the long term.
There is certainly no sign yet of an actual policy shift by Saudi Arabia, or of the kingdom cutting supplies to support prices. Indeed, Riyadh told OPEC it raised its output in June to within a whisker of a record high reached a year ago.
But OPEC insiders say Falih's comments, and a remark he made last month raising the possibility Saudi Arabia may return to its role of balancing oil supply and demand, contrasted with previous statements from Saudi oil officials.
""This a change in the Saudi position,"" an OPEC delegate from a major Middle East producer said of Falih's remarks. ""Before, they did not mention a range of prices they were looking for.""
""They are looking for a higher price, but they want a moderate price.""
In May, Saudi oil sources said the kingdom would not return to the old pattern of cutting output any time soon to support prices. Naimi frequently said prices were determined by the market, without giving a preferred range.
The optimum oil price, Falih told the paper, lies somewhere in between $50 and $100. 
Other delegates from the OPEC nations outside the Gulf, who had misgivings about OPEC's 2014 policy shift and would like higher prices, saw the Saudi minister's comments as a sign the kingdom may be wanting a stronger market.
""It's an indication,"" said a second OPEC delegate. ""Is this a function of their cost of production and budget requirements?""
OPEC oil revenues collapsed since its November 2014 policy shift accelerated a drop in prices, which hit a 12-year low near $27 a barrel in January and are trading close to $48 - half the level of two years ago.
A third delegate, from an OPEC country which wants the exporter group to work more actively toward supporting prices, was encouraged by the Saudi minister's remarks. 
""For sure, a decent price of oil is needed to have enough investment to avoid a supply crunch and a boom in prices a few years from now,"" this delegate said. 

""So let us hope for the best. It is good that the Saudis are realizing, but after a huge loss for oil exporters.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell on Wednesday as the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that a global supply glut continued to weigh on prices and data showed an unexpected weekly gain in U.S. crude stocks.
The IEA, which advises industrialized nations on energy policies, said crude inventories kept rising last month and pushed floating storage, one of the most expensive methods of stockpiling, to the highest level in seven years. 
""(Stocks) are at such elevated levels, especially for products for which demand growth is slackening, that they remain a major dampener on oil prices,"" the Paris-based IEA said in its latest report.
Stocks of U.S. crude and refined products rose unexpectedly last week by 2.2 million barrels, data from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, showed late on Tuesday.
This provided further bearish impetus to the market a day after prices had risen 5 percent, giving investors a chance to lock in gains.
The U.S. government's Energy Information Administration (EIA) releases official weekly inventory data at 1430 GMT on Wednesday.
Global benchmark Brent oil (LCOc1) was down 76 cents at $47.71 a barrel at 0850 GMT after settling up $2.22, or 4.8 percent, in the previous session.
U.S. crude (CLc1) traded at $46.20 a barrel, down 60 cents on Tuesday's close.
The U.S. dollar (DXY) rose, making dollar-denominated oil less attractive for holders of other currencies.
The IEA also raised its forecasts for 2016 and 2017 oil demand growth by 0.1 million barrels per day to 1.4 million bpd and 1.3 million bpd, respectively.
""Therefore any weakness based on the IEA report should be short-lived,"" said Tamas Varga, oil analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) raised its 2016 oil price forecasts on Wednesday. The bank forecast U.S. crude would average $43.59 per barrel this year versus $36.91 in its earlier forecast, and $55.00 for 2017, versus $52.88 earlier.

Brent will average $44.53 a barrel this year, up from $37.77, and average $56.25 in 2017, up from $54.25 earlier.

1302,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2016 05:15AM ET</span>",Huge stocks overhang threatens oil price recovery: IEA,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - The global glut in oil is refusing to ease and acts as a major dampener on crude prices despite robust demand growth and steep declines in non-OPEC production, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday.
The IEA, which coordinates the energy policies of industrial nations, said it had revised up its forecasts of 2016 and 2017 global oil demand growth by 0.1 million barrels per day from last month to 1.4 million and 1.3 million bpd respectively.
It said demand was growing thanks to good consumption in India, China and, surprisingly, Europe. 
""This (European demand growth) is unlikely to last, though, with the ongoing precariousness of the European economies now dealing with added uncertainty following the result of the UK referendum on membership of the European Union,"" it added.
Oil prices (LCOc1) slumped to their lowest in over a decade at $27 a barrel earlier this year from as high as $115 in 2014 after OPEC raised production to fight for market share against higher-cost producers such as the United States.
The slump forced many producers outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to curb output and prices recovered to around $50 in recent months, also supported by production outages in countries such as Nigeria and Canada.
But it was not enough to reduce the glut that had accumulated over the past two years. Commercial inventories in industrialized nations rose by 13.5 million barrels in May to a record high of 3.074 billion, the Paris-based IEA said.
Inventories kept building in June, pushing oil in floating storage - one of the most expensive methods of stockpiling - to its highest levels since 2009, the IEA said.
""Although market balance is upon us, the existence of very high oil stocks is a threat to the recent stability of oil prices,"" the IEA said.
""Although stocks are close to topping out, they are at such elevated levels, especially for products for which demand growth is slackening, that they remain a major dampener on oil prices"".
MIDDLE EAST GAINS MARKET SHARE
The IEA also said recent data suggested growth could be slowing in some key consuming nations.
In China, data for May suggested that year-on-year demand growth was only 130,000 bpd. In the United States, estimated gasoline deliveries in April were up just 75,000 bpd year-on-year, some 410,000 bpd below the IEA's expectations.
On the supply side, after a steep drop by 0.9 million bpd in non-OPEC production in 2016 to 56.5 million bpd, output is expected to recover modestly by 0.2 million bpd in 2017.
Meanwhile, OPEC crude output stood in June at an eight-year high of 33.21 million bpd with Saudi Arabia pumping at near-record rates of 10.45 million bpd and Nigerian flows partially recovering from rebel attacks. 
Iranian output rose to 3.66 million bpd in June, up 50,000 bpd on May and 750,000 bpd since the easing of Western sanctions at the start of the year. 

""As such, the Middle East’s market share of global oil supplies rose to 35 percent, the highest since the late 1970s and an eloquent reminder that even when U.S. shale production does resume its growth, older producers will remain essential for oil markets,"" the IEA said.

After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said that U.S. oil inventories rose by a surprising 2.2 million barrels in the week ended July 8. Gasoline stocks increased by 1.5 million barrels, while distillate inventories added 2.6 million barrels.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its weekly report on oil supplies at 14:30GMT, or 10:30AM ET, Wednesday amid expectations for a drop of 2.95 million barrels.
Gasoline stockpiles are expected to decline by 432,000 barrels while stocks of distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, are forecast to increase by 256,000 barrels, according to analysts.
Crude oil for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 51 cents, or 1.09%, to trade at $46.29 a barrel by 07:52GMT, or 3:52AM ET, after soaring $2.04, or 4.56%, a day earlier, amid a broad improvement in risk sentiment.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for September delivery dropped 60 cents, or 1.26%, to $47.87. On Tuesday, London-traded Brent futures surged $2.22, or 4.8%, its biggest daily gain since April 8.
Oil was boosted after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries forecast higher demand for its crude next year as the global surplus fades.
In its monthly market report published Tuesday, OPEC said that demand for crude from its own 14 members was expected to rise to average 33.0 million barrels per day in 2017, representing a gain of 1.1 million barrels per day over the current year.
Global oil demand will increase by 1.2 million barrels a day next year to reach an average of 95.3 million a day, with almost all of the growth concentrated in emerging economies such as India and China.
The rise in demand growth would come as rival non-OPEC supply continued to fall. Oil production outside OPEC will fall by 100,000 barrels a day to 55.9 million a day, as growth in Brazil and Canada is eclipsed by declines in Mexico, the U.S. and Norway, according to OPEC.
The International Energy Agency will release its own monthly report on global oil supply and demand later in the session.

1304,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2016 03:35AM ET</span>","As long as India's oil demand is driven by mopeds, it won't be the new China","By Sankalp Phartiyal and Nidhi Verma
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Sanjay Kumar is beaming with joy. The 23-year-old has just bought a used motor scooter, his first, for 30,000 rupees ($445), after years of saving together with his mother.
He says the Maestro Scooter by Indian motorbike maker Hero will let him ferry his mother for shopping trips as well as navigate New Delhi's chaotic roads between part-time jobs.
""We never had the kind of income to buy a vehicle. Now I can take my mother on my bike for local shopping, and work otherwise. I can easily cut down on my travel time and avoid congestions by using my scooter,"" he said.
Sanjay is one of millions of new motor scooter riders who have helped push the pace of India's oil demand growth well past China's. 
Yet as long as this growth is driven by mopeds, not cars, the oil industry's hopes that India will become a pillar of oil demand to match the giant Chinese market are set to be disappointed.
India's thirst for gasoline - the fuel most used by passenger vehicles - has soared 12.6 percent in the first six months of the year from 2015, growing at more than double the pace of China.
However, its overall gasoline consumption at around 544,000 barrels per day is less than a fifth of China's 2.8 million bpd.
At the core of India's fuel consumption growth are small motorbikes.
Some 16.5 million new units were sold in 2015/16, according to industry and manufacturing data, up from 11.8 million in 2010/2011, making it the world's second biggest sales market after China, which sold 24.6 million motorbikes last year.
New motorbike sales in India are expected to reach 19 million by 2018, said Roy Kurian, vice president for sales and marketing at Yamaha Motor India Sales.
NO NEW CHINA
But while India is catching China in motorbike sales, it lags far behind in cars, which use more petrol per journey.
Modern motorbikes have a fuel efficiency of over 100 miles per gallon (mpg). Older models may only reach around 50 mpg, but that's still about twice as efficient as most cars.
Sales of new four-wheeled passenger vehicles in China hit almost 25 million last year, double the volume in 2010.
India's car sales are measly by comparison. New passenger vehicle sales have stagnated below 3 million a year since 2010. Monthly sales of less than 215,000 are well below their historic peak of just over 300,000 half a decade ago.
India's poor roads and choked cities favor bikes over cars, but the most important factor is price.
India's average monthly salary of around $120 remains far below China's average of over $9,000 a year, making motorbikes the default choice for the swelling number of young commuters.
Small motorized two-wheelers cost 25,000 rupees to 50,000 rupees ($370 to $750) compared with 200,000 rupees to 500,000 rupees ($3,000 to $7,500) for the cheapest new cars.
India-based credit rating agency ICRA says the income levels of average Indians have risen 8-9 percent a year for the past five years. In a population where 65 percent of people are under 35, and where financing options are improving, this has supported the two-wheeler market.
""Commuting is a basic necessity, (but) in metropolitan areas and cities we have a public transport system that is not good enough,"" said Yamaha's Kurian.
""Two-wheelers have become an automatic choice because of the traffic chaos and parking issues in almost every city,"" he said, adding that a lack of public transport and poor roads outside cities were also boosting sales in rural India.

(Story corrects to add 'a year' in 16th graf to make clear the figure shown is China's average annual salary.)

1305,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 13, 2016 02:50AM ET</span>",Gold turns higher after hitting 2-week low,"Investing.com - Gold inched higher in European trade on Wednesday, as investors went bargain-hunting after prices of the precious metal fell to a two-week low overnight.
Gold for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange slumped to an intraday low of $1,328.10 a troy ounce, a level not seen since July 1. It last traded at $1,341.65 by 06:49GMT, or 2:49AM ET, up $6.35, or 0.48%.
A day earlier, gold sank $21.30, or 1.57%, its biggest daily loss in three months, as sharp gains in global equity markets dampened demand for the yellow metal.
Gold surged to a more than two-year high of $1,377.50 last week, as uncertainty surrounding global growth in wake of Britain’s vote to exit the European Union sent investors flooding into safe haven assets.
However, uncertainty over the U.K.'s political scene diminished with the imminent appointment of Home Secretary Theresa May as U.K. prime minister. May is set to be installed as prime minister by Wednesday evening, replacing David Cameron who resigned after the Brexit vote last month.
She said she plans to set up a new government department to lead the process of withdrawing the country from the European Union. However, it remains unclear when May will trigger Article 50, which initiates the withdrawal process from the EU.
Prices of the yellow metal are up nearly 27% so far this year amid fading expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike and as expectations mounted that central banks around the world will step up monetary stimulus to counteract the negative economic shock from the Brexit vote.
Two senior Fed officials said Tuesday that despite last week's better-than-expected U.S. nonfarm payroll data, the central bank should be in no rush to raise interest rates.
Market players awaited comments from a barrage of Fed officials later in the session to judge the balance of opinion among policymakers on the prospect of further rate hikes.
Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan is due to speak on the world economy at the World Affairs Council of Houston at 13:00GMT, or 9:00AM ET. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also scheduled to deliver comments later in the day.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for September delivery climbed 29.1 cents, or 1.44%, to trade at $20.46 a troy ounce during morning hours in London, while copper futures advanced 3.9 cents, or 1.76%, to $2.252 a pound.

1306,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2016 02:20AM ET</span>","No balance: oil markets still oversupplied, now growth is stuttering","By Henning Gloystein
SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil industry hopes that markets are about return to balance, ending a global glut that pulled down prices by over 70 percent between 2014 and early 2016, might be abruptly dashed.
Despite recent disruptions and output cuts, there is mounting evidence that plentiful supplies and brimming inventories will delay a much-quoted rebalancing of oil markets.
""The market needs to stop worrying about this balance and concentrate on the now,"" said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services in Dubai.
""We rallied on the back of supply outages, wildfires and seemingly increased demand. Well, Shell (LON:RDSa) have lifted force majeure at (Nigeria's) Bonny ... the wildfires are out and Canada is close to full production, and (U.S.) gasoline demand is at 15-month lows,"" he added.
Not just are supplies improving, now demand may be waning.
With the United States and Europe stagnating, Asia has been the main pillar of oil demand growth. But that too is now stuttering, with tanker flows into the region down for four straight months, Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows.
One indicator of a continuing glut is the shape of the forward crude oil futures curve <0#LCO:>, which has been in contango for much of this year, meaning that oil for sale at a later date is more expensive than that for immediate delivery.
This makes it attractive for traders to store oil for sale later and is seen as a key sign of oversupply.
In fact, so much oil is now stored that the world is running out of space, forcing traders to charter supertankers in which to keep unsold fuel.
There is so much oil in storage that it could take well into 2018 for the glut to clear. 
""There are still excess stocks on the market – hundreds of millions of barrels of surplus oil. It will take a long time to reduce this inventory overhang,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told a German newspaper.
While headline figures such as Chinese car sales and gross domestic growth (GDP) remain strong, both have slumped most of this year. China's new passenger vehicle sales, while still huge at over 2 million per month, have fallen by a quarter since reaching their December peak.
Counting on a continuing boom, China's oil refiners are producing so much fuel that even its huge domestic market can't cope, resulting in a surge of Chinese fuel exports into an already glutted Asian market.
Furthermore, China's program to build up strategic petroleum reserves (SPR), a strong source of crude demand over the past years, may slow sharply or even halt soon, as its available storage facilities are full or close to capacity.
As a result, U.S. bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) expects a ""15 percent month-on-month decline in China's crude imports in September.""
The impact on oil consumption of Britain's vote to leave the European Union is likely to delay the supply/demand rebalancing further, probably by six months.
INDIA NOT THE NEW CHINA
The U.S. Energy Department cut its forecast for oil demand growth in 2016, and increased its demand growth forecast for 2017, according to a monthly outlook issued on Tuesday.
U.S. oil demand is expected to grow 160,000 barrels per day in 2016, compared with previous expectations for 220,000 bpd, according to the department. Demand will grow 120,000 bpd in 2017, compared with 60,000 bpd previously.
""It doesn't look as though we'll put much of a dent in global (oil) inventories until the second half of 2017,"" said Tim Evans, energy futures specialist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
""The market is making considerable progress relative to the surplus of the past two years, but it's going to take more time to bring inventories back down to more normal levels,"" he added.
Many in the oil industry hope India will pick up the baton from China and act as the global driver for oil demand growth.
Yet such hopes are premature as India remains, for the time being, too poor to get anywhere near China's fuel consumption.
While its demand may now be growing faster than China's, its outright consumption remains far lower, as seen in vehicle sales.
India sells some 16 million motor bikes per year, similar to China. Yet in China, some 2 million new passenger vehicles hit the road every single month (25 million in 2015), up from around one million just five years ago.
In India, by contrast, car sales have stagnated between 200,000 and 300,000 per month for years, and never recovered from their historic peak of just over 300,000 reached in 2011.
Meanwhile, Asia's two most developed major economies, Japan and South Korea, are grappling with a steady and likely terminal decline in oil demand.
Some pin their hopes on Southeast Asia, where large emerging markets such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia have huge potential. But like India, the region still lags China in terms of development for it to act as a substitute.
In short, the sort of fuel demand growth seen in Asia over the past decade may be a thing of the past.
While few expect the region's demand to fall outright, many say the oil industry needs to adjust to a future of lower Asian growth just like the coal and steel industry has had to.

Again, the automobile sector provides a clue. ""Car sales in Asia, including in China, are falling amid economic downturn,"" Tae-nyen Kim, executive managing director of Korea Automobile Association, told Reuters.

U.S. stocks opened at record-highs, as the Dow surged more than 100 points to an intra-session high of 18,353.76, eclipsing the previous all-time intraday high of 18,351.36 from last May. Since tumbling by more than 850 points over a two-day, post-Brexit sell-off, the Dow has rallied approximately 1,300 points during the massive global equities rally. At the same time, the S&P 500 Composite index reached fresh intraday highs for the second consecutive session, while the NASDAQ Composite index erased all of its losses on the calendar year.
Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis president James Bullard reiterated his position that current economic conditions deem it appropriate for the U.S. central bank to raise short-term rates only once over the next two years. While delivering a speech in St. Louis, Bullard noted that a flattening yield curve from plummeting long-term U.S. Treasury yields does not necessarily imply signals of an imminent recession. In the wake of last month's Brexit decision, government bond yields worldwide, including those on U.S. 10-Year and 30-Year Treasuries have plunged to all-time record lows.
""Wall Street is taking it as a signal that growth is slowing. I think it is a flight to safety following the Brexit shock,"" Bullard said. ""That is driving yields down and I would not take it as a signal of U.S. growth prospects.""
Despite Bullard's dovish position, analysts from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:NYSE:GS) said Tuesday they still anticipate that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will ""return to hiking rates,"" before long. Following a relatively strong U.S. employment report for the month of June, the Fed Futures Rate for a single rate hike in 2016 increased to 32.7% on Tuesday, up from 12% before last Friday's release.
Investors who are bullish on gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.

The American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude supplies rose by a surprise 2.2 million barrels for the week ended July 8, according to sources. The Energy Information Administration report on U.S. crude and refined product stocks will be released Wednesday.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for August delivery eased 0.56% to $46.54 a barrel. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for September delivery fell 0.72% to $48.12 a barrel.
Overnight, crude futures surged more than 4%, bouncing from near two-month lows, after OPEC predicted in its first 2017 forecast that the demand for global oil will exceed production levels of crude next year, helping ease investors' sentiments regarding the long-term implications of a massive supply glut on worldwide energy markets.
In its monthly Oil Market Report for June, released on Tuesday, OPEC said its crude oil production averaged 32.86 million barrel per day in June, representing an increase of 264,000 bpd from the prior month. Although output increased among a host of producers such as Nigeria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Libya and UAE, production dipped considerably in Venezuela and Iraq. Oil production in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, rose by 66,500 bpd to 10.308 million bpd. The assessment also factored in the return of Gabon to the powerful oil cartel, adding an extra 214,000 bpd to June's total.
Notably, OPEC anticipates that world demand will increase by 1.2 million bpd next year to 95.3 million bpd, outpacing current supply estimates. OPEC also forecasts that world supply will fall sharply by 1.4 million bpd to 94.3 million bpd during the current three-month period, providing significant pressure to the upside. Additionally, the cartel anticipates that Non-OPEC supply will inch down from current 2016 forecasts of 56.0 million bpd to 55.9 million bpd by the end of next year.
""The contraction seen this year in non-OPEC supply is expected to continue in 2017 but at a slower pace,"" OPEC said in the report. ""Market conditions will help remove overall excess oil stocks in 2017.""
OPEC also attributed a 40% increase in the average price of its Reference Basket during the second quarter to widespread production slowdowns in Nigeria and Canada, as well as the determined recovery of markets in the wake of the Brexit referendum. The massive rebound marked OPEC's largest quarterly spike on record.
""With ongoing supply disruptions around the world seeming to provide a floor to prices, international crude futures rose on both sides of the Atlantic in June, shrugging off the results of the UK’s referendum on EU membership,"" OPEC added.
Crude prices have still fallen sharply over the last two years from their peak of $115 a barrel in June, 2014. Months later, OPEC rattled global markets with a surprising decision to maintain its production ceiling above 30 million, abandoning its strategy for favoring price increases over market share. The tactic triggered a prolonged battle with U.S. shale producers for market control, flooding energy markets with excessive supply.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2016 07:41PM ET</span>",Chambroad boss takes cues from Confucius to manage teapot boom,"By Chen Aizhu
BOXING, China (Reuters) - For Ma Yunsheng, taking care of Mum and Dad is not just a part of doing business, but the key to its success. 
Every month, the parents of workers at China's Chambroad Holding, an $8 billion oil refining and petrochemical company, get 200 yuan ($30), if their child is an ordinary worker, or up to 10 percent of their managerial offspring's salary.
The manager's parents also receive free apartments and access to elder care facilities within walking distance of their homes in Boxing, a town of 500,000 people in eastern China's Shandong province, where Chambroad is headquartered.
Chambroad's Chairman Ma Yunsheng, 53, looked to the deeply-held traditional Chinese value of filial piety, or respect for one's parents, in instituting these perks, he told Reuters in an interview. This corporate culture, rooted in the teachings of Chinese scholar Confucius, has driven Chambroad's ten-fold growth in revenue over the past decade to 50 billion yuan ($7.51 billion) in 2015, he said.
""The priority of Chambroad's management thinking goes to its staff first, then the local government, then its shareholders,"" said Ma, who in 1995 took over the small lubricant oil plant that Chambroad started out as in 1990. He became chairman when the company was privatised in 2000.
Speaking from his office adorned with Chinese calligraphy, Ma, an avid calligrapher himself, said Chambroad aims to become a century-old brand by following the same golden rule used during the past two decades.
From that lubes plant, Chambroad has expanded to running a 70,000 barrels-per-day oil refinery, producing petrochemicals and managing property. Chambroad is among over 20 private refining firms that China's government gave crude import licenses to starting in 2015, making them the stars of the global oil market as they snapped up Russia, North Sea and South American supply. 
However, Ma plans to steer Chambroad away from its roots as an independent refiner, called ""teapots"" because of their relative smaller size. Investments will go toward fuel retailing, logistics, and the production of high-quality chemical precursor materials, setting its sights on profitability rather than turnover.
""Longer-term refining will be in surplus...instead of expanding capacity, we'll be looking for the right partners to invest in,"" he said.
CONFUCIAN VALUES
Ma's ambitions to turn Chambroad into a research and development center to train other Chinese private firms have materialised in the brick-and-wood Chambroad Institute next to his office. It houses a 500-strong research team studying subjects from basic chemicals to waste treatment.
Ma said he measures how well Chambroad is performing through a combination of profit and tax rate paid back to the government. At this point that target is about 30 percent of revenues for the group that employs about 12,000 people.
Other perks Ma has instituted to drive performance include granting Chambroad's 109 top managers a 500,000 yuan car allowance, paid out monthly. Mid-level managers receive 250,000 yuan, a Chambroad spokeswoman said.
Chambroad staff said Ma likes to hire outside the company and bestows a lot of trust in new hires. This is unique for private Chinese businesses where most bosses tend to turn the companies into family operations.
""Chambroad won't be a family business...it will be five or more groups. My mission will be complete if each of them can run independently or form an alliance,"" said Ma, adding that he hones his management skills while deliberating during sleepless nights.
Ma also poses management questions to an internal social media group called ""West Point of the 80s"" for Chambroad employees born during that decade.
In an industry where alcohol is commonly imbibed at meetings, Chambroad tries to be a role model by banning drinking during weekdays for staff. 

Following the Confucian value that a leader has obligations to his followers, Ma slapped himself with a penalty of 300,000 yuan for drinking spirits over a dinner with local government officials.

1313,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 12, 2016 10:34AM ET</span>",Natural gas futures struggle as forecasts point to mild July weather,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures were lower for the second straight session on Tuesday, extending losses from the previous day as updated weather forecasting models pointed to mild temperatures across most parts of the U.S. in the weeks ahead.
Natural gas for delivery in August on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 1.3 cents, or 0.48%, to trade at $2.689 per million British thermal units by 14:33GMT, or 10:33AM ET.
A day earlier, natural gas futures declined 9.9 cents, or 3.53%, as warm temperatures in key U.S. gas-consumption regions gave way to cooler readings.
Demand for natural gas tends to fluctuate in the summer based on hot weather and air conditioning use.
Natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 39 billion cubic feet last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, below forecasts for an increase of 43 billion. That compared with builds of 37 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 87 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 77 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.179 trillion cubic feet, 16.9% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 18.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
Despite recent losses, prices are still up nearly 45% since late May as expectations have grown that hot summer weather will lead to heavy demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
In the week ahead, market players will be focusing on weekly U.S. storage data on Thursday for fresh supply-and-demand signals. Some analysts believe this week’s storage addition will be less than usual for this time of year due to a recent burst of warmer-than-normal summer weather across most parts of the U.S.

1315,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2016 09:35AM ET</span>","OPEC sees tighter 2017 oil market, Brexit drag on economy","By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC on Tuesday gave an upbeat outlook for the oil market in 2017, saying global demand for its crude would be higher than its current production and pointing to a supply deficit rather than a sizeable surplus that has weighed on prices.
However, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in a monthly report also cut its forecast for world economic growth this year, citing increased uncertainty following Britain's vote to leave the European Union and said the pace of oil demand growth would slow slightly next year, in its first 2017 forecast.
""After the UK's referendum to leave the EU, economic uncertainty has increased,"" OPEC said in the report. ""Potential negative effects have led to a downward revision of global economic growth in 2016 to 3.0 percent from 3.1 percent.""
Other forecasters including the International Monetary Fund have cut economic growth outlooks following the UK referendum. Concern about the economic impact of Brexit has weighed on oil prices, which at $47 a barrel (LCOc1) have fallen from a 2016 high close to $53 in early June.
World oil demand will rise by 1.15 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, OPEC said, its first forecast for next year in the monthly report. That marks a slight slowdown from growth of 1.19 million bpd expected in 2016.
Oil prices have halved from two years ago in a drop that deepened after OPEC refused in late 2014 to cut output to support prices, hoping that cheaper oil would curb higher-cost rival supply such as U.S. shale.
Despite a ""dampening effect"" of Brexit on the world economy next year, OPEC's 2017 market outlook suggests the strategy is working as it expects oil supply outside the group to fall further, helping to boost demand for its own crude.
OPEC forecasts supply from outside producers will decline by 110,000 bpd in 2017 after an 880,000-bpd drop this year. The price drop since 2014 has hit non-OPEC supply as companies have delayed or canceled projects around the world.
Oil output from OPEC, adjusted to include returning member Gabon, rose 264,000 bpd to 32.86 million bpd in June, OPEC said. It expects demand for its crude in 2017 to average 32.98 million bpd, suggesting a supply deficit if OPEC keeps output steady.
Top exporter Saudi Arabia told OPEC it raised output to 10.55 million bpd in June. The kingdom said it pumped 10.56 million bpd, a record, in June last year.
OPEC's report points to a sizeable average surplus of 1 million bpd this year, but also to demand for its crude exceeding current production in the third quarter. The last full quarter when OPEC pumped less than demand for its crude was in 2013, according to past OPEC reports. 
""The contraction seen this year in non-OPEC supply is expected to continue in 2017 but at a slower pace,"" OPEC said. ""Market conditions will help remove overall excess oil stocks in 2017.""

Others say it may take until 2018 to erode the excess supply in the market, which they put at 300 million barrels or more.

In its monthly market report published earlier, OPEC said that demand for crude from its own 14 members was expected to rise to average 33.0 million barrels per day in 2017, representing a gain of 1.1 million barrels per day over the current year.
Output from OPEC’s 14 nations increased by 264,100 barrels a day to 32.858 million a day in June, according to external sources cited by the report.
Global oil demand will increase by 1.2 million barrels a day next year to reach an average of 95.3 million a day, with almost all of the growth concentrated in emerging economies such as India and China.
The rise in demand growth would come as rival non-OPEC supply continued to fall. Oil production outside OPEC will fall by 100,000 barrels a day to 55.9 million a day, as growth in Brazil and Canada is eclipsed by declines in Mexico, the U.S. and Norway, according to OPEC.

According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by 10 last week to 351, marking the fifth increase in six weeks.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.
Market players now looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products. The American Petroleum Institute will release its inventories report later in the day, while Wednesday’s government report could show crude stockpiles fell by 3.2 million barrels.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil futures bounced back from two-month lows on Tuesday, helped by a weaker dollar, but a global stocks overhang and a drop in bullish bets by investors still weighed on prices.
Brent crude was at $46.93 per barrel at 0853 GMT, up 68 cents or 1.5 percent from the last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 58 cents at $45.34 a barrel.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Tuesday the oil industry needed a price above $50 per barrel to sustain investments but added that downward pressure would prevail because of an inventory glut.
""We need a price higher than $50 to achieve balance in oil markets in the long term,"" Falih told German business daily Handelsblatt.
""But there are still excess stocks on the market – hundreds of millions of barrels of surplus oil. It will take a long time to reduce this inventory overhang,"" he added.
Oil prices fell to a two-month low on Monday on renewed oversupply fears. The dollar index dropped 0.5 percent on Tuesday, helping to lift commodity prices. 
A brief suspension of tanker loading in Iraq and conflicting reports of new attacks in Nigeria also bolstered prices.
On the downside, a Reuters poll showed that China's economic growth likely cooled to a seven-year low in the second quarter as the industrial sector lost steam and a boost from financial services faded.
China's top oil firm CNPC said it saw the country's oil consumption rising to 670 million tonnes by 2027 from 520 million in 2014, implying annual growth of just 2 percent.
Hedge funds cutting their exposure to oil prices have also contributed to bearish sentiment, resulting in a 12 percent fall in Brent prices from their June peak above $52 per barrel.
""Oil prices could rally each time macro sentiment recovers on expectations of yet another round of quantitative easing, but for now the path of least resistance seems to be lower in the near term,"" said analyst Virendra Chauhan from Energy Aspects, which cut its third-quarter Brent forecast to $52 from $55.

Physical markets were weak, with Asian refiners processing less crude as they grapple with margins that plunged to five-year lows as refined products flooded the region.

""We need a price higher than $50 to achieve a balance in oil markets in the long term,"" Falih, who took over earlier this year from veteran Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told German business daily Handelsblatt.
""And just as $50 is too low to sustain investment, prices in excess of $100 are too much. The optimum lies somewhere in between,"" he said.
Falih said the oil markets were rebalancing thanks to output drops in countries such as the United States but it would take a long time before balance was achieved.
""We have seen a decrease in supply by roughly one million barrels of crude oil per day,"" he said, referring to output in the United States and Canada.
""At the same time, demand has recovered, meaning that supply and demand are now more balanced again. But there are still excess stocks on the market – hundreds of millions of barrels of surplus oil. It will take a long time to reduce this inventory overhang.""

Losses were limited amid speculation central banks in some of the world’s leading economies will step up monetary stimulus in the near-term to counteract the negative economic shock from the Brexit vote.
The Bank of England could potentially cut borrowing costs and add to its asset-purchase program when it meets this week.
Meanwhile, in Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe flagged a fresh fiscal stimulus package on Monday after his ruling coalition won a landslide victory in the Upper House on Sunday. The coalition’s firmer grip means policymakers can more easily approve a bigger fiscal stimulus package to spur the economy. A stimulus package of at least 10 trillion yen ($97.9 billion) is expected.
Expectations of monetary stimulus tend to benefit gold, as the metal is seen as a safe store of value and inflation hedge.
Market participants are also betting that the Federal Reserve would hold off on raising borrowing costs this year, despite last week's upbeat U.S. jobs report. Interest rate futures are currently pricing in just a 24% of a rate hike by December.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.

Over the last six months, U.S. crude output has moved lower in 23 of the last 24 weeks to fall to its lowest level since May, 2014. By comparison, weekly output in the U.S. eclipsed 9.4 million bpd 13 months ago, hitting its highest level in 44 years.
At the end of 2040, the EIA expects tight oil production associated with shale extraction to eclipse 7.0 million bpd. Next year, however, the Energy Department estimates that the figure could drop as low as 4.1 million bpd.
While U.S. crude output has fallen rapidly in recent months, gasoline and diesel markets continue to be saturated by oversupply, amid signals of extreme overproduction by refiners nationwide.

Overnight, gold closed virtually flat on Monday in choppy trade, as Shinzo Abe's landslide victory in Japan and the likelihood of Theresa May's appointment as David Cameron's replacement in the U.K. helped reduce global political uncertainty, offsetting the rising probability of further easing measures by top central banks worldwide.
In Japan, equities surged almost 4% while the yen weakened sharply after Abe promised to move ahead with a raft of major constitutional reforms following his party's landslide victory in upper-house elections over the weekend. As part of his plans, the Japanese prime minister unveiled a ¥10 Trillion ($98 billion) stimulus measure aimed at jumpstarting the economy, including a proposal to fast-track construction on a series of high-speed trains throughout the nation.
While the Nikkei 225 soared 601.84 or 3.98% to 15,708.82, the Yen fell considerably against the U.S. Dollar on prospects that Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and their junior colleagues in the house could approve the fiscal stimulus.

Gold is viewed as a hedge for investors in periods of heightened volatility on global equity markets.
Market players also reacted to improved odds for a 2016 rate hike from the Federal Reserve in the wake of Friday's robust U.S. employment report. On Monday, the CME Group's (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool increased the probability of a December rate hike to 30.1%, up from 22.5% at the end of Friday's session. Before the release, the odds of a single rate hike by the Fed in 2016 stood at 12%. In addition, Kansas City Fed president Esther George, a noted hawk, told a management conference in Missouri that the rebound in the labor market last month could compel her to resume a push for advocating an imminent rate hike.
Investors who are bullish on gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.

At the end of 2040, the EIA expects tight oil production associated with shale extraction to eclipse 7.0 million bpd. Next year, however, the Energy Department estimates that the figure could drop as low as 4.1 million bpd.
While U.S. crude output has fallen rapidly in recent months, gasoline and diesel markets continue to be saturated by oversupply, amid signals of extreme overproduction by refiners nationwide. The spike in gasoline production, combined with weakening demand in Asia and other key markets could provide significant downside pressure for crude prices, according to analysts.

1329,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 11, 2016 01:33PM ET</span>","Gold remains near 2-year high, even as global political outlook improves","Investing.com -- Gold closed virtually flat on Monday in choppy trade, as Shinzo Abe's landslide victory in Japan and the likelihood of Theresa May's appointment as David Cameron's replacement in the U.K. helped reduce global political uncertainty, offsetting the rising probability of further easing measures by top central banks worldwide.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded between $1,352.00 and $1,376.40 an ounce, before settling at $1,356.95, down 1.45 or 0.11% on the session. Over the weekend, gold ticked up to fresh 28-month highs at $1,376.40, extending modest gains from the prior week. While Gold retreated slightly over the final two sessions of last week, the precious metal still posted its sixth consecutive weekly gain amid widespread concerns of extreme volatility on global financial markets. Since opening the year around $1,075 an ounce, Gold has surged approximately 30% over the first seven months of 2016.
Gold likely gained support at $1,323.50, the low from June 8 and was met with resistance at $1,391.40 the high from March 17, 2014.
In Japan, equities surged almost 4% while the Yen weakened sharply after Abe promised to move ahead with a raft of major constitutional reforms following his party's landslide victory in upper-house elections over the weekend. As part of his plans, the Japanese prime minister unveiled a ¥10 Trillion ($98 billion) stimulus measure aimed at jumpstarting the economy, including a proposal to fast-track construction on a series of high-speed trains throughout the nation.
While the Nikkei 225 soared 601.84 or 3.98% to 15,708.82, the Yen fell considerably against the U.S. Dollar on prospects that Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and their junior colleagues in the house could approve the fiscal stimulus. In U.S. afternoon trading, USD/JPY jumped 2.10 or 2.09% to 102.69, remaining on pace for its strongest one-day move since late-April.
Elsewhere, investors kept a close eye on political developments in the U.K. after Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the closely-watched Prime Minister campaign, leaving May as the lone candidate to succeed Cameron. May's appointment on Wednesday could augment Britain's chances of gaining access to the European Union's single market, strengthening the Pound and soothing investor's concerns throughout the euro area.
GBP/USD rallied upon the news, briefly eclipsing 1.30 before falling back to 1.2973 in the U.S. afternoon session. The Pound Sterling has lingered around 31-year lows against the Dollar since voters in the U.K. surprisingly approved a measure paving the way for a British departure from the EU in late-June.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 0.40% to an intraday high of 96.81.

The S&P 500 Composite index soared to an intraday high of 2,143.16 in broad risk-on trade, jumping to its highest intra-session level on record. Investors brace for the start of the second quarter earnings period on Monday when  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) releases its quarterly results after the close of trading. The S&P last set an intra-day record on May 20, 2015 when it hit session highs of 2,134.72.
Gold is viewed as a hedge for investors in periods of heightened volatility on global equity markets.
Market players also reacted to improved odds for a 2016 rate hike from the Federal Reserve in the wake of Friday's robust U.S. employment report. On Monday, the CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool increased the probability of a December rate hike to 30.1%, up from 22.5% at the end of Friday's session. Before the release, the odds of a single rate hike by the Fed in 2016 stood at 12%. In addition, Kansas City Fed president Esther George, a noted hawk, told a management conference in Missouri that the rebound in the labor market last month could compel her to resume a push for advocating an imminent rate hike.
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.

Natural gas for delivery in August on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 1.9 cents, or 0.68%, to trade at $2.781 per million British thermal units by 14:33GMT, or 10:33AM ET.
Last week, natural gas futures declined 11.4 cents, or 6.23%, snapping a six-week win streak, as warm temperatures in key U.S. gas-consumption regions gave way to cooler readings.
Natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 39 billion cubic feet last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, below forecasts for an increase of 43 billion. That compared with builds of 37 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 87 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 77 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.179 trillion cubic feet, 16.9% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 18.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
Despite recent losses, prices are still up nearly 45% since late May as expectations have grown that hot summer weather will lead to heavy demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
In the week ahead, market players will be focusing on weekly U.S. storage data on Thursday for fresh supply-and-demand signals. Some analysts believe this week’s storage addition will be less than usual for this time of year due to a recent burst of warmer-than-normal summer weather across most parts of the U.S.

Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by 10 last week to 351, marking the fifth increase in six weeks.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.
New York-traded oil futures sank $3.70, or 7.31%, last week, its biggest weekly loss in almost six months.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for September delivery tacked on 19 cents, or 0.41%, to $46.95, after sliding to a session low of $45.90, the weakest since May 11.
Last week, London-traded Brent futures dropped $3.84, or 7.13%, its worst weekly performance since mid-January, amid growing anxiety over the economic impact of Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
The news sparked concerns that Europe will fall back into recession, putting more pressure on the global economy and undermining future oil demand prospects.

Britain's vote to leave the European Union last month has ramped up the urgency for central banks around the world to ease monetary policy in the near-term to counteract the negative economic shock from the Brexit vote.
The Bank of England could potentially cut borrowing costs and add to its asset-purchase program when it meets this week.
Meanwhile, in Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe flagged a fresh fiscal stimulus package after his ruling coalition won a landslide victory in the Upper House on Sunday.
The coalition’s firmer grip means policymakers can more easily approve a bigger fiscal stimulus package to spur the economy. A stimulus package of at least 10 trillion yen ($97.9 billion) is expected.
Expectations of monetary stimulus tend to benefit gold, as the metal is seen as a safe store of value and inflation hedge.
Market participants are also betting that the Federal Reserve would hold off on raising interest rates this year.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
Gold for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to a session high of $1,376.50 a troy ounce, less than $1.00 away from a more than two-year high hit last week. It last stood at $1,356.10 by 12:45GMT, or 8:45AM ET, down $2.25, or 0.17%.
Gold surged to $1,377.50 last week, a level not seen since March 2014, as uncertainty surrounding global growth in wake of Britain’s vote to exit the European Union sent investors flooding into safe haven assets.
Prices of the yellow metal are up nearly 30% so far this year amid fading expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike and as expectations mounted that central banks around the world will step up monetary stimulus to counteract the negative economic shock from the Brexit vote.

China published weaker than expected inflation data over the weekend, reinforcing views that more government stimulus steps will be needed to support the economy.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell on Monday over signs that U.S. shale drillers have adapted to lower prices and on renewed indications of economic weakness in Asia where refiners are already trimming crude runs.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was trading at $46.43 per barrel at 1205 GMT, down 33 cents from its last settlement. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) was down 30 cents at $45.11 a barrel.
Physical markets were also under pressure. Rising Canadian oil flows are having difficulty finding space in pipelines, weighing on Canadian prices.
Iran set the official selling price of its light grade for Asia at $0.45 above the Oman/Dubai average for August, down 40 cents on the month.
Traders said the lower prices were a result of Asian refiners beginning to cut crude orders, and also due to the region's economic slowdown.
""Economic run cuts are finally starting in a few markets, but more may be needed,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
Several Asian refiners are maintaining or reducing crude throughput in July and August after refineries around the region in the first quarter binged on the cheapest crude in over a decade.
China's economic growth likely cooled to a fresh seven-year low of 6.6 percent in the second quarter, according to a Reuters poll of 61 economists, its weakest in seven years. 
An oil pipeline leak at Iraq's southern port of Basra has been repaired and pumping has resumed without affecting exports, the Iraqi oil ministry said on Monday.
Basra Light crude oil loading had been suspended at two export terminals in Iraq's main oil export port, shipping and trade sources said earlier in the day.
Crude exports in August from Iraq's southern ports are set to fall to 2.79 million barrels per day (bpd) from 2.99 million bpd planned for July, according to a preliminary loading programme.
U.S. investment bank Jefferies sees the oil market establishing a solid base for higher prices ahead and forecasts prices at $70 a barrel by late 2017/early 2018. 
""We believe that the oil market is in the early stages of a sustainable but protracted recovery."" 
""Supply/demand balances will transition to balance and then under-supply in the back half of 2016,"" the bank said, but warned that prices may not fully react to under-supply until inventories draw to more ""normal levels"". 

Evidence that U.S. producers can live with crude of $45 or higher came as drillers added rigs for the fifth week in six, U.S. oil bankruptcies became sparse in June, and bullish U.S. oil bets dropped to near four-month lows.

Khalid al-Falih said Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, would always strive to stabilize the oil market, a statement by the energy ministry said on Sunday. 
""In doing so, the Kingdom secures the flow of oil supplies as it retains a spare production capacity,"" the minister, attending a climate meeting in Berlin, was quoted as saying in the statement. 

His remarks echo earlier comments made on Monday by the Saudi minister in the Saudi city of Dhahran at a meeting with newly appointed OPEC secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo.

1341,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 10, 2016 06:33AM ET</span>",Gold / Silver / Copper futures - weekly outlook: July 11 - 15,"Investing.com - Gold prices declined on Friday, after data showed that the U.S. economy added the most jobs in eight months in June, but losses were limited as tepid wage growth suggested the Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates anytime soon.
Gold for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange sank to a session low of $1,336.30 a troy ounce immediately after the jobs data, before trimming losses to settle at $1,358.40 by close of trade, down $3.70, or 0.27%.
The U.S. Department of Labor said the economy added 287,000 jobs in June, blowing past expectations for 175,000 and the largest gain since October. May's payroll count was revised down to only an 11,000 increase from the previously reported 38,000.
The report also showed that the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.9% last month from 4.7% in May, compared to expectations for a rise to 4.8%.
Meanwhile, average hourly earnings rose 0.1% last month, disappointing expectations for a 0.2% gain. This lack of inflationary pressure implies that the Fed can still wait to move on interest rates.
Markets remained skeptical about the odds of a rate hike this year. The CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool is currently pricing in just a 24% of a rate hike by December. Odds for a June 2017 rate increase stood at around 35%.
According to the minutes of the Fed's June policy meeting released on Wednesday, policymakers decided that interest rate hikes should stay on hold until they have a handle on the consequences of Britain's vote on European Union membership. The minutes added that officials agreed that it was “prudent to wait” for additional data before considering another rate hike.
For the week, gold futures tacked on $14.40, or 1.49%, the sixth straight weekly gain. Prices surged to $1,377.50 on Wednesday, a level not seen since March 2014, as uncertainty surrounding global growth in wake of Britain’s vote to exit the EU sent investors flooding into safe haven assets.
Prices of the yellow metal are up nearly 30% so far this year. Gold has been well-supported in recent weeks amid fading expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike in the next couple of months and as expectations mounted that central banks around the world will step up monetary stimulus to counteract the negative economic shock from the Brexit vote.
Expectations of monetary stimulus tend to benefit gold, as the metal is seen as a safe store of value and inflation hedge.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for September delivery jumped 26.1 cents, or 1.32%, on Friday to settle at $20.09 a troy ounce. On the week, silver futures advanced 30.3 cents, or 2.63%, the sixth consecutive weekly gain.
Elsewhere in metals trading, copper for September delivery dipped 0.4 cents, or 0.21%, on Friday to end at $2.119 a pound. For the week, New York-traded copper prices tumbled 11.0 cents, or 4.33%, snapping a three-week win streak.
In the week ahead, market players will be turning their attention to key economic data out of China, with Friday’s second quarter GDP report in the spotlight.
Thursday’s rate decision and monetary policy meeting minutes from the Bank of England will also be in focus, amid mountings expectations for additional stimulus in wake of the U.K.’s Brexit vote.

On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for September delivery fell to an intraday low of $46.15 a barrel, a level not seen since May 11, before recovering to settle at $46.76 by close of trade, up 36 cents, or 0.78%.
Despite Friday’s gains, London-traded Brent futures dropped $3.84, or 7.13%, on the week, its worst weekly performance since mid-January, amid growing anxiety over the economic impact of Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
The news sparked concerns that Europe will fall back into recession, putting more pressure on the global economy and undermining future oil demand prospects.
Elsewhere, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil  for delivery in August advanced 27 cents, or 0.6%, to end at $45.41 a barrel, after slumping to $44.77 earlier in the session, the lowest since May 11.
For the week, New York-traded oil futures sank $3.70, or 7.31%, its biggest weekly loss in almost six months, amid signs of an ongoing recovery in U.S. drilling activity.
Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by 10 last week to 351, marking the fifth increase in six weeks.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude oil inventories declined by a less-than-expected 2.2 million barrels last week to 524.4 million, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year”.
In the week ahead, oil traders will be focusing on U.S. stockpile data on Tuesday and Wednesday for fresh supply-and-demand signals.
Meanwhile, investors will keep an eye out for monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency to gauge global supply and demand levels.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude prices inched up in choppy trading on Friday but Brent notched its largest weekly drop in nearly six months, as strong U.S. jobs data and bargain hunting by investors pitted against seasonally weak consumption of oil.
The oil market initially rose about 1 percent or more after the U.S. economy posted the largest job gains in eight months in June and on worries about fresh militant attacks on Nigerian oil infrastructure.
Oversupply concerns, however, resurfaced with data showing the U.S. oil rig count rose by 10 this week as drillers added rigs for a fifth week in six as analysts to predict the near two-year slump in drilling has bottomed and production will start to edge up early next year. [RIG/U]
""Some of the gloom and doom on demand destruction for oil has gone away with the U.S. jobs numbers,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Chicago-based brokerage Price Futures Group.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) ended the session up 36 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $46.76 per barrel, after trading between $47.23 and $46.15.
U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures (CLc1) settled up 27 cents at $45.41, compared with an earlier drop to $44.77 and a high of $45.97.
Both benchmarks were down nearly 8 percent for the week - the largest weekly slide for Brent since January and the biggest weekly drop for WTI since February.
Crude futures remain some 75 percent above 12-year lows of $27 for Brent and $26 for WTI hit in the first quarter. But the market has gyrated since hitting above $50 as a glut of refined products replaced worries about crude oversupply that caused a near two-year long tumble earlier.
Futures hit two-month lows on Thursday, with WTI breaking below key support of $45.83 after weekly drawdowns in U.S crude looked inadequate to assuage investor concerns. [EIA/S]
""While we are bullish for next year, we continue to be cautious for the rest of this year,""  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) oil analyst Michael Wittner said.

""For the time being, the path of least resistance for oil prices is lower.""

1344,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 08, 2016 02:37PM ET</span>","Crude extends slight gains, as oil rigs rise for fifth time in six weeks","Investing.com -- Crude futures rose moderately on Friday afternoon, extending slight gains from earlier in the session after a closely-watched report showed that U.S. oil rigs crept up last week, providing some signals that dormant shale producers nationwide may be on the verge of ramping up output. 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for August delivery traded between $44.78 and $45.96 a barrel before closing at $45.30, up 0.16 or 0.35% on the session. The front month contract for U.S. crude bounced off near two-month lows, one day after sliding below $45 a barrel for the first time since early-May. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for September delivery wavered between $46.15 and $47.23 a barrel, before settling at $46.67, up 0.27 or 0.58%. 
On Friday afternoon, oil services firm Baker Hughes reported that U.S. oil rigs rose by 10 to 351 last week for the week ending on July 1. It marked the fifth weekly increase in the domestic rig count over the last six weeks. The combined Oil and Gas count, meanwhile, increased by nine to 440 as gas rigs last week inched down by 1 to 89. Over the first week of June, the overall count moved higher for the first time in 2016 ending a 41-week drought. 
While Baker Hughes said the average oil rig count increased by about 2% in June on a monthly basis, it still fell by approximately 50% from its level 12 months earlier. Although U.S. shale producers have been forced to slash drilling due to persistently low oil prices, many have responded by shutting down their least efficient rigs. 
Oil prices recovered somewhat in Friday's session after a government report a day earlier showed a lower than expected crude inventory draw last week. Though the the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a decline of 2.23 million barrels on the week, analysts expected a sharper decease following estimates of a 6.7 million barrel drawdown from the American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday evening. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, stood at 96.37 in U.S. afternoon trading, up 0.04% on the session. Earlier, the index hit an intraday high of 96.71, in response to a robust U.S. jobs report for the month of June. 
Dollar denominated commodities such as crude become more expensive for foreign purchasers when the dollar appreciates.
U.S. crude futures are up more than 60% from their level on February 11 when they slumped to 13-year lows at $26.05 a barrel. Crude futures have still fallen precipitously over the last two years when they peaked at $115 a barrel in June, 2014.

1345,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 08, 2016 01:33PM ET</span>",Gold pares losses amid high volatility following robust U.S. jobs report,"Investing.com -- Gold pared considerable losses amid high volatility in credit and currency markets, as the prospects for a 2016 interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve increased on Friday following reports of robust domestic job gains last month.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded between $1,336.50 and $1,371.35 an ounce, before settling at $1,358.10, down 4.00 or 0.29% on the session. Gold closed lower for the second consecutive session, retreating from 28-month highs of $1,374.90 from earlier this week. Despite the mild losses, the precious metal is still up nearly 7% since voters in the U.K. approved a referendum paving the way for Britain's departure from the European Union late last month. Since opening the year around $1,075 an ounce, Gold has surged more than 28% amid indications of a potential global recession.
Gold likely gained support at $1,323.50, the low from June 8 and was met with resistance at $1,391.40 the high from March 17, 2014.
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics said nonfarm payrolls rose by 287,000 in June, defying expectations for an increase of 180,000 and posting the highest monthly gains in eight months. The struggling labor market demonstrated broad signs of improvement last month following downwardly revised gains of 11,000 in May, providing indications that the weak hiring period in late-Spring could have been an anomaly. Nevertheless, the three-month moving average fell sharply to 147,300, in line with the Fed's expectations, down from 195,700 over the first quarter.
Within the report, the gains were concentrated in leisure and hospitality, health care and social assistance and financial assistance. The leisure and hospitality category added 58,000 positions for the month after remaining relatively flat in May. The telecommunications industry also experienced a snapback, adding 28,000 positions as thousands of Verizon workers returned to work following a labor dispute the previous month. At the same time, the struggling manufacturing sector reported a rare gain, adding 14,000 jobs on the month. Notably, approximately 90% of the job increases in June went to workers aged 55 or above.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate rose moderately by 0.2 to 4.9%, remaining below the Fed's objective of 5%, while the labor force participation rate inched up by 0.1 to 62.7%. The U-6 Unemployment Rate, which measures workers who are marginally attached to the labor force and are no longer looking for full-time work, fell 0.1 on the month to a seasonally-adjusted 9.6%. By comparison, the Fed's preferred gauge for unemployment, stood at 10.5% a year ago and peaked at 18.0% during the height of the Great Recession.
On Wednesday, the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) June meeting depicted a divided Fed on the long-term outlook for future interest rate hikes. At last month's FOMC monetary policy meeting, participants cited a slowing labor market and the threat of a British exit from the EU as main factors for holding interest rates steady. Following the release of Friday's job report, analysts from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) said there is roughly a 66% chance that the FOMC will raise its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at some point this year.
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, stood at 96.37 in U.S. afternoon trading, up 0.04% on the session. Earlier, the index hit an intraday high of 96.71, in response to the employment situation.

YENAGOA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Attackers blew up an oil pipeline in Nigeria's southern Bayelsa state operated by a subsidiary of Italy's Eni on Friday, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSDC) said.
Nobody has claimed responsibility for the blast, the latest in a spate of attacks on oil and gas facilities in the OPEC member's Niger Delta region over the last few months which have pushed oil production to 30-year lows.
The attack took place at Lasukugbene, said spokesman Desmond Agwu. ""There was a blast (on the) pipeline and my men were exchanging fire with some of the hoodlums,"" he said.
Eni, which operates in Nigeria through its subsidiary Nigerian Agip Oil Company, could not be reached for immediate comment.
Petroleum Ministry sources said in late June that a month-long truce had been agreed with militants but a group called the Niger Delta Avengers, which has carried out most of the attacks, said it did not ""remember"" agreeing to a ceasefire.
The Avengers have claimed responsibility for at least five attacks since Sunday, after around two weeks in which none occurred.

Market participants were eyeing the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report due later Friday, for further confirmation of the strength of the job market after upbeat data was released on Thursday, lending support to the U.S. dollar.
The U.S. Department of Labor said on Thursday that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending July 2 decreased by 16,000 to 254,000 from the previous week’s revised total of 270,000. Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 2,000.
In addition, U.S. Payroll processing firm ADP said non-farm private employment rose 172,000 last month, above forecasts for an increase of 159,000.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors poured the most money into U.S.-based funds invested in precious metals since February, adding $2 billion to these funds in the latest week, data from Thomson Reuters' Lipper service showed on Thursday.
Fund investors bid up gold and other precious metals prices during the seven-day period ended July 6 as markets took cover following Britain's June 23 vote to exit the European Union, a process often referred to as Brexit.
SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) was especially popular, taking in $1.4 billion over the week.
""Investors had been down on gold for such a long period of time,"" said Tom Roseen, Lipper's head of research services.
Now the metal is a top performer. Precious metals funds posted strong gains in four of the past five weeks, rising more than 4 percent over the most recent week Lipper measured.
The latest week marks the 10th straight week of inflows for gold funds.
Safe-haven U.S. Treasury funds also reeled in $864 million, their third straight week of inflows, according to Lipper.
Investors pulled $1.3 billion from financial-sector funds during the same week - the largest outflows since the week ended July 15, 2015 - as yields on long-term U.S. Treasury debt sank to record lows.
Bank revenues are curbed by persistently low rates.
Emerging markets, by contrast, have been helped by central bankers' loose monetary policy, their distance from the European drama, healthy yields and a rebound in oil prices this year. Emerging-market debt funds took in $481 million, their largest inflows since early March, Lipper said. Taxable bond funds took in $4.1 billion, following strong weeks for corporate-debt funds.
Stock funds posted $1.4 billion in outflows. The optimism of exchange-traded fund investors that the Brexit vote might not derail stocks was nonetheless overwhelmed by a long-running trend of withdrawals from stock mutual funds.
U.S.-based stock mutual funds posted $6.1 billion in outflows in the latest week, their 17th week of cash withdrawals, according to Lipper data.
Stock ETFs took in $4.6 billion in the latest week ended Wednesday, according to the data.
""The flight to safety was a bit mixed,"" said Roseen. Some people, he said, ""have finally breathed a sigh of relief that Brexit was not as bad as they anticipated.""
Funds focused on domestic shares took in $1.5 billion, breaking a streak of outflows that lasted nine consecutive weeks. Funds focused on international stocks posted $2.9 billion in outflows.
European stock funds posted $1.4 billion in outflows during the week, their largest withdrawals in Lipper's database since May.
Low-risk money market funds posted $34 billion in outflows after $25 billion inflows the week prior, which Roseen said could be attributed to end-of-quarter cash movements by investors.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for August delivery held gains above 1% and the $45.50 level after closing at $45.17, or 4.79% on Thursday. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Brent crude for September delivery gained 1.25% to $46.98
Overnight, crude futures plunged to near two-month lows on Thursday, after a lower than expected U.S. inventory draw last week provided a stark reminder that the conclusion of a prolonged downturn in oil prices is nowhere in sight.
At session-lows, the front month contract for U.S. crude futures dipped below $45 a barrel for the first time since May 11.
On Thursday morning, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report that U.S. commercial crude oil inventories decreased by 2.23 million barrels for the week ending on July 1. While the draw was in line with expectations for a decline of 2.25 million barrels, analysts expected a considerably higher reduction following estimates of a 6.7 million barrel draw-down a day earlier from the American Petroleum Institute. With the sharp declines, API reported its seventh consecutive weekly draw and largest in 13 months.
Both reports were released one day later than usual this week due to the Fourth of July holiday.
At 524.4 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are at historically high levels for this time of year. For the week, total motor gasoline inventories decreased by 0.1 million barrels, while distillate fuel inventories declined by 1.6 million barrels. Meanwhile, production plummeted by 192,000 or 2.25% last week to 9.428 million barrels per day, suffering its largest weekly decline since September, 2013. It came amid a 31.5% drop in weekly production in Alaska, along with a 0.5% decrease in the lower 48 states.
Over the last six months, U.S. crude output has moved lower in 23 of the last 24 weeks to fall to its lowest level since May, 2014. By comparison, weekly output in the U.S. eclipsed 9.4 million bpd 13 months ago, hitting its highest level in 44 years.
While U.S. output continues to fall at a rapid pace, OPEC production remains near all-time highs. Earlier this week, a Bloomberg survey showed that OPEC production increased by 240,000 bpd in June to 32.88 million bpd. For the month, production in Saudi Arabia surged 70,000 bpd to 10.33 million bpd, lingering near its highest level on record.
Crude futures have fallen by more than 50% since hitting a peak at $115 a barrel in June, 2014.

Since polls closed in the historic referendum two weeks ago, the safe-haven asset has surged more than 7%. More broadly, Gold has jumped by nearly 30% year-to-date as investors have engaged in a flight to safety from high-risk equities, due primarily to signs of a global economic slowdown and a delayed interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
On Thursday morning, ADP said in its monthly employment report that nonfarm payrolls rose by 172,000 in June, above May's revised total of 168,000 and considerably higher than consensus estimates of 150,000. Last month's revised total from the payroll services firm contrasts sharply from May's government report, which showed an increase of 38,000, the lowest monthly increase in nearly six years. Analysts expect that the report from the U.S. Department of Labor will show monthly job gains of 180,000, its highest total in three months. Economists expect a rebound following the return of approximately 35,000 Verizon workers, which were on strike in June during a labor dispute.
While Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has emphasized the importance of not placing an undue amount of weight on a single report, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) characterized the slowing labor market as a factor for holding interest rates steady at its monetary policy meeting last month. Prior to the disappointing report, Yellen said at a speech at Harvard University in late-May that it could be appropriate to raise interest rates in the coming months. Since then, the FOMC lowered its long-term rate outlook while markets have taken a 2016 rate hike off the table entirely.
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
Elsewhere, International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde said in an interview with the Financial Times that the U.K. could soften the effects of the Brexit decision by agreeing to a deal that would grant it access to the European Union's single market, while complying with the bloc's laws on freedom of movement. A swift resolution could reduce Britain's GDP growth by only 1.5% through 2019, Lagarde said. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz (DE:DE:ALVG), also cautioned on Thursday that the British Pound could hit parity with the U.S. dollar if leaders in the U.K. fail to develop an alternative plan that provides businesses nationwide with a free trade agreement with members of the bloc.
Since voters in the U.K. resoundingly approved a referendum to leave the EU late last month, investors have piled into safe-haven assets such as gold, government bonds and the Japanese yen while engaging in broad risk-off trade.

On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Brent crude for September delivery wavered between $46.16 and $49.59 a barrel, before settling at $46.45, down 2.35 or 4.82%.
On Thursday morning, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report that U.S. commercial crude oil inventories decreased by 2.23 million barrels for the week ending on July 1. While the draw was in line with expectations for a decline of 2.25 million barrels, analysts expected a considerably higher reduction following estimates of a 6.7 million barrel draw-down a day earlier from the American Petroleum Institute. With the sharp declines, API reported its seventh consecutive weekly draw and largest in 13 months.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - The prolonged slump in oil prices has slammed the office market in the U.S. energy industry hub of Houston, where more than 10 million square feet is available and vacancy rates are at their highest in 20 years, the real estate firm CBRE reported.
Thousands of energy industry employees have lost jobs and companies have slashed their capital budgets during the steep slide in crude prices, which are still down more than 50 percent since 2014.
CBRE found that 10.2 million square feet of commercial real estate was available to sublease at the end of June, as companies sought to shrink their footprint and get others to cover the terms of their leases. 
That was roughly 19.8 percent of total available office space in Houston, CBRE found, a level not touched since low oil prices during the mid-1990s. 
""When a healthy, growing, energy-driven market is hit with a sudden drop in oil prices, demand will slow,"" CBRE said in its quarterly report.
Early this decade, Houston had enjoyed robust economic growth thanks to advances in hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield processes that had helped usher in a massive period of growth for the American energy industry.
During that period of growth, developers built more than 26 million square feet of office space, roughly the equivalent of 10 Empire State Buildings. 
Many U.S. oil companies are headquartered in or near Houston. Downtown Houston has about 10 percent of its office space vacant, while the city's Energy Corridor neighborhood has about 14 percent vacant, according to the CBRE report.
If the trend continues, CBRE said more than 1 million square feet of office space could hit the market by September, and total availability across the city could breach 21 percent by next year.

CBRE found that many companies are using the downturn to push landlords to renovate their existing offices or move them into higher-class offices at similar or reduced rental rates.

1355,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2016 02:50PM ET</span>",'Fallen angel' ETFs bet big on further energy renaissance,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The top-performing high-yield bond exchange-traded fund is betting big that energy companies will not be deadbeats.
The $212 million VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond Exchange Traded Fund is winning its category this year by focusing almost exclusively on particular low-rated bonds: so-called fallen angels, or downgraded bonds that used to be investment grade but have since fallen from grace.
The fund, which is outperforming the largest broad high-yield debt competitor over three years as well, was able to sidestep the rout in oil and gas company debt that accompanied the 74 percent drop in crude prices between June 2014 and Feb. 11, when oil bottomed out at $26.05 a barrel.
During that long oil price slide, ANGL lost 8.2 percent while the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF dropped 13.2 percent.
Now with energy companies dominating the fallen angels list, ANGL is betting more on that sector than HYG or most other broad high-yield (also called junk bond) competitors. ANGL's 25 percent energy exposure is more than double iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF's 12 percent weighting.
""It's a recovery trade,"" said Matthew Tucker, head of iShares Americas fixed-income strategy at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), which launched its own fallen angels ETF last month. The iShares Fallen Angels USD Bond ETF has a 28 percent energy weighting.
Oil's rebound this year - U.S. crude traded above $45 on Thursday [O/R] - has already helped energy debt. ANGL has leapt 21 percent since Feb 11. It is up 16.5 percent so far this year, while its category is up 6.9 percent, Lipper said.
Yet it is not a risk-free trade. The oil-price rebound has not cured the energy sector's problems. Fitch Ratings Inc pegs the 12-month U.S. high-yield energy default rate at 15 percent in June and expects the number to rise to 20 percent this year.
Furthermore, the ANGL fund is more interest rate-sensitive than its competitors. Should rates rise by 1 percent, it could drive a 5 percent decline for ANGL, according to data service FactSet Research Systems Inc.
Likewise, ANGL's bonds - higher-grade than HYG's - are more likely to lose value if spreads between U.S. Treasuries and junk bond yields widen, FactSet statistics showed.
The reverse is true - the bonds could rocket up more in favorable markets. If rising rates signal an improving economy, it will be easier for energy firms to repay debts, VanEck portfolio manager Fran Rodilosso said.

The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits fell by 16,000 to 254,000 last week. Analysts expected jobless claims to remain unchanged at 270,000 last week.
The report came after payroll processing firm ADP said non-farm private employment rose by 172,000 in June, above expectations for an increase of 159,000 and improving from 168,000 in May.
Market players now looked ahead to Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report. The consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 175,000 last month, following an increase of just 38,000 in May, the unemployment rate is forecast to inch up to 4.8% from 4.7%, while average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.2% after gaining 0.2% a month earlier.
An upbeat employment report will point to an improving economy and support the case for higher interest rates in the coming months, while a weak report would add to uncertainty over the economic outlook and push prospects of tighter monetary policy further off the table.
According to the minutes of the Fed's June policy meeting released on Wednesday, policymakers agreed that it was “prudent to wait” for additional data before considering another rate hike.

A day earlier, prices surged to $1,377.50, a level not seen since March 2014, as uncertainty surrounding global growth in wake of Britain’s vote to exit the EU sent investors flooding into safe haven assets.
Gold has been well-supported in recent weeks amid fading expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike in the next couple of months and as expectations mounted that central banks around the world will step up monetary stimulus to counteract the negative economic shock from the Brexit vote.

1364,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2016 04:42AM ET</span>",Cruel summer for U.S. refiners as margins tank,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Summer driving season is in full swing and American motorists are filling their tanks at a healthy clip, but that is not swelling the profit margins as much as usual at U.S. independent oil refiners such as PBF Energy Inc (N:PBF) and  Valero Energy  Corp. (N:VLO)
In April, executives shrugged off the industry’s lousy first quarter as an aberration that would be remedied this summer.
“We still are bullish gasoline and bullish octane,"" PBF CEO Tom Nimbley told investors in an earnings call back then. “The driving season really hasn't hit that hard yet.”
Nimbley was right about the surging summer demand. But refiner margins are still being squeezed as gasoline and diesel inventories stubbornly sit well above five-year averages.
Summer gasoline demand usually fattens margins for refiners with seasonally high levels for the crack spread, the premium of a barrel of gasoline over a barrel of crude oil. 
That will not happen this year, said analysts who expect the situation to remain bleak in the weeks ahead unless there are large drawdowns in inventories.
Late on Wednesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, assuaged some of those concerns, reporting a 3.6-million-barrel drawdown in gasoline stocks. Yet inventories remain much higher than they were last year at this time, and analysts have slashed earnings estimates for big U.S. refiners who report second-quarter results in coming weeks.
The situation is so dire that U.S. East Coast refineries have been cutting production. Refiners on the East Coast, known as ""PADD 1"" by the U.S. Energy Department, are typically the first to feel a profit pinch, because their margins tend to be thinner than those of other regions. 
“PADD 1 is a holy mess,” said Andrew Lebow, senior partner at Commodity Research Group in Darien, Connecticut. “It is very unusual. If a market becomes extremely oversupplied, like PADD 1, they are going to have to cut runs.”
The U.S. gasoline crack spread <1RBc1-CLc1>, a proxy for refiner margins, has dropped 34 percent in two weeks. On Wednesday, it hit a five-year low for this time of year of $13.10 a barrel. That is less than half the crack spread of $28 a barrel at this time last year.
""An RBOB crack trading 13 bucks in the middle of driving season is unheard of,"" said one trader.
East Coast gasoline stocks hit a record 72.4 million barrels, about 17 percent higher than the same time last year, data from the U.S. Energy Department showed last week. Overall, U.S. gasoline stocks were at 239 million barrels in the week to June 24, nearly 10 percent higher than last year and 15 million barrels more than the five-year average.
The glut is so extreme that several tankers full of products were forced to sit idle in New York Harbor recently, waiting to unload.
Inventories have grown despite evidence that U.S. motor travel continues to surge. Analysts noted that U.S. refiners switched to maximum gasoline mode earlier than usual during a fleeting moment of high margins in the early part of 2016. Imports also have been higher than normal in recent weeks, adding to the glut.
John Auers, executive vice president at Turner, Mason & Co, a Dallas-based consultancy, said he remains bullish on gasoline demand and refining margins this summer, noting that gasoline and diesel inventories can draw down just as fast they fill up. 
“I think we will see some significant drawdowns in July and August, and that will help margins,” Auers said. “I think $50 a barrel for crude oil will be the high water mark, so gas prices will remain low and we will have a record driving season this summer.""
He warned that if inventories remain historically high at the end of the summer, refiners could be forced to cut production significantly to account for weaker seasonal demand. 
The 10 largest independent U.S. refiners booked a combined net income of $944 million in the first quarter, down 74 percent from a year earlier, a Reuters analysis showed. That put profits on track to be much less than the annual level of more than $10.6 billion in the past five years. 
Auers estimated that second-quarter margins would come in as the lowest for this normally profitable quarter in at least five years. Over the last 30 days, estimates for second-quarter earnings have fallen 17 to 20 percent for four of the major U.S. refiners, Phillips 66 (N:PSX), Valero Energy (N:VLO), Marathon Petroleum (N:MPC) and  Tesoro  (N:TSO), according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. 

The S&P 500 oil & gas refining & marketing sub-index <.SPLRCENRM>, composed of those four companies, has lost 22 percent this year.

The EU executive said the probe, opened on Thursday, will focus on the period July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016.
In addition to Russian and Brazilian iron and steel exporters, the Commission is also targeting those from Serbia, Ukraine and Iran. The companies have been given 15 days to contact the EC with their details.
The European Steel Association (Eurofer), whose members account for more than a quarter of EU iron and steel products, triggered the case with a May complaint.
""The complainant has provided evidence that imports of the product under investigation from the countries concerned have increased overall in absolute terms and in terms of market share,"" the Commission said in the Official Journal.
The EU, which can impose duties on imports if there is evidence that these are sold at below fair market prices and are damaging the businesses of European competitors, now has 10 anti-dumping investigations underway into steel products.

Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for September delivery tacked on 30 cents, or 0.61%, to $49.10. On Wednesday, London-traded Brent futures rose 84 cents, or 1.75%.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its weekly report on oil supplies at 15:00GMT, or 11:00AM ET, amid expectations for a drop of 2.3 million barrels.
Gasoline stockpiles are expected to decline by 353,000 barrels while stocks of distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, are forecast to increase by 31,000 barrels, according to analysts.
The report comes out one day later than usual due to the Independence Day holiday in the U.S. on Monday.
After markets closed Wednesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said that U.S. oil inventories fell by 6.7 million barrels in the week ended July 1.
Signs of a potential recovery in U.S. drilling activity remained in focus. According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. rose by 11 last week to 341, marking the fourth increase in five weeks.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.

The U.S. was to release the ADP jobs report for June at 12:15GMT, or 8:15AM ET, followed by weekly jobless claims data at 12:30GMT, or 8:30AM ET.
Market players are also focusing on Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report. The consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 175,000 last month, following an increase of just 38,000 in May, the unemployment rate is forecast to inch up to 4.8% from 4.7%, while average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.2% after gaining 0.2% a month earlier.
An upbeat employment report will point to an improving economy and support the case for higher interest rates in the coming months, while a weak report would add to uncertainty over the economic outlook and push prospects of tighter monetary policy further off the table.
Market players all but ruled out further rate hikes by the Fed this year in the aftermath of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. In fact, futures markets are now reflecting a chance that the Fed could actually cut interest rates before the end of the year.
According to the CME Fed Watch tool, there’s currently a 0% probability of a Fed rate hike in July and a 5% probability of a rate cut.
Federal Reserve policymakers decided in June that interest rate hikes should stay on hold until they have a handle on the consequences of Britain's vote on EU membership, according to the minutes of the Fed's June policy meeting released on Wednesday.
The minutes added that Fed officials agreed that it was “prudent to wait” for additional data before considering another rate hike.
Gold for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up 70 cents, or 0.05% to trade at $1,367.80 a troy ounce by 06:50GMT, or 2:50AM ET.
A day earlier, prices surged to $1,377.50, a level not seen since March 2014, as uncertainty surrounding global growth in wake of Britain’s vote to exit the EU sent investors flooding into safe haven assets.
Gold has been well-supported in recent weeks amid fading expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike in the next couple of months and as expectations mounted that central banks around the world will step up monetary stimulus to counteract the negative economic shock from the Brexit vote.
The yellow metal rose almost 9% in June, its biggest monthly increase since February. Prices are up nearly 29% so far this year.

1372,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2016 04:35PM ET</span>",DoubleLine's Gundlach: Gold remains best investment in 'shaky' world,"By Jennifer Ablan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, the chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said on Wednesday that gold remains the best investment amid fears of instability in the European Union and prolonged global stagnation, as well as concerns over the effectiveness of central bank policies.
""Things are shaky and feeling dangerous,” Gundlach said in a telephone interview. “I am not selling gold.”
Gold hit more than two-year highs on Wednesday as some bond yields slid to record lows in the wake of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, prompting investors to buy bullion as a haven from risk. Spot gold , which is up almost 30 percent so far this year, was up 0.56 percent at $1,363 per ounce at 2:34 p.m. EDT (1834 GMT)
Gundlach, who has been a staunch supporter of the precious metal and sees gold rising to $1400 an ounce this year, said gold bullion and gold-related stocks are attractive relative to government bonds, which have been hitting record low yields in recent days. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit a session high on Wednesday of 1.393 percent after its earlier record low of 1.321 percent. 
""You're seeing people who hated the '2 percent' 10-year suddenly loving it at a 1.38-1.39 percent revisit of the all-time low closing yield,"" Gundlach said. 
""If you buy 10-year Treasuries now, I would say, it is a terrible trade location. It is the worst trade location in the history of the 10-year Treasury.""
Gundlach, who oversees $100 billion at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine, said gold is attractive against the backdrop of ""a banking system in Europe, which is in a state of heading toward insolvency.""
He was referring to Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS), Italy's third largest bank, whose pile of bad debts and capital shortfalls are threatening contagion to other European Union nations. Gundlach also cited  Deutsche Bank  AG, whose shares hit a new record low Wednesday and whose value has halved since the beginning of the year. 
""Banks are dying and policymakers don’t know what to do,"" Gundlach said. ""Watch Deutsche Bank shares go to single digits and people will start to panic... you'll see someone say, 'Someone is going to have to do something'.""

Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) shares were down 5.56 percent on Wednesday to $11.54. Gundlach, known on Wall Street as the 'Bond King,' is one of the first heavyweight investors to recommend gold as a hedge against the credibility of major central banks as countries struggle to manage economic growth.

Natural gas for delivery in August on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell to a session low of $2.697 per million British thermal units, its weakest since June 27. It last stood at $2.745 by 14:30GMT, or 10:30AM ET, down 1.9 cents, or 0.69%.
A day earlier, natural gas plunged 22.3 cents, or 7.47%, the steepest one-day loss since late October, after updated weather forecasting models showed that temperatures may be mostly normal in the lower 48 states from July 15 through July 19.
Forecasts originally called for warmer than normal readings across most parts of the U.S. during the period.
Meanwhile, traders looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U.S. gas inventories to gauge the strength of demand for the fuel.

Prices are up nearly 50% since late May as expectations have grown that hot summer weather will lead to heavy demand.
Gas futures jumped to $2.998 last week, the highest since May 2015, as hot summer temperatures across most parts of the U.S. raised expectations for power generation demand to meet air conditioning needs.
A rally for natural gas this time of year isn't unusual. Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil edged lower on Wednesday, extending losses to a third straight session, as investors grew concerned over consumption due to weaker demand from refineries and potentially slower economic growth after Britain's decision to leave the EU.
Despite record demand from drivers across the United States, an excess of gasoline worldwide has weighed on refineries' profitability, leading some to cut runs and throwing the demand for crude oil in doubt.
Investors also awaited data on U.S. crude inventories, delayed due to Monday's Independence Day holiday.
Global benchmark Brent futures were down 75 cents, or 1.6 percent, at $47.21 a barrel at 1136 GMT after a 4.1 percent drop on Tuesday.
U.S. crude traded at $45.96 a barrel, down 64 cents or 1.4 percent. The contract fell 5 percent to end at $46.60 on Tuesday.
""Oil once again is testing key support levels and the inventory report will be the next focus, especially the level of gasoline inventories,"" said Ole Hansen, commodity strategist at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen.
He told the Reuters Global Oil Forum that Brent was edging closer to the technical price graph support level of $47 a barrel and U.S. crude was rapidly approaching its support level of $45.8.
Analysts at Petromatrix said if WTI breaches this level, the next support test will be at $43.
The U.S. crude inventory data could change momentum if it shows another stock draw as an indicator that a supply glut is starting to ease.
A Reuters poll showed analysts expected weekly U.S. commercial oil stocks to have fallen for a seventh consecutive week, along with a probable drop in gasoline stockpiles.
They forecast a 2.5-million-barrel draw in crude stocks and a 1.2-million-barrel fall in gasoline inventories.

""The general bullish sentiment for gold coupled with the post-Brexit uncertainty continues to underpin the metal and the complex as a whole,"" wrote MKS Group trader James Gardiner.
Holdings by SPDR Gold Trust rose to 31.6 million ounces, the biggest in three years.
The flight to gold picked up speed on reports three British commercial property funds worth about 10 billion pounds had suspended trading within 24 hours.

Investors continued to closely monitor banking stocks in Italy one day after reports surfaced that the European Central Bank asked bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena to accelerate its sale of troublesome Non-Performing Loans (NPL).
On Monday, Monte Paschi, the third-largest bank in Italy, said it received a letter from the ECB asking the lender to come up with a three-year business plan to cut the amount of its Non-Performing Loans nearly in half to 14.6 billion euro's by 2018. The letter came on the heels of conflicting reports that Italy prime minister Matteo Renzi could flout EU banking rules by injecting up to €150 billion of liquidity into banks nationwide in order to rescue the troubled financial sector. Banking stocks in Italy have tumbled more than 30% since the Brexit referendum passed, extending sharp losses year to date.
Complicating matters, new EU rules passed in January prevent the use of public funds to support troubled banks until creditors from the private sector have been ""bailed-in,"" or have assumed a burden of the bad debt that is being written off. As a result, a number of investors holding the junior bonds could take a hit if the EU prohibits the Italian government from providing emergency support to the banks.
More broadly, the reports exacerbate concerns that Italy may consider a referendum to leave the EU, helping contagion fears of the potential collapse of the European bloc.
Gold is a safe-haven for investors in periods of significant economic uncertainty.

However, the correction could also lead to growing concerns among economists related to further slowdowns in the Chinese economy after GDP growth last year slumped below 7.0% for the first time in more than two decades.

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2016 06:30PM ET</span>","Kazakhs, Chevron-led group approve $37 billion Tengiz field expansion","By Raushan Nurshayeva
ASTANA (Reuters) - Kazakhstan and a group of oil companies led by  Chevron  (N:CVX) have approved a $36.8 billion plan to boost production at the Central Asian country's Tengiz field, a rare major investment in an industry hit by low prices and a boost to the local economy. 
The field, one of the world's biggest, already accounts for more than a third of total crude output in Kazakhstan, which is the biggest former Soviet oil producer after Russia.
Under the plan, Tengiz, in which  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) and Lukoil (MM:LKOH) also have stakes, will increase output to 39 million tonnes a year (850,000 barrels per day) by 2022 from 27 million tonnes currently, Kazakhstan's Energy Ministry and its foreign partners said in a joint statement on Tuesday.
The Tengiz expansion is the biggest final investment decision in the oil industry this year and one of just three major projects in recent years, two others being Statoil’s Johan Sverdrup and Shell’s Appomatox.
The move comes at a time when energy companies are tightening their belts due to low oil prices. At its peak, Tengiz output will be roughly the same as the current oil production of Britain.
""Today we are witnessing a historic event not just for the oil and gas sector but for the whole country,"" Kazakh Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev told reporters in Astana, sitting next to executives of Tengizchevroil, the joint venture operating Tengiz, and partner companies.
Bozumbayev said the expansion would generate about $120 billion in extra tax payments by 2033 when the Tengiz contract expires.
In a separate statement, Chevron said the total project budget included $27.1 billion for facilities, $3.5 billion for wells and $6.2 billion for contingency and escalation.
Tengizchevroil General Director Ted Etchison said the project would be financed by a combination of own funds, contributions from partners and borrowings. He did not provide any details.
Tengizchevroil sent final documents to banks for a $3 billion five- to seven-year loan agreement last week.
Kazakhstan holds a 20 percent stake in the venture via state oil and gas firm KazMunayGaz . Chevron owns 50 percent, Exxon Mobil has 25 percent and Lukarco, controlled by Russia's LUKOIL, the remaining 5 percent.
Oil is Kazakhstan's main export and the nation of 18 million has tripled output since gaining independence in 1991, although production has edged down in the last few years due to a natural decline at some mature fields.
Tengiz's development contrasts with another giant Kazakh project, Kashagan, whose launch has been postponed by many years and which is due to start pumping in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Kashagan's multiple technical problems - such as pipelines that leaked toxic gas - have slowed Kazakhstan's ambitious strategy to boost output to 130 million tonnes a year (3 million barrels per day) and become one of the world's top 10 producers.

The Astana government had initially planned to achieve that target by last year but has now pushed it back to 2020.

Since opening the year around $1,075, Gold has soared nearly 25% over the last six months, amid mounting concerns of a worldwide recession and a delayed interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.

Investors continued to closely monitor banking stocks in Italy one day after reports surfaced that the European Central Bank asked bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena to accelerate its sale of troublesome Non-Performing Loans (NPL). On Monday, Monte Paschi, the third-largest bank in Italy, said it received a letter from the ECB asking the lender to come up with a three-year business plan to cut the amount of its Non-Performing Loans nearly in half to 14.6 billion euro's by 2018. The letter came on the heels of conflicting reports that Italy prime minister Matteo Renzi could flout EU banking rules by injecting up to €150 billion of liquidity into banks nationwide in order to rescue the troubled financial sector. Banking stocks in Italy have tumbled more than 30% since the Brexit referendum passed, extending sharp losses year to date.
Complicating matters, new EU rules passed in January prevent the use of public funds to support troubled banks until creditors from the private sector have been ""bailed-in,"" or have assumed a burden of the bad debt that is being written off. As a result, a number of investors holding the junior bonds could take a hit if the EU prohibits the Italian government from providing emergency support to the banks. More broadly, the reports exacerbate concerns that Italy may consider a referendum to leave the EU, helping contagion fears of the potential collapse of the European bloc.
Gold is a safe-haven for investors in periods of significant economic uncertainty.
Elsewhere, officials from China's National Statistics Bureau (NSB) announced on Tuesday that it is changing its method for calculating the nation's GDP, marking the second time the bureau has made an adjustment to the calculation in less than a year. The adjustment will reportedly add $131 billion to the world's second-largest economy for fiscal year 2015. However, the correction could also lead to growing concerns among economists related to further slowdowns in the Chinese economy after GDP growth last year slumped below 7.0% for the first time in more than two decades.
China is the world's largest producer of Gold and the second-largest consumer of the precious metal behind India.

Natural gas for delivery in August on the New York Mercantile Exchange tumbled by as much as 6.5% to an intraday low of $2.801 per million British thermal units, its weakest since June 28. It last stood at $2.806 by 14:39GMT, or 10:39AM ET, down 18.1 cents, or 6.06%.
Gas futures jumped to $2.998 on Friday, the highest in more than a year, as hot summer temperatures across most parts of the U.S. raised expectations for power generation demand to meet air conditioning needs.
Last week, natural gas futures soared 35.1 cents, or 12.21%, the sixth straight weekly gain. Prices are up nearly 50% since late May as expectations have grown that hot summer weather will lead to heavy demand.
A rally for natural gas this time of year isn't unusual. Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 37 billion cubic feet last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, below forecasts for an increase of 45 billion. That compared with builds of 62 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 73 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 78 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.140 trillion cubic feet, 18.5% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 20.3% above the five-year average for this time of year.
In the week ahead, market players will be focusing on weekly U.S. storage data on Thursday for fresh supply-and-demand signals. Some analysts believe this week’s storage addition will be less than usual for this time of year due to a recent burst of warmer-than-normal summer weather across most parts of the U.S.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2016 05:06AM ET</span>",Oil falls below $50 on economic concerns,"By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell below $50 a barrel on Tuesday as concern about a potential slowdown in economic growth that would weigh on demand trumped supply outages in Nigeria and other exporting nations.
Trade in one of Britain's largest property funds was suspended in one of the first signs of major financial stress following the country's vote to leave the EU. A flurry of data from China in coming weeks is expected to show weakness in trade and investment.
Brent crude was down $1.04 at $49.06 a barrel at 0847 GMT. The global benchmark is still up more than 80 percent from a 12-year low close to $27 reached in January. U.S. crude was down $1.28 at $47.71 a barrel.
""Asia has been relatively weak and China is not providing much support,"" said Olivier Jakob, oil analyst at Petromatrix, who also said weak refined products were pressuring crude.
""Without the support of the products and with a structure in crude oil that is weakening, it is difficult to think that crude can break away to the upside.""
British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said concern over the global economy was weighing.
""The deterioration in the global economic outlook, financial market uncertainty and ripple effects on key areas of oil demand growth are likely to exacerbate already-lackluster industrial demand growth trends,"" the bank said in a report.
The forthcoming Chinese data is also expected to show sluggish industrial output and another drop in foreign reserves, reinforcing views that Beijing will roll out more economic support measures.
Oil has gained support this year from signs that a supply glut that has halved oil prices in the last two years is easing and from unplanned outages from Canada to Nigeria.
The energy minister of Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, and the incoming secretary-general of OPEC agree that the market is heading towards balance, the Saudi state news agency reported on Monday.
A partial recovery in Nigeria contributed to a rise in OPEC output last month, a Reuters survey found last week, but the rebound may be short-lived. [OPEC/O]

1394,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2016 05:00AM ET</span>","U.S. shale firms' first-quarter hedging rush may squeeze margins, spur output","By Catherine Ngai
(Reuters) - As oil prices began recovering from 13-year lows early this year, U.S. shale producers ramped up their hedges against another slump on a scale unseen for at least a year, a Reuters analysis of company disclosures shows.
A review of disclosures by the largest 30 U.S. shale firms showed 17 of them increased their hedge books in the first quarter, the most at least since early 2015. 
Several, including EOG Resources Inc (N:EOG) and  Devon Energy  Corp (N:DVN), two of the biggest shale companies, secured significant protection of future earnings for the first time in at least six months.
A greater volume of hedged production typically indicates more drilling activity ahead as producers that locked in prices for a sizeable part of their output ensure enough cash flow to sustain or increase production.
What makes the outlook more complicated this time is the fact that oil companies, fearing the rally could fizzle, locked in sales at levels around $10 a barrel below both current prices and break even levels for some producers.
For those producers the concern is that their margins will suffer if service costs rise as activity picks up.
It is less clear how it will affect production, though most analysts expect more supply.
Michael Cohen, head of energy commodities research at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York, believes hedges allow producers to plan better even if they secured prices below present levels just below $50 a barrel.
""I think (the hedging) gives producers more security to lock in a capex plan,"" Cohen said, predicting shale production will edge up in the second half of the year.
The 17 companies locked in prices for nearly 55 million barrels of future production, the highest volume in at least a year and some 45 percent more than hedges added by eight companies in the fourth quarter.
The spike in hedging came as crude recovered from February's 13-year lows around $26 a barrel (CLc1) later in the first quarter, a rally that continued into the second quarter.
That recovery stalled, however, in the final weeks of last month amid heightened uncertainty about the impact of Britain's vote to leave the European Union and crude prices slipped back below $50 a barrel. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/1MiNzFx) 
FIRST QUARTER BORROWING
Sometime in the first quarter,  Marathon Oil  Corp (N:MRO), for example, hedged at an average price of $39.25 for the second quarter, when prices averaged just below $46 a barrel.  Denbury Resources Inc  (N:DNR) locked in first-quarter 2017 U.S. crude production at just over $42 a barrel; those futures  this week were trading at about $52 a barrel.
While those deals may look problematic now, analysts point out that they did make more sense three or four months ago.
Michael Tran, director of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York, said that at the time market players had expected oil prices to average at or below $40 this year. 
""You have to remember that sentiment in this market is still so fragile,"" he said. ""Producers ended up locking in something in case we did a double dip."" 
For those that have enough money, the hedges may now act as an incentive to crank up production for the spot market to average up how much they fetch per barrel, said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group in Houston.
For a number of oil producers hedges were more of a necessity than a strategic choice as they needed them to get bank loans, said Thomas McNulty, a director at consultancy Navigant, who advises producers on valuation, transactions and risk management such a hedging. 

""Banks have been working very hard with their clients to continue or extend financing, and that requires producers to hedge more,"" McNulty said, adding that he saw limited appetite for hedging that went beyond what banks required.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2016 02:34AM ET</span>",Twin crises expose Angola's failure to kick its oil habit,"By Ed Cropley
LUANDA (Reuters) - A month ago, a 17 ton shipment of bananas left Angola for Portugal in what state media heralded as a ""first symbolic batch"" in the resurgence of a farming sector wiped out by civil war.
But that war ended 14 years ago and since then Angola has overlooked agriculture, developing instead an addiction to oil income and the imports it buys. Now, with crude less than half its price of two years ago, the country appears to be grinding to a halt.
Africa's top oil producer needs more than a container load of fruit to solve a financial and economic crisis - compounded by a public health crisis - that has laid bare the failings of the ""diversification"" mantra of Jose Eduardo dos Santos, its president for the last 37 years.
Oil wealth turned Angola into sub-Saharan Africa's third-biggest economy and one of the continent's few ""upper-middle income"" states. But beyond the high-rises on the capital's Dubai-style coastal promenade, the problems are plain to see.
Cranes stand idle atop half-finished concrete office blocks in Luanda while piles of rubbish lie uncollected in the streets, a result of municipal budget cuts imposed this year to try to balance the books.
The squalor is a breeding ground for vermin, flies and disease, and health experts say it is no coincidence that a yellow fever epidemic that started in December in one of Luanda's vast slums has spread across the country and beyond, reaching even China.
""Luanda is dirty, disgusting,"" said 58-year-old businessman Antonio Bobbe, edging past a vagrant rummaging through a mound of trash. ""The government doesn't do anything. There's no responsibility. You should see the rats. They're huge.""
On top of the filth, a shortage of hard currency makes doing business tough for anyone but the well-connected. ""If you have friends, government friends, you can get dollars. If not, nothing,"" said Bobbe. ""We hope that the situation changes, but at the moment there's no light at the end of the tunnel.""
""ANGOLA RISING"" NO MORE
Before independence from Portugal in 1974, Angola was a major exporter of fruit, coffee and sisal. Then two decades of conflict destroyed commercial agriculture and since peace returned in 2002 problems ranging from uncleared mines in sugar plantations to uprooted rural workers have frustrated efforts to revive it.
While Angola has rebuilt an impressive infrastructure, getting any sort of productive industry off the ground has gone nowhere apart from the oil on which it relied to achieve breakneck economic growth.
It now churns out 1.8 million barrels a day from its offshore fields and is China's leading crude supplier. But those petro-dollars come at a price.
Oil accounts for 40 percent of GDP, 70 percent of government revenues and 95 percent of foreign exchange income, leaving the nation of 25 million people dangerously exposed to fluctuations in world oil markets.
With crude languishing at $50 a barrel, down from over $100 in mid-2014, Angola is starved of dollars. Growth has slowed to 3 percent - almost a recession in local terms - while the national currency has collapsed and inflation in a country that imports almost everything hit an annual 29 percent in May.
For dos Santos, a Soviet-trained oil engineer regarded as the pillar of post-war stability, the timing of the twin crises could not be worse. They have struck a year before an election and two years before what the 73-year-old president has said will be his retirement.
""The fragilities of the post-conflict state that dos Santos has built are being exposed,"" said Paula Roque, an Angola expert at Britain's Oxford University. ""That whole rhetoric of 'Angola Rising' no longer holds."" 
Desperate, the government swallowed its pride and sought help from the World Health Organization against yellow fever but last week the International Monetary Fund said Luanda had ended talks about a broad financial rescue package.
The government has not commented and finance minister Armando Manuel did not respond to requests for an interview.
GOLDEN GOOSE
Besides yellow fever, few indicators are as telling as the kwanza currency, down more than 40 percent in the last year against the dollar at the official central bank rate.
Available only to a lucky few individuals and firms, the rate is of little consequence to ordinary Angolans, who have to rely on a black market where the kwanza is worth as little as 570 to the dollar, less than a third its official value of 165.
""For people bringing in anything from the United States or South Africa it's very difficult,"" said 26-year-old Nadio Medina, who used to import used cars from South Africa. Now he sells eggs wholesale to pavement burger stalls.
In an unusually frank admission last month, dos Santos admitted that bloated state oil company Sonangol, the central pillar of the economy and the source of nearly all its dollars, had not paid a cent into state coffers since January.
""Our country lives upon imports - imports for food, for raw materials to national manufacturers, for industry, agriculture, construction,"" he said. ""We need to make other goods to export besides the oil. That is a strategic task.""
Yet looking past the rhetoric, the only thing likely to change is Sonangol.
Last month, dos Santos made his 43-year-old daughter Isabel chief executive, inviting cries of ""supersonic nepotism"" from anti-graft website Maka Angola, a rare dissenting voice in one of Africa's most politically-closed states.
Last year, for instance, 17 members of a Luanda book club were jailed for reading a volume described as a ""blue-print for non-violent resistance to repressive regimes"".
Isabel dos Santos - said by Forbes magazine to be Africa's richest woman - insisted her appointment was everything to do with shaking up Sonangol and nothing to do with a dynastic dos Santos succession plan, as her father's opponents allege.
""It's not because of politics. I was brought into this project because of my experience from the private business sector,"" she told Reuters in an interview that laid out her central aim: to produce more oil for less money.
Foreign oil firms  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  BP  (LON:BP) applauded her plans that include having Boston Consulting Group and PriceWaterhouseCoopers as advisers and stripping out Sonangol's real estate, banking and aviation units to focus on oil.
To many, the overhaul is the clearest sign yet that President dos Santos really is preparing for retirement but not necessarily to make way for his daughter. 

""It's not about Isabel becoming president,"" said Alex Vines, head of the Africa program at London's Chatham House think-tank. ""The regime relies on Sonangol. It's the goose that lays the golden egg and the reason she was put in charge is because it needs serious reform.""

LONDON/CALGARY (Reuters) - Global oil prices eased on Monday after comments by Saudi Energy Minister Khaled Al-Faleh that the market was heading toward balance were tempered by slowing demand in Asia, pockets of gasoline oversupply and signs crude output could rise. 
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) settled down 25 cents to $50.10 per barrel. U.S. crude futures (CLc1) were trading down 23 cents at $48.76 per barrel.
U.S. markets are closed on Monday for the U.S. Independence Day holiday, so trading remained thin on the day. 
The energy minister of Saudi Arabia, the world's top crude exporter, and the secretary general of producer club OPEC agreed that global oil markets were heading toward balance, and that prices reflected this.
However, analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said there were also signs prices could fall again soon, pointing at stalling gasoline demand and more oil from Canada and Nigeria after production problems.
In the New York Harbor, at least two tankers carrying gasoline-making components have dropped anchor, unable to discharge their cargo. Several tanks with gasoline also have been diverted, underscoring the latest oversupply issue
Meanwhile, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation said last week that output was rising following repairs after attacks in the Niger Delta that had pushed crude output to 30-year lows.
A deal to unify Libya's rival national oil corporations could pave the way for the OPEC member to boost output which currently stands at less than a quarter of pre-2011 levels of 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd). 
""If the deal materializes it will have a real and considerable impact on the oil market balance for 2017, potentially cancelling out any projected deficit,"" SEB Markets chief analyst for commodities Bjarne Schieldrop said. 
Oil demand and, as a result, prices, could come under pressure as weak refining margins prompt run cuts at a time when plants in Asia are already gearing up for seasonal maintenance work.
""Asia refiners have already started to pull back ... and there are reports of cargoes struggling to sell,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said on Monday.
Russian oil output in June rose slightly from the previous month to 10.84 million bpd.

In Norway, oil workers signed a deal on Saturday, avoiding a strike in western Europe's top producer.

Natural gas for delivery in August on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 1.6 cents, or 0.55%, to trade at $2.899 per million British thermal units by 14:39GMT, or 10:39AM ET.
Volumes were expected to be thin, as U.S. financial markets are closed for the Independence Day holiday. Trading in natural gas futures will close at 1:00PM ET.
Gas futures jumped to $2.998 on Friday, the most since May 2015, as hot summer temperatures across most parts of the U.S. raised expectations for power generation demand to meet air conditioning needs.
Last week, natural gas futures soared 35.1 cents, or 12.21%, the sixth straight weekly gain. A rally for natural gas this time of year isn't unusual. Prices are up nearly 50% since late May as expectations have grown that hot summer weather will lead to heavy demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 37 billion cubic feet last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, below forecasts for an increase of 45 billion. That compared with builds of 62 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 73 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 78 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.140 trillion cubic feet, 18.5% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 20.3% above the five-year average for this time of year.
In the week ahead, market players will be focusing on weekly U.S. storage data on Thursday for fresh supply-and-demand signals. Some analysts believe this week’s storage addition will be less than usual for this time of year due to a recent burst of warmer-than-normal summer weather across most parts of the U.S.

The Avengers have used a Twitter account as its main form of communication, using it to publicize claims of attacks and as a platform to criticize Nigeria's government. 
The group - which says it wants a greater share of Nigeria's oil wealth to be passed on to communities in the impoverished Niger Delta region - posted messages on Sunday saying it had carried out five attacks in the last few days.
""This account has been suspended,"" said a statement on the account. ""We do not comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons,"" said a spokesman for the social media site when asked about the reasons for the suspension. 
However, the spokesman said the company's policies included a ""specific rule pertaining to violent threats"" which states that ""you may not make threats of violence or promote violence, including threatening or promoting terrorism"". 
In February, Twitter said it had shut down more than 125,000 terrorism-related accounts since the middle of 2015, most of which were linked to the Islamic State group.

Many tech companies are increasingly taking stronger steps to police controversial content online in the face of threats from legislators to force the companies to report ""terrorist activity"" on their sites to law enforcement agencies.

Meanwhile, concerns over the U.K.’s decision to leave the European Union faded over the course of the week, with many analysts saying that Britain’s economy is too small for an economic slowdown that could cut oil demand growth substantially.

The merging of the two NOCs is a positive step to recovering the OPEC member's oil sector which has been battered by militant attacks, rival export attempts and closures of pipelines and oil ports by armed factions.
It is also a boost for the U.N.-backed unity government and its presidential council in Tripoli that has struggled to extend its influence over hardline factions and their armed supporters who set up rival administrations in the capital and in the east.
The NOC said current chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, who was named executive before any rival administrations were in place, will remain in the top post while former eastern NOC head Nagi el-Maghrabi will join the unified NOC board.
""There is only one NOC, and it serves all Libyans,"" Sanalla said in the statement. ""This agreement will send a very strong signal to the Libyan people and to the international community that the Presidency Council is able to deliver consensus and reconciliation.""
Prime Minister Fayaz Seraj's presidential council has been in Tripoli for three months since a U.N.-brokered agreement, but it has struggled to make progress and still faces resistance from hardliners who reject its authority.
With no national army, Libya's brigades of former rebels who once battled to oust Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 have turned against each other backing rival political leaders in a scramble for control of Libya and its oil resources.
Libya's oil exports are less than half of the 1.6 million barrels per day it produced before the 2011 uprising. Its two main oil ports are closed and under control of one armed faction that expressed support for the presidential council.
Other fields have been closed by attacks by Islamic State, which took advantage of the chaos to expand its territory. Forces allied to the government are currently fighting to take back the city of Sirte from the group.
The NOC said it recognized the presidential council as the executive and also the parliament in the east, the House of Representatives. It would report to both bodies.

The NOC will unify its budget for the remainder of the financial year, it said, and will make infrastructure rehabilitation a priority. It plans to make its new headquarters in the eastern city of Benghazi.

The Iran Petroleum Contract (IPC) is a cornerstone of the country's plan to raise crude production to the pre-sanctions level of four million barrels per day (bpd), and the OPEC member desperately needs $200 billion in foreign money to reach its goal.
Oil majors have said they would only go back to Iran if it made major changes to the buy-back contracts of the 1990s, which companies such as France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) or Italy's Eni (MI:ENI) said made them no money or even incurred losses.
The launch of contracts has been postponed several times as hardline rivals of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani resisted any deal that could end the buy-back system, dating back more than 20 years, under which foreign firms are banned from booking reserves or taking equity stakes in local companies.
""These contracts will not be signed unless the necessary reforms are implemented in the framework of national interests,"" Khamenei was quoted as saying by the Tasnim news agency on Sunday.

Iran's oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said last week that a final draft for the contracts will be approved by the government after some amendments to appease both critics and foreign companies.

With the sharp gains, domestic oil rigs in the U.S. moved higher for the fourth time in five weeks. At the same time, natural gas rigs inched up by one to 90, helping push the overall count up to 431.
The continued gains in the nationwide rig count provide leading indications that U.S. producers are ready to return online as prices stabilize near $50 a barrel. Despite the recent upswing in prices, crude futures are still down sharply from their level in November, 2014, when OPEC rattled global markets with a strategic decision to maintain its production ceiling above 30 million barrels per day. The tactic triggered a prolonged battle between the U.S. and OPEC for market share, depressing prices amid a glut of oversupply.
Elsewhere, investors continued to closely monitor labor negotiations in Norway where top oil companies and labor unions engaged in heated talks to avoid a work stoppage. If the sides are unable to reach a deal by Saturday's deadline workers at five Norwegian oil fields could strike immediately, resulting in an estimated 6% decline in production, according to the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded between $1,323.00 and $1,344.25 an ounce, up $18.40 or 1.39% on the session. Over the last week, Gold has surged more than 5% as investors have piled into the safe-haven asset in the wake of a surprising decision by U.K. voters to support a measure paving the way for Britain's departure from the European Union. On Thursday, Gold ended the first six months of 2016 up nearly 25%, completing one of its strongest first halves on record.
Gold likely gained support at $1,247.30, the low from June 8 and was met with resistance at $1,355.60, the high from June 24.
In China, the Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index dropped by 0.6 to 48.6 in June, falling at its swiftest pace in four months. It came as new orders moved lower for the month and companies in the sector cut staffing levels at a solid pace. Analysts expected to see a reading of 49.1 At the same time, the government's official Manufacturing PMI ticked down by 0.1 to 50.0, falling to its lowest level since February's reading of 49.0. Any reading under 50.0 provides signals of contraction in the industry. The Chinese government's official reading serves as a gauge for activity among large and state-owned companies in the sector. China is the world's largest producer of gold and the second-largest consumer of the precious metal behind India.
Elsewhere, Fed governor Stanley Fischer cautioned that it could be some time before the U.S. central bank will be able to determine the long-term effects of the Brexit referendum on monetary policy. In the meantime, Fischer said he is hopeful the Fed can continue tightening at a ""slow, very gradual"" pace amid signals of an improved economy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will re-assess the implications of the Brexit vote on the timing of its next rate hike when it meets again on July 26-27, he added.
""We are going to have to wait and see,” Fischer said in an interview with CNBC. “It clearly is a huge event for the U.K. and it’s an important event for Europe. Our direct trade with Britain is not going to make a huge difference to us, but it could set off -- there are a lot of things that will follow from Brexit for Europe, for the United Kingdom, and those are the things we will have to be thinking about.""
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2016 06:00AM ET</span>",Global oil overhang to choke price recovery well into 2018,"By Ahmad Ghaddar
LONDON (Reuters) - For the Saudi energy minister wondering how long it will take the world to use up excess oil stocks and rebalance the market, one picture could help find an answer.
    If all the spare crude was put in tankers today, they could create a queue more than a hundred kilometers long - or about two thirds of the length of the entire Suez Canal. 
It will most likely take until 2018 to clear that glut, say analysts, traders and oil companies - unless an oil producer the size of Nigeria loses half its production for an entire year.
    ""It's very difficult to predict explosions in Nigeria or wild fires in Canada,"" said Hamza Khan, senior commodity strategist at ING. 
    ""If anything, the supply side has a potential to ramp up rather than put further pressure on inventories"". 
    Oil prices have almost doubled after hitting multi-year lows in January, supported by outages from Canada to Nigeria, a steady decline in U.S. production and stronger global demand. 
    But analysts say a sustained price recovery is unlikely until the market clears at least 350 million barrels of excess oil in inventories, enough to fill 350 large crude tankers.
    ""The question now is how fast you will work off the global inventory overhang,"" Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih told a U.S. newspaper last week after saying supply had finally stopped exceeding demand in the past months.
    Global oil stocks hit a record high of 3 billion barrels earlier this year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
    Since mid-2014, global inventories have risen by around 800 million barrels, according to Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy.
    But JBC says half of that amount is ""structural"", encompassing crude that has gone into Chinese and Indian strategic petroleum reserves, and stocks that need to be held to ensure coverage of future demand.
    This leaves the market with around 400 million barrels in inventories to contend with - enough to cover crude consumption of a country like Spain for almost a year.
    
    SHRINKING SLOWLY
    The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has repeatedly said the inventory overhang was a threat to the oil price recovery. It puts OECD commercial stocks at 338 million barrels above the five-year average in its most recent monthly report. [OPEC/O]
    The IEA says that OECD stocks at end-April stood at around 357 million barrels above the five-year average. [IEA/M]
    BP's chief economist Spencer Dale said last month a stock-build of around 350 million barrels in developed economies and a similar number in emerging economies was weighing on oil prices.
    ""The size of the overhang has started to come off,"" Energy Aspects analyst Richard Mallinson said, estimating May OECD stocks dropped by 22 million barrels to just over 330 million barrels above the five year average. 
    The consultancy forecasts small stock-draws of 400,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) for the second half of the year, or around 73 million barrels, as supply cuts globally from China to Kazakhstan and Colombia outstrip an expected drop in oil demand.
    The IEA says that on the assumption OPEC oil production grows modestly in 2017, global oil stocks are expected to build slightly in the first half of 2017 before falling slightly more in the second half of 2017.
    The agency forecasts a 100,000 bpd draw in inventories for 2017, or around 36.5 million barrels, just over a tenth of the overhang.
    JBC says the market could take until early 2018 to return to ""normality"", assuming supply lags demand by around 500,000 bpd.

According to BP's Dale, the oversupply could take up to 18 months to clear even if supply lags demand by 1 million bpd.

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2016 05:48AM ET</span>","Oil supply, demand should be in balance by 2017: U.S. Energy Sec","By Chen Aizhu
BEIJING (Reuters) - The global oil market should see supply and demand in balance by 2017 though it will remain structurally well-supplied for the next couple of years, U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said on Friday. 
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih at the G20 energy meeting in Beijing, Moniz said the two men agreed that despite short-term production impacts, oil supply still exceeds demand. 
""Unless there are big surprises we are still in a situation of more production than demand. The gap is narrowing as global demand grows slowly,"" Moniz said.
""His (Falih's) statement is that balance in supply and demand will probably be reached in the end of this year. That's reasonable, but it could also go into next year.""
However, when that balance comes, there will still be large supplies due to historically high reserves, he added.
As prices recover to the $50 to $60 a barrel level, more drilling rigs will be deployed and more wells will be completed in the U.S., he said, after companies scaled back production as oil prices dived under $40. 
""So structurally the market looks pretty well supplied, there is no reason to think there will be big changes over the next couple of years,"" he said.
On oil policy, Moniz said al-Falih made clear that Saudi Arabia is looking to long-term price setting in the oil markets to follow markets and not quotas.
Moniz also said during the G20 meeting this week the U.S. advocated a timeline for ending subsidies for fossil fuels by the middle of the next decade or 2030, but the countries failed to reach a timeline for the subsidy phase-out. 
Officials from the United Nations and European Union, plus 200 non-governmental organizations, urged the G20 this week to end years of talks and follow the Group of Seven industrialized nations by setting a date to end subsidies on coal, gas and oil.
With growing supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Australia and with the U.S. starting to export LNG, the indexing of LNG to oil prices is weakening which means there will be a more competitively priced spot market, he said.
That would benefit China which is looking to natural gas as an effective approach to cut emissions, Moniz said.

1423,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2016 05:19AM ET</span>",U.S. shale oil's Achilles heel shows signs of mending,"By Ernest Scheyder and Terry Wade
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Since the beginning of the U.S. fracking revolution, oil producers have struggled with a vexing problem: after an initial burst, crude output from new shale wells falls much faster than from conventional wells. 
However, those well decline rates have been slowing across the United States over the past few years, according to data analysis provided exclusively to Reuters. 
The trend, if sustained, would help ameliorate the industry’s most glaring weakness and cement its importance for worldwide production in years to come. It also helps explain shale drillers' resilience throughout the oil market's two-year slump. 
While shale oil production revolutionized the oil industry over the past decade, bringing abundance of global oil supplies, high costs and rapid production declines have been its Achilles heel. That is beginning to change thanks to technological innovation and producers' focusing less on maximizing output and more on improving efficiency and productivity.
According to data compiled and analyzed by oilfield analytics firm NavPort for Reuters, output from the average new well in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the top U.S. oilfield, declined 18 percent from peak production through the fourth month of its life in 2015. That is much slower than the 31 percent drop seen for the same time frame in 2012 and the 28 percent decline in 2013, when the oil price crash started.
The change was even more dramatic in North Dakota's Bakken shale, where four-month decline rates for new wells fell to 16 percent in 2015 from almost 31 percent in 2012. (Graphic:http://tmsnrt.rs/292ScGY)
A slower decline means producers need to drill fewer new wells to sustain output, said Mukul Sharma, professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.
""You can have cash flow without having to expend a lot of capital.""
The recent decline rates mark a dramatic improvement from first-year 90 percent declines in the early years of the shale boom that made some investors question the sector's long-run viability.
NEW PHILOSOPHY
There are no 2016 figures yet, but oil executives expect the trend to continue this year and beyond.
Scott Sheffield, chief executive of  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co (N:PXD), a top Permian producer, credited improved fracking techniques for helping stabilize production, which shareholders rewarded by lifting Pioneer's shares up about 9 percent over the past year.
""We're exposing more of the reservoir and breaking it up so we don't get as sharp a decline,"" Sheffield told a recent energy conference.
Slower declines also reflect producers' more conservative approach to operating wells. In the early years of the hydraulic fracturing boom, high crude prices encouraged operators to boost initial production as much as possible.
To do this, they would let wells flow fast by keeping pressure low on the ground's surface. About seven years ago, however, some shale operators in Louisiana found this ultimately hurt production later on by causing rock fractures to shut. 
Now, many operators maintain surface pressures higher, which limits initial flow rates and slows a well's decline rate.
""Conventional wisdom has shifted,"" said John Lee, a professor of petroleum engineering at Texas A&M University.
Sharma of the University of Texas said that while shale well decline rates remained far above a 10 percent first-year decline a conventional well might experience, they marked a radical improvement compared with early years of hydraulic fracturing.
Harold Hamm's  Continental Resources Inc  (N:CLR), for example, has told investors its new wells in Oklahoma's SCOOP region are now producing 40 percent more oil six months into their lives than as recently as last year. 
Today's production techniques use larger volumes of sand and pressurized fluids to frack more spots along longer well bores, to extract more oil from the wells. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/296vBtQ)
Pioneer fracks its wells every 15 feet today compared to every 60 feet in 2013. It costs extra $500,000 per well to do so, but its wells produce two-thirds more oil than just three years ago, boosting profitability, Pioneer said.
To be sure, not all producers are seeing slower decline rates and the newer, more stable shale wells make up only a fraction of all producing U.S. oil wells, so their impact on overall domestic output is for now limited.

The Eagle Ford shale in southern Texas has seen decline rates slightly increase, for example, according to NavPort data.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2016 04:00AM ET</span>","Oil rises on tighter market outlook, but weak Asian economies weigh","By Henning Gloystein
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday as investors positioned themselves for more price increases this year in expectation of a tighter physical market although renewed signs of an Asian economic slowdown weighed on the gains.
After rising back above $50 per barrel during Asian trading hours, Brent crude oil futures were at $49.96 at 0649 GMT, up 25 cents from their last settlement. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 17 cents at $48.51 a barrel.
Traders said the higher prices were a result of a tightening physical market, in which the large oversupply that led to the 2014-2016 price slump was now being brought back into balance.
""We believe that the fundamentals of the oil market remain favorable for continued price recovery, and that global inventories will begin to draw in 3Q,"" investment bank Jefferies said on Friday.
Despite oil output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rising to a record 32.82 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, OPEC expects demand for its supplies to be higher still.
This was also visible in physical oil pricing, where Dubai crude, as quoted by price-reporting agency Platts, averaged $46.256 a barrel for June, the highest since August 2015, traders said on Friday.
Outside the Middle East, U.S. oil production declined by 220,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 8.93 million bpd in April, the largest monthly decline since September 2008, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC) bank, citing U.S. government data.
A further easing of monetary policy expected on the back of Asia's slowing economies and because of Britain's vote to leave the European Union was also seen as a reason for financial traders to put money into commodities, which saw one of the strongest quarterly performances in years in the second quarter of 2016.
""The specter of further easing in monetary policies around the world continues to support commodity markets. With quarter-end selling also behind us, investors positioning should start to turn more bullish,"" ANZ Bank said.
Despite the overall bullish outlook for oil prices, Asian economic headwinds remain a concern.
Growth in China's manufacturing sector stalled in June, an official survey showed on Friday, suggesting a spring bounce in activity is fizzling.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) eased to 50.0 in June from 50.1 in May and right at the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
In South Korea, exports fell for an 18th straight month in June, with shipments from the world's sixth-largest exporter down 2.7 percent from a year ago to $45.3 billion.

For the quarter, both the U.S. and international benchmarks surged approximately 25%, as a series of production slowdowns throughout the world helped provide significant upside pressure for crude futures. While investors continued to express widespread concerns related to the global oversupply, their fears were softened somewhat by Canadian wildfires in May and a string of rogue attacks on oil facilities in Southern Nigeria.
In mid-April, investors largely ignored a stalemate at a closely-watched meeting in Doha when Saudi Arabia broke off talks by insisting that Iran take part in a comprehensive pact to freeze production at January levels. At the same time, outages in Iraq and Libya have helped limit OPEC production from hitting fresh record-highs.

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2016 07:20PM ET</span>",Philippine mining set for bumpy ride under Duterte administration,"By Manolo Serapio Jr and Enrico Dela Cruz
MANILA (Reuters) - After the Philippines became the top supplier of nickel ore to China in the last two years, its struggling mining industry may have felt like it was turning a corner. 
But hope in the industry of getting an easier ride exploiting minerals in a country with a strong anti-mining lobby now looks misplaced with the new administration of President Rodrigo Duterte sending tough messages on mining. 
Duterte has warned that he could cancel mining projects causing environmental harm, though he told business leaders last week that he was not against mining per se.
""But in making money out of the precious metals of the earth that belongs to the Filipino people you have to do it right,"" he said.
The country's mining sector, one of the world's largest in the 1970s, has since struggled partly due to environmental rules and policy flip flops, missing much of the mining boom in recent decades and now facing much lower commodity prices.
While not saying that she will ban any form of mining, Regina Lopez, the new mining minister, says it can cause suffering among the poor and has described it as ""madness"" even to consider open pit mining because of the environmental impact.
""We must stop killing our future for the interests of a few"", the staunch environmentalist told Reuters. 
The country has suffered mining disasters, including a 1996 tailings leak at Canadian-owned Marcopper Mining Corp's copper mine in Marinduque that contaminated rivers.
Lopez is expected to outline her plans at a media briefing on Friday.
""SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST""
Ramon Adviento, senior vice president at Global Ferronickel Holdings Inc (PS:FNI), the Philippines' second-biggest nickel ore miner, said the industry was ""shell shocked"" by Lopez' appointment.
""I don't think it means the death of the industry, but what we expect to see is the survival of the fittest,"" he said, adding that there could be a nationwide crackdown on irresponsible miners, likely targeting small-scale producers.
But miners say hardline policies could backfire particularly as the Philippines has become the biggest nickel ore supplier to China after previous top exporter Indonesia banned shipments of unprocessed minerals, shipping 34.3 million tonnes last year.
Mining contributes less than 1 percent to the Philippine economy. Of 9 million hectares identified by the government as having high mineral reserves, only 3 percent is being mined.
""Duterte wants hard investments and new projects invest billions of dollars... and these are done in far-flung areas which goes with the president's call for rural development,"" said Nelia Halcon from the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines. 
The challenge is how to lure back foreign investors.
Mining investment shrank to a three-year low in 2015 below $1 billion, after President Benigno Aquino, Duterte's predecessor, banned new mining permits during his term and sought to increase the state's revenue share from mines.
Commodities giant  Glencore  Plc (L:GLEN) last year quit the $5.9 billion gold-copper Tampakan project in the southern Mindanao island, that has failed to take off after the province where Tampakan is located banned open-pit mining in 2010.
The country only has a handful of foreign investors in mining currently, including Australia's  Oceanagold  Corp (AX:OGC) and Canada's B2Gold (TO:BTO). 

It's going to take some time to reassure foreign investors, which have the capital and technology, that ""the risk is not too high,"" said business consultant Peter Wallace.

Nigeria, an OPEC member which was until recently Africa's biggest oil producer, relies on crude sales for around 70 percent of national income. Most of its oil comes from the impoverished swampland Delta region.
Militants, whose attacks pushed oil production to 30-year lows in recent weeks, have called for a greater share of the country's oil wealth to be passed on to the region's communities and for authorities to clean up areas blighted by oil spills.
""When you get together with other leaders, please pacify the people,"" Buhari told a delegation of community leaders at his residence in the capital, Abuja, adding that he wanted ""as much intelligence as possible on the situation in the Niger Delta"".
""We intend to rebuild this country,"" said Buhari. ""A lot of damage has been done, so I want you to tell the people to be patient.""
Comments made to the group during the meeting, which lasted around an hour, were detailed in an emailed statement issued by the presidency titled ""We'll rebuild the Niger Delta"".
Earlier this month it was announced that the government's military campaign in the Delta would be scaled down, after having been built up a few weeks earlier, to pursue talks with militants.
Last week petroleum ministry sources said a month-long truce had been agreed with militants but the Niger Delta Avengers, who have claimed responsibility for most attacks, later said they did not ""remember"" agreeing to a ceasefire.
However, the Avengers have not carried out an attack since June 16.
Following Thursday's meeting, Buhari's spokesman Femi Adesina said an amnesty agreed in 2009 to end a previous insurgency was ""being studied with a view to determining what had been fulfilled"".
If there were any outstanding issues, these would be addressed, he said.

The president angered former militants earlier this year when he cut the budget assigned to the amnesty program, which offered militants cash and job training in exchange for stopping attacks, by two-thirds.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded between $1,315.00 and $1,325.65 an ounce, before closing at $1,320.25, down 6.75 or 0.51% on the session. Gold has remained near 27-month highs throughout the week after surging nearly $100 an ounce last Friday to eclipse $1,360. Since opening the year around $1,075, Gold has soared nearly 25% over the last six months, amid heightened concerns of a global recession and a delayed interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
Gold likely gained support at $1,247.30, the low from June 8 and was met with resistance at $1,344.00, the high from February 26, 2014.
In London, the Pound fell sharply and U.K. government bond yields sunk to fresh record lows after Carney emphasized that the BOE could lower interest rates in the coming months to safeguard the economy from further shocks emanating from last week's Brexit decision. Earlier this week,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) said in a note to investors that the decision from U.K. voters to approve a departure from the European Union could tip the nation's economy into recession by early-2017. U.K. prime minister David Cameron expects to step down by early-September and plans to leave the option of invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to his successor.
Delivering his second public address since last week's shocking Brexit outcome, Carney noted that there was evidence that ""uncertainty was holding back major economic decisions,"" ahead of the historic vote. The BOE has left interest rates steady since 2012 and held its benchmark interest rate at a record-low of 0.5% in every meeting dating back to 2009. While the BOE meets next in July, Carney hinted that the central bank could wait until August to loosen policy.
""It now seems plausible that uncertainty could remain elevated for some time,” Carney said. ""The economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be needed over the summer.""
Following Carney's comments, GBP/USD extended earlier losses to touch down to an intraday low of 1.3215, down by more than 1.40% on the session. On Monday, the Pound Sterling fell to fresh 31-year lows of 1.3118 against its American counterpart, completing its worst two-day sell-off in history. Since hitting a 2016-yearly high at 1.5020 ahead of the Brexit results, the Pound has tumbled nearly 10% against the Dollar.
In the U.S., initial jobless claims rose by 10,000 to a slightly stronger than expected 268,000. The four-week moving average, however, remained unchanged at 266,750, down roughly 10,000 from its level a month ago. Investors await a critical U.S. employment report on July 8 for further indications on the strength of the labor market. In May, the economy added 38,000 nonfarm payrolls, its lowest monthly total in nearly six years.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 0.50% to an intraday high of 96.46, before falling slightly back to 96.19 in U.S. afternoon trading. After plunging nearly 5% over the first three months of the year, the index is on pace to rebound approximately 1.6% over the second quarter.
Over the first 11 weeks of the year, the precious metal completed its largest sustained weekly inflow since the Financial Crisis, as investors poured $13.4 billion into Gold assets, according to Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).

Natural gas for delivery in August on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 3.3 cent, or 1.15%, to trade at $2.896 per million British thermal units by 14:33GMT, or 10:33AM ET. Prices were at around $2.913 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended June 24 rose by 37 billion cubic feet, below forecasts for an increase of 45 billion.
That compared with builds of 62 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 73 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 78 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.140 trillion cubic feet, 18.5% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 20.3% above the five-year average for this time of year.
A day earlier, gas futures rallied to $2.974, the most since May 2015, as hot summer temperatures across most parts of the U.S. raised expectations for power generation demand to meet air conditioning needs.
Updated weather forecasting models suggested that temperatures may be hotter than normal throughout most of the contiguous U.S. from July 8 through July 12.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Natural gas prices are up nearly 45% since late May as expectations have grown that hot summer weather will lead to heavy demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Elsewhere on the Nymex, crude oil for delivery in August dropped $1.07, or 2.15%, to trade at $48.81 a barrel, while heating oil for August delivery slumped 2.04% to trade at $1.514 per gallon.

(Reuters) - A string of unforeseen events have reduced oil supply, helping to rebalance the world oil market and push price forecasts higher over the last month, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday. 
Wildfires in Canada, attacks on pipelines by rebels in Nigeria and economic crisis in Venezuela have helped cut global oil production by more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) over the last few weeks.
A survey of 27 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude (LCOc1) will average $45.20 per barrel in 2016, up $1.60 from last month's poll. 
This is the fourth straight upward revision in forecasts for the North Sea crude benchmark, which has averaged $41.13 per barrel so far this year. 
""We see Nigeria as a national political situation which is helping the market rebalance even faster than we've predicted before,"" said Raymond James analyst Luana Siegfried.
""Even if further attacks can be prevented this summer, Nigeria's production has still averaged a 60,000 bpd annual decline over the past five years, and the fall-off could accelerate with limited drilling activity,"" Siegfried said.
Economic crisis is expected to worsen in Venezuela, hitting its oil production, with refineries and ports suffering due to shortages and equipment failures.
""Venezuela is a progressively growing risk for the oil market as domestic unrest may translate into large-scale production outages, removing substantial volumes from the oil market,"" said Giorgos Beleris, analyst at Thomson Reuters' Oil Research and Forecasts.
Oil markets have been heavily oversupplied for the last two years with inventories at record highs, but the global glut has begun to ease and demand is widely expected to exceed supply during the second half of this year.
But analysts remain cautious. Surprisingly robust U.S. shale output, rising Iranian oil production and economic turbulence could all disrupt any supply-demand equilibrium.
Few economists see long-term impact on oil from Britain's vote to leave the European Union. 
Oil prices tumbled by around 5 percent on Friday but have since recovered from the initial shock, aided by a potential oil workers strike in Norway.     
Brent futures are expected to average $58.20 per barrel in 2017, rising to $65.20 in 2018, the Reuters poll showed.
The survey forecast U.S. WTI crude futures (CLc1) would average $43.90 a barrel in 2016, up $1.90 from last month's poll. U.S. crude oil has averaged $39.70 this year so far.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell towards $50 a barrel on Thursday, pressured by higher Nigerian output and concern about the economic outlook following Britain's vote to leave the European Union last week.
Returning Nigerian supply will put pressure on prices, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said, adding that outages caused by Canadian wildfires would virtually end by September. 
Norwegian supply could be hit by a threatened workers' strike, however. 
Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 48 cents a barrel at $50.13 as of 0856 GMT, having risen in the two previous sessions. U.S. crude (CLc1) was down 48 cents to $49.40.
""Supply is gradually improving in Canada, although in Norway we still have some risk,"" said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix, who added a weak gasoline crack was weighing on crude.
""I don't think the case is there for $30 oil, but to go to $60 you need to see stronger support from the products.""
Brent has risen by 85 percent since reaching a 12-year low in January, supported by expectations that a glut that has been weighing on prices since 2014 would start to ease and by unplanned losses from Canada to Nigeria.
Nonetheless, the return of some of that oil and concern over a slowing economy, compounded by Britain's vote to leave the European Union, are weighing near-term, analysts said.
Adding to economic concerns, industrial output in Asia's second-largest economy, Japan, slid in May at the fastest rate in three months to its lowest level since June 2013.
On the supply front, oil production in Nigeria has risen to about 1.9 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.6 million, due to repairs and a lack of new major attacks on pipelines in the Delta region, the state oil company said on Monday.
""Short-term supply conditions look overwhelmingly bearish,"" said Georgi Slavov, global head of energy, iron ore and shipping research at Marex Spectron, in a report on Wednesday.
In Norway, oil companies and trade unions began two-day wage talks in a bid to avert a strike that would initially cut the country's oil and gas output by 12 percent, the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association said.

Prices of the yellow metal surged to a 27-month peak of $1,362.60 last Friday, after a shock U.K. vote to exit the European Union sent investors flooding into bullion and other safe haven assets.
The news raised concerns that other countries might leave the union and that global growth would come under significant pressure, while the actual timeframe of the U.K. departure from the EU remained unclear.
But so far the U.K. has refrained from invoking Article 50, the treaty measure that would jump start the two year deadline for the U.K. to leave the European Union.
Investors will be watching a speech by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney at 15:00GMT, or 11:00AM ET, when he is expected to address concerns over the U.K.'s decision to leave the EU.
Gold remained supported as market players all but ruled out further rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year in the aftermath of Britain’s shock vote to leave the EU. In fact, futures markets are now reflecting a chance that the Fed could actually cut interest rates before the end of the year, instead of hiking them.
According to the CME Fed Watch tool, there’s currently a 0% probability of a Fed rate hike in July and a 3% probability of a rate cut.
The precious metal is up almost 25% for the year to date, boosted by concerns over global growth and as market players pushed back expectations for the next U.S. rate hike.
Investors looked ahead to key U.S. data later in the day to gauge the health of the world's largest economy. The U.S. is to release weekly jobless claims data at 12:30GMT, or 8:30AM ET. Afterwards, data on business activity in the Chicago region is due at 13:45GMT or 9:45AM ET

1445,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2016 03:48PM ET</span>",Oil up 4 percent on U.S. crude draw; Brent back above $50,"By Barani Krishnan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices surged 4 percent on Wednesday, with Brent settling above the psychological $50 a barrel mark, after a larger-than-expected drawdown in U.S. crude inventories.
It was a second straight day of gains for oil, which has risen nearly 8 percent since Monday's settlement to recover almost all of what it lost after Britain's shock vote to exit the European Union.
Fading concerns over the so-called Brexit, potential for an oil workers' strike in Norway and a crisis in Venezuela's energy sector were among factors supporting Wednesday's rally. 
While spot contracts in Brent and U.S. crude surged, the premium for longer-dated oil spiked too as traders bet crude in storage will fetch better prices in coming months.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that crude stockpiles fell 4.1 million barrels in the week to June 24, the sixth consecutive week of drawdowns. 
That was more than the 2.4 million barrels expected by analysts in a Reuters poll.
Brent crude futures settled up $2.03, or 4.2 percent, at $50.61 per barrel. It hit a near one-week high of $50.74 during the session.
U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures also closed up $2.03, or 4.2 percent, at $49.88. WTI's session high was $50.
""Aside from improving market fundamentals, bulls are also eager to keep prices at around $50 as we begin the second half,"" said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.
Among longer-dated oil futures, the discount for December WTI versus December 2017 held near the almost three month high above $2.40 a barrel seen on Tuesday.
""We played on that curve to widen out and it was good for us,"" said Tariq Zahir, crude spreads trader for Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.
The discount in nearby oil versus forward, known as contango, has widened as traders took advantage of cheap freight to store oil on tankers on expectations of further price gains by 2017 as a crude glut abates.
Despite that, some were bearish on their longer-term view of oil as the EIA also reported an unseasonably large rise of 1.4 million barrels in gasoline stockpiles versus analysts' expectations for a 58,000-barrel draw.
On the East Coast, gasoline stockpiles rose to record levels.

""I am still unimpressed with overall crude draws for June,"" said Scott Shelton, energy futures broker with ICAP (LON:IAP) in Durham, North Carolina. ""With 16.7 million barrels per day of crude runs and production declines, we should have larger drawdowns for Q2. That has simply not happened.""

1449,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 29, 2016 09:36AM ET</span>",Natural gas futures extend rally to hit highest level since May 2015,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures rallied for the third straight session on Wednesday, to hit the highest level in more than a year as hot summer temperatures across most parts of the U.S. raised expectations for power generation demand to meet air conditioning needs.
Updated weather forecasting models suggested that temperatures may be hotter than normal throughout most of the contiguous U.S. from July 8 through July 12.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning. 
Natural gas for delivery in August on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to an intraday peak of $2.974 per million British thermal units, the most since May 21. It last stood at $2.891 by 14:35GMT, or 10:35AM ET, up 0.1 cents, or 0.03%.
A day earlier, gas futures surged 14.9 cents, or 5.44%. Natural gas prices are up nearly 45% since late May as expectations have grown that hot summer weather will lead to heavy demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Meanwhile, traders looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U.S. gas inventories to gauge the strength of demand for the fuel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration's storage report slated for release on Thursday is expected to show a build of 48 billion cubic feet for the week ending June 24.
That compared with builds of 62 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 73 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 78 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.103 trillion cubic feet, 19.9% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 21.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
Elsewhere on the Nymex, crude oil for delivery in August advanced 49 cents, or 1.02%, to trade at $48.34 a barrel, while heating oil for August delivery tacked on 1.43% to trade at $1.505 per gallon.

Updated forecasts released Monday said temperatures may be hotter than normal throughout most of the contiguous U.S. from July 8 through July 12.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning. 
Natural gas for delivery in August on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to an intraday peak of $2.865 per million British thermal units, the most since August 13. It last stood at $2.825 by 14:32GMT, or 10:32AM ET, up 8.4 cents, or 3.06%.
A day earlier, gas futures rose 4.7 cents, or 1.74%. Natural gas prices are up nearly 40% since late May as expectations have grown that hot summer weather will lead to heavy demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Meanwhile, traders looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U.S. gas inventories to gauge the strength of demand for the fuel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration's storage report  slated for release on Thursday is expected to show a build in a range between 43 to 53 billion cubic feet for the week ending June 24.
That compared with builds of 62 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 73 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 78 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.103 trillion cubic feet, 19.9% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 21.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

Later Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute will release its estimates of crude and refined product stockpiles in the U.S. by the end of last week. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Energy releases more closely-watched figures.
Overnight, U.S. crude futures slid to near six week lows on Monday, as a broadly stronger dollar weighed on global oil prices while the shockwaves of last week's historic Brexit referendum continued to be felt worldwide.
On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for September delivery wavered between $47.31 and $49.48 a barrel, before settling at $47.85, down 1.24 or 2.43% on the day. Crude futures have slumped by approximately 8% since last Friday's shocking decision by U.K. voters to approve a departure from the European Union.
Despite the considerable two-day sell-off, U.S. crude futures are still up by more than 65% from their level in mid-February when they slid to a 13-year low at $26.05 a barrel.
In Monday's session, investors continued to pile into safe-haven assets such as government bonds, gold and the dollar, as the British Pound fell an additional 3% to touch a fresh 31-year low against the greenback. On Monday afternoon, Standard & Poor's lowered its credit rating on U.K's sovereign debt from AAA to AA, as it weighed the possibility of future contagion effects if other nations in the EU decide to leave the European bloc. In lowering its outlook for U.K. bonds to negative, S&P cited heightened risks of market deterioration on external financial conditions, as well as the wider constitutional issues surrounding a potential U.K. departure by Northern Island or Scotland.
In last week's referendum, Scotland voters backed the Remain campaign by a 62-38% margin, triggering concerns that the country could look to leave the U.K. in the coming months. Shortly after the results were tallied, Scotland first minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would seek a re-revote of the nation's 2014 independence referendum from the U.K., which failed by a 55-45%. In the months leading to the 2014 referendum, Scotland's Oil and Gas Analytical Bulletin predicted that production in Scottish offshore oil fields could generate as much as £57 billion by 2018.
Also on Monday, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:NYSE:GS) said in a note to investors that last week's Brexit vote could tip the U.K. into mild recession by early next year.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for August delivery rose 0.25% to $1,328.00 a troy ounce.
Silver futures for August delivery gained 0.30% to $17.820 a troy ounce, while copper futures for September delivery held flat at $2.129 a pound.
Overnight, gold closed slightly higher on Monday, remaining near two-year highs, as investors continued to engage in a flight to safety amid the fallout of last week's stunning decision by voters in the U.K. to approve a departure from the European Union.
It came one session after gold soared nearly $100 an ounce to $1,362.45, as markets worldwide were jolted by a surprising outcome in the historic Brexit referendum in the wee hours of Friday morning. Since opening the year near $1,075 an ounce, the precious metal has soared nearly 25% over the calendar year. With three days left in the month of June, Gold is on pace for its strongest first half of a year in more than a decade.
In London, U.K. prime minister David Cameron took steps to calm voters nationwide and markets overall after the British Pound fell sharply by more than 3% to tumble to fresh 31-year lows against the U.S. Dollar. At the close of euro area markets, GBP/USD stood at 1.3204, down 3.45%. The Pound Sterling has fallen by approximately 10% since it became apparent that the Leave campaign would prevail last Friday.
In an address before Parliament on Monday afternoon, Cameron emphasized that while the result of the referendum was not the outcome he preferred, it is a decision that he will respect along with the rest of his cabinet. Cameron also said that the U.K. has created a new civil service designed specifically for withdrawal discussions from the EU. While Cameron said last Friday that he plans to leave office by October, his administration announced on Monday that a new prime minister will be put in place by September 2. Cameron emphasized that the domestic economy remains on solid footing due to low, stable inflation and a comparatively low unemployment rate.
In addition, he told Parliament that the financial system is ""substantially more resilient"" than it was six years, as capital requirements remain 10 times higher than from the Financial Crisis. The U.K. prime minister also reiterated that the Bank of England has set aside an additional £250 billion in liquidity to support the nation's banks and financial markets.
""It is clear that markets are volatile, some companies are considering their investments and we know this will be far from plain sailing. However, we should take confidence from the fact that Britain is ready to confront what the future holds for us from a position of strength,"" Cameron said in his speech.
""The markets may not have been expecting the Referendum results but the Treasury, the Bank of England and our other financial authorities have spent the last few months putting in place robust contingency plans. The bank stress tests have shown that UK institutions have enough capital and liquidity reserves to withstand a scenario more severe than the country currently faces.""
Notably, Cameron told Parliament that he will not immediately invoke Article 50, a provision of the Lisbon Treaty, which initiates a two-year process for a member state to leave the European bloc. Though Cameron is expected to deliver a dinner speech on Tuesday at an EU Summit in Brussels, he will not take part in discussions with leaders from the bloc's 27 other nations a day later.

1468,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2016 02:50PM ET</span>",Iraq's southern oil exports seen steady through 2016 at 3.162 million bpd,"By Aref Mohammed
BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Oil exports from Iraq's southern ports have averaged 3.162 million barrels per day (bpd) so far this month, down slightly from May due to maintenance work and rising demand for fuel oil used in power generation, a senior oil official said.
The exports, including 850,000 barrels of Basra Heavy, are expected to hold steady through the end of the year, Hayan Abdulghani Abdulzahra, the head of state-owned South Oil Company (SOC), told Reuters in an interview late on Sunday.
""With the start of summer, demand for crude oil from power stations and refineries has increased to around 550,000 barrels per day, and this comes at the expense of exports,"" he said.
Power stations and refineries had been using 400,000 bpd before high temperatures boosted electricity consumption, he said.
OPEC's second-largest producer aims to increase its southern oil storage capacity to 14 million bpd by the first quarter of 2018, from 11.5 million currently, to help cope with export bottlenecks caused by bad weather and to absorb an expected rise in output, Abdulzahra said.
The country plans to bring a fourth single point mooring (SPM) facility online by mid-2017 to boost export capacity from southern terminals to 4.5 million bpd from 3.6 million currently, he said.
Iraq last year was OPEC's fastest source of supply growth, boosting output by more than 500,000 barrels per day, despite spending cuts and conflict with Islamic State militants.
A collapse in global prices (LCOc1), which at $47 a barrel are less than half their level of two years ago, has hit revenue for the government which relies on oil for nearly all its income.
The price drop has raised concern that Iraq's oil output growth could slow, or stall. Indeed, oil companies have warned Iraq that projects will be delayed if the government insists on drastic spending cuts this year.
Abdulzahra said more talks were needed with ExxonMobil (N:XOM) and PetroChina (HK:0857), which Iraq approached last year about a multi-billion dollar project to boost output from Nahr Bin Umar and Artawi, two smaller southern oilfields now producing 35,000 and 17,000 bpd respectively.
""We reached an initial agreement that production from both fields should reach 550,000 barrels per day,"" he said, without specifying a timeframe.
SOC is seeking investments from the two companies to build infrastructure needed to raise output at fields it operates.
Most of Iraq's production comes from five giant fields. Abdulzahra said production from BP's (L:BP) Rumaila oilfield, Iraq's largest, is currently at 1.45 million bpd, more than 60,000 barrels higher than last year. 

West Qurna 1, developed by  Exxon Mobil , is producing 450,000 bpd, while Lukoil's (MM:LKOH) West Qurna 2 produces 405,000 bpd, he said. Output from Shell's (L:RDSa) Majnoon is at 220,000 bpd and at Eni's (MI:ENI) Zubair at 360,000 barrels.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - With gasoline costing the least since 2005, U.S. motorists will hit the road this upcoming July 4 holiday weekend in record numbers, according to the nation's largest motoring group. 
AAA projects 36.3 million people will drive 50 miles (80 km) or more from home during the holiday period, the third consecutive year of record-breaking forecasts. That is up 1.2 percent from last year, continuing what is expected to be a historic summer driving season. 
Despite recent seasonal increases, gasoline prices remain well below the levels of recent years. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline is $2.31, which is 47 cents less than one year ago. AAA expects most U.S. drivers will pay the lowest Independence Day gas prices since 2005. 
“Spurred by the lowest gas prices since 2005, more people than ever are planning to travel this Independence Day weekend,” said Marshall Doney, AAA president and CEO. ""“We are well on our way for 2016 to be a record-breaking year for summertime travel.""
Including airplanes and trains, AAA projects nearly 43 million Americans will travel this Independence Day weekend, the highest July 4 travel volume on record and five million more travelers than over Memorial Day weekend. The holiday travel period is defined as Thursday, June 30 to Monday, July 4.
Americans used an average of 9.72 million barrels of gasoline a day in the four weeks ending June 17, the highest level recorded since the Energy Information Administration started collecting weekly consumption data in 1991.
The most recent data from the U.S. Department of Transportation shows the U.S. road renaissance, spurred in part by the crude oil rout and lower unemployment, remains strong.
U.S. road travel rose 2.6 percent in April, compared with a year ago, according to data released last week by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
The April figures mark the 26th consecutive month of year-over-year increases in vehicle miles traveled, according to DOT data, reflecting the surge in U.S. driving activity fueled by low pump prices.

Driving in the United States is closely watched since the country accounts for about 10 percent of global gasoline demand.

Gold earlier hit highs of $1,339.3.
The precious metal settled at $1,318.50 a troy ounce on Friday, up 4.39% after hitting peaks of $1,358.20. It was gold’s largest one day gain since September 2013 and the highest close since August 2014.
The U.K. voted to leave the EU in a referendum on Thursday, triggering historic falls in stocks and currencies and sending investors to seek safety in the yen, gold and low-risk government debt.
The precious metal is up 25% for the year to date, boosted by concerns over global growth and the adoption of negative interest rates by central banks.
Gold has also been boosted as the Federal Reserve cut projections for the number of interest rate increases planned for this year.

Global markets plunged on Friday as the decision by the U.K. to exit the EU shocked investors and traders around the world expecting the opposite result.
Oil prices had risen earlier Monday as analysts said Brexit would have little impact on supply and demand in the global oil market.
The U.K. accounts for less than 2% of the world’s oil demand.
But the pound fell to fresh 31-year lows on Monday, sending the dollar soaring.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.96% at 96.55.
A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for traders using other currencies, typically pressuring prices lower.

1475,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2016 07:30AM ET</span>",Oil prices ease again after Brexit vote,"By Ahmad Ghaddar
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Monday as market participants absorbed the shock of Britain's vote to leave the European Union though some analysts said Brexit would have a limited impact on global fuel demand.
Brent crude futures were down 35 cents at $48.06 a barrel by 1123 GMT. U.S. crude was down 42 cents at $47.22 a barrel.
Both crude benchmarks slumped about 5 percent on Friday amid plunging global financial markets after the British referendum results gave an unexpected 52 percent to 48 percent victory to the campaign to take Britain out of the EU.
Oil prices rose slightly early on Monday as analysts said Britain's EU exit would have very little impact on physical oil trading - before slipping back later. 
""If we assume a 2 percent drop in UK GDP in response to the exit vote, which is on the high end of our economists' estimates, then UK oil demand would likely be reduced by 1 percent or 16,000 barrels per day, which is a 0.016 percent hit to global demand. This is extremely small on any measure,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol also downplayed the impact of Brexit on global oil demand. 
""Since a big chunk of oil demand is from emerging countries, namely Asia, I don't see a major impact (of Brexit) on oil demand,"" he told Reuters.
PVM's Tamas Varga said given Brexit's limited impact on global oil demand in the foreseeable future, a tightening in the oil market remained on the cards in the second half of the year.
""If one subscribes to this view then it is not difficult to conclude that the Brexit-triggered oil price sell-off should not last and the downside is limited,"" he said.
Of more concern to the market on Monday was a growing glut of refined products.
""For near term oil, we remain most concerned about product oversupply, China demand, the macro outlook, and the likely return of production,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
Chinese refiners have responded to the Asian oil products glut by exporting record amounts of gasoline and diesel fuel into regional markets, eroding refinery profit margins and swelling storage.
Morgan Stanley said the larger political and policy repercussions of a Brexit could not be ignored.
""Europe is a big trading partner for the United States and China, which could lead to knock on global effects, and a stronger dollar is generally unhelpful for demand,"" Morgan Stanley said. 

""In a high stress case, our economists see global GDP slowing to 2.7 percent in 2017 - nearly a global recession.""

The precious metal is up almost 25% for the year to date, boosted by concerns over global growth and the adoption of negative interest rates by central banks.
Gold has also been boosted as the Federal Reserve cut projections for the number of interest rate increases planned for this year.

1483,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2016 06:36AM ET</span>",China aims to cut steel capacity by 45 million tonnes in 2016: state planner,"TIANJIN, China (Reuters) - China plans to cut its steel production capacity this year by 45 million tonnes and lower coal output capacity by 280 million tonnes, the head of the country's top economic planner said on Sunday.
The capacity cuts will involve relocating 700,000 workers in the coal sector, and 180,000 workers in the steel industry, Xu Shaoshi, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said at the World Economic Forum in the northern city of Tianjin. Xu said he was very confident that China will achieve the 2016 targets. 
""The most urgent task is reducing excess capacity,"" Xu said. 
""I'm very confident that we can achieve the targets.""
China has vowed to tackle price-sapping supply gluts in major industrial sectors, and said in February that it would close 100 million-150 million tonnes of steel capacity and 500 million tonnes of coal production within three to five years.
China plans to allocate a total of 100 billion yuan to help local authorities and state-owned firms finance layoffs in the two sectors this year and in 2017, with 20 percent of the total used to reward high achievers.
Layoffs from the two sectors are expected to total 1.8 million people, according to official estimates.
Xu said China's overall leverage levels are under control and the government may roll out policy steps to ""actively and steadily"" reduce corporate debt levels, which is the main problem, in the near term.
China's total debt load rose to 250 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) last year, and the IMF recently warned that the high corporate debt ratio of 145 percent of GDP could lead to slower economic growth if not addressed.
The government will forge ahead with supply-side reforms while appropriately expanding aggregate demand to ensure economic growth to be within a reasonable range, Xu said.

He reiterated the government's target of achieving annual average growth of at least 6.5 percent between 2006 and 2020.

1485,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2016 06:22PM ET</span>","U.S. states, Rockefellers clash with U.S. House panel on Exxon climate probes","By Terry Wade
HOUSTON (Reuters) - With a number of U.S. states proceeding with investigations of  Exxon Mobil  Corp's (N:XOM) record on climate change, the attorney general of Massachusetts and investment funds of the Rockefeller family on Friday told a Congressional committee it lacked powers to oversee those probes.
The pushback is the latest chapter in a high-stakes fight between the world's largest publicly traded oil company and a coalition of state attorneys general who have said they would go after Exxon to try and force action to tackle climate change. 
The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology last week reiterated demands that state attorneys general hand over any records of consultations the prosecutors had with outside environmental groups before their probes were opened.
Republicans on the committee have said about 20 state officials overreached when they jointly said in March they would participate in inquiries into whether Exxon executives misled the public by contradicting research from company scientists that spelled out the threats of climate change.
State officials have said the committee has no right to get involved.
""The Committee lacks authority to interfere with an investigation by the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office into possible violations of Massachusetts law by ExxonMobil,"" said a letter to the committee from the office of Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey that was seen by Reuters.
In another letter to the House panel seen by Reuters, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Family Fund, two investment funds that have been critical of fossil fuels linked to climate change, said the committee's request ""imperiled the funds' First Amendment rights"" and said ""Congress's investigatory power is not unlimited.""
Last week, Exxon asked a federal court to throw out a subpoena that would force it to hand over decades of documents on climate change to Healey's office.

Both sides in the standoff have sought to use the First Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom speech and freedom of assembly, among other protections, to press their cases. 
The House committee has complained the inquiries risk stifling free speech and scientific inquiry, and that state officials were coordinating with special interest groups.
Exxon, which declined to comment on Friday, has repeatedly said that it has acknowledged the reality of climate change for years and communicated this to investors.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2016 05:49PM ET</span>",Hedge funds added to bullish oil bets just before plunge on Brexit,"(Reuters) - Hedge funds betting on summer gasoline demand raised their bullish bets on U.S. crude futures this week, just before the market's crash on Friday on Britain's shock decision to leave the European Union, trade data showed.
Money managers, including hedge funds and other big speculators, boosted their combined net longs in U.S. crude futures and options in both New York and London by 18,000 contracts to 216,003 contracts in the week to June 21, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) showed.
It was the first rise in three weeks in net longs held by the group as U.S. crude's benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures began to rise toward the psychological $50 a barrel mark after choppy trades the previous fortnight.
But the higher price wagers appeared ill-timed given WTI's 5 percent plunge on Friday to settle at $47.64 after the unexpected British exit, or Brexit, from the EU. The drop was the largest in a day since February.
""It couldn't have been worse luck for the managed money crowd that the market tanked the same week it decided to build on its longs,"" said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. 
""Still, I think there's significant appetite out to build on new longs, with U.S. gasoline demand near decade-highs and supply-demand imbalances continuing to tighten."" [EIA/S]
Oil has had difficulty staying above $50 since it crossed that barrier in late May. Much of the skepticism has been on whether supply outages that propelled prices since February have made a big enough dent on a global crude glut.
Prices have also been rangebound on worries that U.S. crude output will increase again if prices rise above $50. The U.S. oil rig count finally dropped this week after rising in three previous weeks. [RIG/U]
Some analysts think Friday's rout could be the precursor to a larger oil selloff that could derail the market's three-month long recovery.
""Higher risk aversion is likely to make it hard for prices to regain the $50 per barrel mark in anything like the near future,"" said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Frankfurt's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Others disagreed.
""The current move to the downside in oil prices comes at a time when the oil complex was overbought and the fundamental picture was in the midst of indicating that the global market is rebalancing,"" said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York.
""Unless there are clear signs that the system is breaking down, a stabilization move is likely to occur in the short term.""

LIMA (Reuters) - President-elect Pedro Pablo Kuczynski wants China to help transform Peru into a metals refining hub to boost the Andean country's key mining exports as prices for them slump, the incoming finance minister said.
Alfredo Thorne told Reuters that some Chinese companies have already signaled interest in partnering in developing new refineries, part of Kuczynski's plans to boost infrastructure investments to rev up sluggish economic growth.
Kuczynski, a 77-year-old former investment banker and prime minister, plans to discuss the proposal in detail with officials in China on his first trip abroad as Peru's president after taking office July 28, Thorne said.
""Pedro Pablo is very clear on this. Today we export a lot of rocks with our raw materials and some of those minerals should be refined in Peru,"" Thorne said in an interview.
Thorne said Peru could eventually refine copper from the world's top producer, neighboring Chile. ""We have to look at our competitive advantages, look at how to partner with the Chinese to ensure benefits for both countries.""
China is Peru's top trading partner and owns two major new copper mines in Peru, Chinalco Mining Corp International's (HK:3668) Toromocho deposit and  MMG  Ltd's (HK:1208) Las Bambas project.
Thorne, a former director at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and the only future minister that Kuczynski has announced as part of his cabinet, said it was too soon to say how many or what kind of refineries might be built.
Peru is set to become the world's No.2 copper producer this year, replacing China, but has just one copper refinery, which is owned and operated by Southern Copper Corp (N:SCCO).
A slew of copper mines in southern Peru, including Las Bambas and Hudbay Minerals Inc's (TO:HBM) Constancia project, send concentrates abroad for processing. 
Peru is also a major producer of zinc, silver and gold. 
The economy grew 3.3 percent last year, down from rates topping 6 percent when mineral prices surged in the past decade.

Thorne said growth could ""easily"" quicken to his goal of 5 percent per year as early as 2017, as domestic demand firms on rising public investments. Thorne said he was preparing a list of 10-15 infrastructure projects worth at least $8 billion that will be fast-tracked to clear obstacles slowing their development. The projects include Brazilian construction company Odebrecht's $5 billion natural gas pipeline, snagged on financing, and stalled plans to expand the airport in Lima. ""We're not pushing projects out as quickly as we need to, and lag far behind in infrastructure,"" Thorne said.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for August delivery traded between $46.75 and $50.44 a barrel before closing at $47.64, down 2.47 or 4.93% on the session. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for August delivery wavered between $47.55 and $51.19 a barrel, before settling at $48.38, down $2.53 or 4.97% on the day. After rallying slightly in the U.S. morning session, crude settled near session-lows as selling pressure intensified in the final minutes before the close. The U.S. crude settlement was delayed slightly following the late swing in prices, Reuters reported.
As the Leave campaign took a resounding lead in the wee hours of Friday morning, both the international and U.S. benchmarks of crude tumbled more than 6%, falling to their lowest levels since mid-May. With the considerable losses, the front month contract for crude erased all of their gains from the last week when they surged more than $4 a barrel.
On Friday morning, U.K. prime minister David Cameron announced intentions to step down by October after polls showed that the Exit camp prevailed by a 52-48% margin. Leading up to the historic referendum, a host of major oil companies issued stark warnings on the dire implications of a UK departure. Besides complicating the free travel arrangements by UK workers employed by euro area oil companies, oil executives have expressed concern on the impact of heightened trade barriers between the UK and other top countries in the the EU. Consequently, large sums of UK oil workers could require non-EU citizenship to work abroad, a development, which could increase operating costs for top energy companies.
Other industry insiders, such as former  BP  (LON:BP) CEO John Browne, said in the final hours before polls closed that the cost of uncertainty from leaving could be so high that the U.K. may never recover. In late-May, The Telegraph reported that North Sea brent oil created an annual loss for U.K. taxpayers for the first time since the Treasury began maintaining an oil balance sheet in 1968. Leading economists also warned that a Brexit vote could tip the euro area into recession, dampening demand for oil.
Elsewhere, oil services firm Baker Hughes said in its weekly rig count report that U.S. oil rigs fell by seven to 330, marking its first decline in four weeks. The combined oil and gas rig count fell by three to 421.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 2.5% to a three-month high at 96.70, before falling back to 95.59 in U.S. afternoon trading. The index posted its strongest one-day move in more than five years.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery closed at $1,319.75, up $56.55 or 4.48% on the session. At session-highs, the front month contract for Gold surged nearly $100 an ounce to $1,362.45, its highest level since March, 2014 after major broadcasting networks called for a resounding victory by the Leave campaign just after 1:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. Had the precious metal held onto the gains, Gold would have posted its strongest one-day session since the Financial Crisis.
Gold likely gained support at $1,247.30, the low from June 8 and was met with resistance at $1,344.00, the high from February 26, 2014.
In London, U.K. prime minister David Cameron announced intentions to step down by October after U.K. voters decided to leave the EU by a 52-48% margin. Hours earlier as a Leave vote became increasingly likely, the Pound fell as much as 10% against the U.S. dollar to an intraday low of 1.3231, its lowest level in three decades. While top global central bankers convened in Basel to execute an emergency contingency plan, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the Bank has set aside £250 billion of additional liquidity and will act if necessary to help support the British economy.
""Inevitably, there will be a period of uncertainty and adjustment following this result,"" Carney said on Friday morning. ""There will be no initial change in the way our people can travel, in the way our goods can move or the way our services can be sold.""
""It will take some time for the United Kingdom to establish new relationships with Europe and the rest of the world, some market and economic volatility can be expected as this process unfolds. But we are well prepared for this…The Bank will not hesitate to take additional measures as required as those markets adjust and the UK economy moves forward.""
As investors exited from their positions in the Pound and euro area financial stocks, they engaged in a flight to safety to Gold, low-risk government bonds and safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc and the U.S. Dollar. At one point, USD/JPY plunged to 99.02, its lowest level since November, 2013, before rallying to 102.28 (down 3.66%). In Tokyo, Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the Finance Ministry will monitor currency fluctuations more carefully, while the BOJ had swap lines in place to offer liquidity, if needed.
Meanwhile, EUR/CHF fell to a 10-month low at 1.0623, before paring the losses when the Swiss National Bank (SNB) confirmed that it intervened in foreign exchange markets and sold the safe-haven Franc to help stabilize the currency. Earlier, the Swiss Franc staged its strongest one-day rally since the SNB removed its currency peg to the euro last January.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 2.5% to a three-month high at 96.70, before falling back to 95.59 in U.S. afternoon trading. The index posted its strongest one-day move in more than five years.
On Friday morning, the Federal Reserve said that it is carefully monitoring market developments in cooperation with other central banks, in the wake of the results of the U.K. referendum. It came days after Fed chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that a U.K. departure from the EU could have serious repercussions for financial markets worldwide.
""The Federal Reserve is prepared to provide dollar liquidity through its existing swap lines with central banks, as necessary, to address pressures in global funding markets, which could have adverse implications for the U.S. economy,"" the U.S. central bank said in a statement.
Last week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said the potential of a victory by the Leave campaign played a role in its decision to leave interest rates unchanged at its June monetary policy meeting. The FOMC has held the target range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a level between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its four meetings this year.
The CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool responded to Friday's market developments by taking a September rate hike off the table. The CME Group also said there is a 20.9% probability the FOMC could raise the Fed Funds Rate to 0.50-0.75% in December, down from 42.6% one day earlier. In addition, the CME Group said there is a 10.5% chance the FOMC could lower rates to the zero-bound range in September. Last December, the FOMC halted a seven-year zero interest rate policy by raising short-term rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices slumped by more than 6 percent on Friday after Britain voted to leave the European Union, raising fears of a broader economic slowdown that could reduce demand.
Financial markets have been worried for months about what Brexit, or a British exit from the European Union, would mean for Europe's future, but were clearly not fully factoring in the risk of a leave vote.
British Prime Minister David Cameron, who campaigned to remain in the EU, said he would stand down by October.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was down $2.45 at $48.46 a barrel at 1004 GMT. U.S. crude (CLc1) was down $2.39 at $47.72 a barrel. 
Earlier in the day, both contracts were down by more than $3, or over 6 percent, the biggest intra-day declines for both since April 18, when a meeting of top global oil producers failed to agree on an output freeze.
Sterling  sank 10 percent in value to its weakest since the mid-1980s. The FTSE 100 (FTSE) fell more than 8 percent at the open, with banks among the hardest hit.
""The global uncertainly that (the vote) is likely to unleash is likely to have a potentially negative effect on GDP growth, not only in the UK, but potentially in Europe,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst CMC markets.

The U.K. voted by a substantial margin to exit the EU, with the Leave side winning 52% of the vote, against 48% to remain.
A stronger dollar also put downward pressure on black gold, as crude becomes more expensive for buyers using other currencies. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, jumped 1.97% to 95.17 after hitting overnight highs of 96.70.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for August delivery slumped $2.06, or 4.05%, to trade at $48.85 a barrel by 08:32GMT, or 4:32AM ET.
On Thursday, London-traded Brent futures closed up $1.06, or 2.11%, to settle at $50.94, near session highs of $50.95, in the final hours of the Brexit vote.
Elsewhere, crude oil for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange $2.00, or 3.99%, to trade at $48.11 a barrel.
A day earlier, New York-traded oil prices traded up 99 cents, or 2.02%, to close at $50.13.
Despite Friday’s losses, U.S. crude futures are up nearly 85% since falling to 13-year lows at $26.05 on February 11 as a decline in U.S. shale production boosted sentiment. However, with prices now at levels that make drilling economical for some firms, the rig count might start rising soon and the decline in U.S. production may slow.
In that light, energy traders looked ahead to Friday's rig count report from Baker Hughes for further indications on whether U.S. shale producers are continuing to return online, as oil prices stabilize. A week earlier, the U.S. oil rig count rose by nine to 337 for the week ending on June 10, representing their third straight weekly increase.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.
Meanwhile, Brent's premium to the WTI crude contract stood at 74 cents a barrel, compared to a gap of 81 cents by close of trade on Wednesday."

The shock came from a crushing victory for Leave in Sunderland in the north-east of England, and only a narrow win for Remain in the neighbouring City of Newcastle. The results were markedly stronger for Leave than pundits had expected, but they may just be an early indicator of widely divergent regional voting patterns.

MANILA (Reuters) - Gold rose more than 1 percent and oil futures dropped below $50 a barrel amid sharp price swings on Friday, as official results so far from a British referendum showed a tight race between campaigns to remain in or leave the European Union.
Copper came off a seven-week top, but losses were marginal while grains stabilized as initial results from a referendum on Britain's 43-year EU membership poured in. China-traded commodities barely reacted, with actively traded iron ore and rebar futures largely steady.
""It's like a rollercoaster ride in the markets right now, but it's too early to tell which side is going to win,"" said Bob Takai, president at Sumitomo Corp Global Research.
With results in from 132 of 382 voting districts plus partial BBC Northern Irish figures, those in favor of ending Britain's 43-year EU membership were on 50.4 percent of the vote, while those wanting to stay were on 49.6 percent, based on Reuters calculation.
Spot gold  was up 1.6 percent at $1,275.06 an ounce by 0213 GMT, after rising as much as 2.4 percent earlier to $1,285.11. 
Gold's gains tracked those in other safe-havens such as bonds, while sterling sank in Asian trade. [MKTS/GLOB] 
""We're finding safe-haven assets being bid up and in this case because it's much nearer to the event the demand for gold could be rather high,"" said Vishnu Varathan, senior economist at Mizuho Bank. 
Gold had benefitted from fears of the 'Brexit' vote winning the referendum ahead of Thursday's polls, with some concerned it could tip Europe back into a recession, putting more pressure on the global economy.
That could curb demand for raw materials from oil to copper, dragging down prices again just as many were regaining favor in recent weeks.
If Britain becomes the first state to leave the European Union, it would be the biggest blow to the 28-nation bloc since its foundation.
The EU would be stripped of its leading free-market advocate and one of its two main military powers, and could face calls for similar votes by anti-EU politicians in other countries.
Gold in terms of sterling  and euro (XAUEUR=R) also rose, but was well off session-peaks.
But analysts say it may still be a whippy session for global markets as results of the referendum come in.
""The one thing that we can be sure of is volatility,"" said Varathan of Mizuho Bank.
U.S. crude (CLc1) was down $1.07, or 2.1 percent at $49.04 a barrel and Brent oil (LCOc1) slipped $1.12, or 2.2 percent, to $49.79 a barrel. [O/R]

Natural gas for delivery in July on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 3.1 cent, or 1.2%, to trade at $2.645 per million British thermal units by 14:32GMT, or 10:32AM ET. Prices were at around $2.681 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended June 17 rose by 62 billion cubic feet, above forecasts for an increase of 58 billion.
That compared with builds of 69 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 73 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 88 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.103 trillion cubic feet, 19.9% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 21.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
Meanwhile, updated weather forecasting models continued to show above-normal temperatures across most parts of the U.S. over the next two weeks.
Natural gas prices are up nearly 40% since late May as expectations have grown that hot summer weather will lead to heavy demand.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.

Elsewhere, crude oil for July delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up 21 cents, or 0.43%, to trade at $49.34 a barrel.
A day earlier, New York-traded oil prices shed 72 cents, or 1.44%, after data showed that oil supplies in the U.S. fell much less than expected last week.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories declined by 0.9 million barrels last week to 530.6 million. Market analysts' expected a crude-stock decline of 1.7 million barrels.
U.S. crude futures are up nearly 85% since falling to 13-year lows at $26.05 on February 11 as a decline in U.S. shale production boosted sentiment. However, with prices now at levels that make drilling economical for some firms, the rig count might start rising soon and the decline in U.S. production may slow.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by nine last week to 337, the third straight weekly rise.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.
Meanwhile, Brent's premium to the WTI crude contract stood at 77 cents a barrel, compared to a gap of 75 cents by close of trade on Wednesday.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for August delivery rose 0.83% to $49.54 a barrel. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Brent crude gained 0.76% to $50.26 a barrel.
Overnight, crude futures fell more than 1% on Wednesday amid a lower than expected U.S. inventory draw last week.
Meanwhile, the spread between the international and U.S. benchmarks of crude stood at $0.77, slightly above Tuesday's level of $0.69 at the close of trading. The front month contract for U.S. crude rolled over to August on Sunday.
On Wednesday morning, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report that crude inventories fell by 0.9 million last week for the week ending on June 17.
At 530.6 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are at historically high levels for this time of year. With the slight decline, the government report defied expectations for a more sizable draw after the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a drawdown of 5.22 million barrels on Tuesday evening. Analysts initially expected an inventory decrease of 1.5 million for the week. Total motor gasoline inventories increased by 0.6 million barrels, while Distillate fuel inventories rose moderately by 0.2 million barrels for the week.
At the Cushing Oil Hub in Oklahoma, weekly stockpiles fell by 917,000 barrels last week, falling below expectations for a draw of 1.5 million barrels. A session earlier, the API reported a decline of 1.311 million barrels at Cushing, the main delivery point for NYMEX oil.
At the same time, data services firm Genscape, Inc. reported a considerable build in inventory levels in the euro zone, pushing stockpiles to their highest level in three years. It comes as storage levels at Cushing, the largest oilfield in the U.S., remain close to full capacity.
For the week, production fell by 39,000 barrels per day to 8.677 million bpd, hovering near lows from September, 2014. As U.S. shale producers have been forced offline due to persistently low prices, weekly output in the U.S. has moved lower in 21 of the last 22 weeks. By comparison, domestic production peaked at 9.604 million bpd this week last year, its highest level in four decades.
In the U.K., markets braced for widespread volatility in the coming days, hours before polls open in Thursday's Brexit referendum. After the close of trading in the euro area on Wednesday, the ""Leave"" campaign surged ahead by a small margin in two closely-watched public opinion polls. A poll from Opinium showed that the Exit vote had taken a slight 45-44% lead, while a TNS survey found that the Leave camp jumped in front by a 43-41% margin, with 16% undecided. Still, British sportsbook  Ladbrokes  (LON:LON:LAD) placed the probability of Remaining at 73% based on its live odds, down slightly from a 76% chance earlier this week.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices rose in Asian trading on Thursday, shrugging off a smaller-than-expected decline in U.S. stockpiles, as the market nervously awaited the result of Britain's ""Brexit"" vote.
Trading has been choppy in the run up to Thursday's vote on whether Britain leaves or stays in the European Union (EU), although markets appear to have largely priced in a ""Remain"" vote.
Brent's August front-month contract (LCOc1) was up 40 cents at $50.28 a barrel at 0217 GMT. It closed down 74 cents, or 1.5 percent, at $49.88 a barrel on Wednesday.
Prices for U.S. oil (CLc1) were also higher, rising 43 cents to $49.56 a barrel. 
Once the Brexit vote is out of the way the oil market is likely to switch its focus to fundamentals, turning its attention to more potential supply disruptions that have sent prices higher this year. 
The worsening crisis in Venezuela, the country with the highest oil reserves, may be the next source of supply concern, said Tony Nunan, oil risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp in Tokyo. 
""There is a cloud hanging over the market from the Brexit vote, which is keeping prices down a bit,"" he said. ""If the vote comes off, we could go up,"" Nunan said, referring to a vote to remain in the EU.
U.S. crude inventories fell less than expected last week, while product inventories were up slightly, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. 
Crude inventories  dropped 917,000 barrels in the week ended June 17, compared with expectations for a decrease of 1.7 million barrels. It was the fifth consecutive week of drawdowns for crude inventories.

Silver futures for July delivery fell 0.39% to $17.245 a troy ounce, while copper futures for July delivery inched up 0.14% to $2.137 a pound.
Overnight, gold fell to fresh two-week lows before paring some of the losses.
On Wednesday, the FTSE 100 gained 57 points or 0.9% to 6,284, closing at a two-week high. With the continued gains, U.K. equities returned to a level from earlier this month before the ""Leave"" campaign in Thursday's highly-anticipated vote began to gain momentum. Analysts at UBS added a twist by offering predictions that the FTSE could plummet by 20% if the U.K. decides to leave the European Union. Billionaire investor George Soros said Tuesday that the British Pound could also fall 20% given such a scenario.
Over the last few months, prominent politicians and economists such as U.K. prime minister David Cameron, Germany chancellor Angela Merkel and International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde have issued stark warnings on the ramifications of a potential Brexit. At the same time, House of Commons Leader Chris Grayling, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale and former London mayor Boris Johnson have shown support for the Leave movement.
In Washington D.C., Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen reiterated her stance that a vote supporting a Brexit could have serious consequences on the global economy and financial markets. In testimony on Capitol Hill, Yellen told the House Financial Services Committee that she has yet to schedule an emergency meeting at week's end in the likelihood that the Remain camp is defeated.
A Leave vote is regarded as bullish for gold, as investors pile into the safe-haven asset due to increased fears that a British departure from the European bloc could trigger a recession throughout the euro zone. Notably, it will take the U.K. a minimum of two years to leave the EU if the Leave campaign prevails.

1515,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2016 07:21PM ET</span>",Southeast Asia steelmakers bid to emerge from China's shadow,"By My Pham and Khettiya Jittapong
HANOI/BANGKOK (Reuters) - As a construction boom spurs steel demand across Southeast Asia, countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand are challenging a flood of imports from China by retooling their steelmaking technology or imposing tariffs.
U.S. and European steelmakers are leading complaints over alleged dumping, but cheap Chinese imports account for two thirds of steel consumed in many Southeast Asian countries. The region includes six of the top 10 buyers of Chinese steel, and capacity utilization in its own mills has slumped to less than 40 percent.
While steel from China is expected to dominate for many years, swelling demand is driving efforts in countries like Vietnam and Indonesia to build more modern plants to better compete with China's vast mills.
""China is a major force with huge supply dominating the world, but we have solutions to deal with it,"" Tran Tuan Duong, general director of Vietnam's biggest steel firm Hoa Phat Group, told Reuters.
Hoa Phat aims to triple production capacity to up to 6 million tonnes over 5-10 years using modern blast furnace technology.
The local unit of Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Group has begun work on a $10.6 billion steel complex in Ha Tinh province with an initial annual crude steel capacity of 7 million tonnes, although this month's planned start-up of the initial phase has been delayed by an environmental dispute. 
TRADE TENSIONS
China has raised global trade tensions as its steel exports have soared, with surplus capacity estimated at more than 300 million tonnes, or triple Japan's annual output.
Steelmakers in Southeast Asia have been hit hard as many of the region's electric arc furnace plants, which use scrap as their raw material, are unable to compete with Chinese blast furnaces using far cheaper iron ore.
Many electric arc furnace plants have been idled and capacity utilization across the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grouping has fallen to less than 40 percent from around 65 percent following a 2010 regional free trade agreement with China that cut tariffs on a raft of goods, including steel, said Roberto Cola, president of the ASEAN Iron and Steel Council.
Hoa Phat's Duong said Vietnam could compete with other Southeast Asian countries.
""But the trade deal is plus C, which means including China, and all troubles come from that,"" he said.
Vietnam was the second-biggest market for Chinese steel in 2015, with imports of 10.11 million tonnes, according to UK consultancy MEPS. Its own steel output that year stood at just 6.1 million tonnes, World Steel Association data showed.
""With Southeast Asia as a whole it's a bit of a chicken and egg situation,"" said MEPS analyst Jeremy Platt. ""The cheap imported steel is benefiting their economic development, but it is hindering the ability to develop their steelmaking sector."" 
TARIFFS RISE
Several countries are introducing tariffs to protect local industry.
Vietnam in March imposed temporary anti-dumping tariffs ranging from 14 percent to 23 percent on steel imports from China and elsewhere. It slapped additional import duties of up to 25 percent on more Chinese steel products that last until October 2019.
Thailand's commerce ministry is working on the final draft of an anti-dumping law and expects to propose the draft for approval by end-2016, a spokeswoman said.
The moves come as local steelmakers hope to cash in on an expected jump in demand.
Indonesia and the Philippines face a huge backlog in infrastructure, said the ASEAN Iron and Steel Council's Cola, with steel consumption in ASEAN forecast to reach 80 million tonnes by 2018 from 70 million tonnes last year.
Indonesia's Krakatau Steel is building a blast furnace with a capacity of 1.2 million tonnes west of Jakarta, which it expects will be completed shortly.
Vietnam's steel consumption surged 34 percent in the first five months of 2016, and demand is expected grow at more than 10 percent a year over the next decade as rapid economic growth fuels infrastructure development, said Hoa Phat's Duong.
Steelmakers' share prices have risen in anticipation. Vietnam's Hoa Phat Group has climbed 35 percent this year, smaller rival Hoa Sen has gained 94 percent, and Krakatau Steel has rallied 123 percent.
In Thailand, steelmakers expect the first annual growth in demand in three years as the government begins work on over $50 billion in infrastructure projects. Shares of Tata Steel (Thailand) Pcl, have surged nearly 40 percent. 
A unit of India's Tata Steel Group and Thailand's largest steel producer, the firm canceled some shipments from Thailand to India in April to supply the metal to the Thai market.
""We have seen signs of improving demand for steel, mainly from the government projects including city rail and road projects,"" said Rajiv Mangal, chief executive of Tata Steel's Thai unit, who sees sales rising 10 percent this year.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded in a tight range between $1,263.50 and $1,273.40 an ounce, before settling at $1,270.25, down 2.25 or 0.18% on the session. It came one day after Gold tumbled more than 1.5% or $20 an ounce, while suffering its worst one-day loss in nearly a month. After hitting 22-month highs last week during a seven-day winning streak, Gold has responded with a current five-day losing skid. Despite the slight declines, the precious metal has still surged more than 19% since the start of the year and is on pace for its strongest first half in more than a decade.
Gold likely gained support at $1,199.00, the low from May 31 and was met with resistance at $1,316.40, the high from June 16.
On Wednesday, the FTSE 100 gained 57 points or 0.9% to 6,284, closing at a two-week high. With the continued gains, U.K. equities returned to a level from earlier this month before the ""Leave"" campaign in Thursday's highly-anticipated vote began to gain momentum. Analysts at UBS added a twist by offering predictions that the FTSE could plummet by 20% if the U.K. decides to leave the European Union. Billionaire investor George Soros said Tuesday that the British Pound could also fall 20% given such a scenario.
Over the last few months, prominent politicians and economists such as U.K. prime minister David Cameron, Germany chancellor Angela Merkel and International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde have issued stark warnings on the ramifications of a potential Brexit. At the same time, House of Commons Leader Chris Grayling, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale and former London mayor Boris Johnson have shown support for the Leave movement.
In Washington D.C., Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen reiterated her stance that a vote supporting a Brexit could have serious consequences on the global economy and financial markets. In testimony on Capitol Hill, Yellen told the House Financial Services Committee that she has yet to schedule an emergency meeting at week's end in the likelihood that the Remain camp is defeated.
A Leave vote is regarded as bullish for gold, as investors pile into the safe-haven asset due to increased fears that a British departure from the European bloc could trigger a recession throughout the euro zone. Notably, it will take the U.K. a minimum of two years to leave the EU if the Leave campaign prevails.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.45% to an intraday low of 93.50, remaining near one-month lows. The index is down by more than 5% since early-December.
Dollar-denominated commodities such as gold become more expensive for foreign purchasers when the dollar appreciates.
Silver for July delivery inched up 0.001 or 0.01% to $17.320 an ounce.
Copper for July delivery gained 0.018 or 0.80% to $2.134 a pound."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Wednesday after a smaller-than-expected weekly U.S. inventory draw erased early gains in crude futures.
Investors also anticipated more market volatility ahead of Thursday's vote on whether Britain should stay in the European Union.
Brent crude was down 55 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $50.07 a barrel by 11:08 a.m. EDT, after climbing to $51.24 at the session high.
U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures fell 50 cents, or about 1 percent, to $49.95, after scaling $51.11 earlier.
U.S. crude stockpiles fell 917,000 barrels during the week ended June 17, the fifth consecutive weekly draw, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. [EIA/S]
But decline was smaller than the 1.7 million-barrel drawdown forecast by analysts and much less than the 5.2 million-barrel drop reported on Tuesday by trade group the American Petroleum Institute (API). [API/S]
""Today's report is decidedly bearish, which has caught markets off guard after yesterday's API expectation of a 5 million-barrel crude draw,"" said Troy Vincent, analyst at New York-based crude cargo tracker ClipperData.
""Although gasoline demand is still strong relative to year-ago levels, a build to both gasoline and distillate inventories does not bode well for product prices either. With this report, we should expect WTI to move back below $49 this week.""
U.S. gasoline demand over past four weeks rose 3.9 percent year-on-year, but stocks of the motor fuel rose 627,000 barrels last week, while distillates grew 151,000 barrels.
Crude prices had moved higher earlier in the session on optimism Britain will elect to ""Remain"" in the EU, and investors braced more market swings as the dollar gyrates on speculation over the referendum. The greenback determines demand for dollar-denominated oil among holders other currencies when other fundamental factors are less compelling.
""Though some may be forgiven for thinking that the outcome is a foregone conclusion, the inconsistency between the betting money and the polls mean that conditions are ripe for a fresh bout of volatility,"" said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM.
Aside from moving on the British vote speculation, the dollar weakened on Wednesday against a basket of currencies after cautious comments on the U.S. economy by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who virtually ruled out a July interest rate hike.

In other industry news, top crude exporter Saudi Arabia said it may reprise its role of balancing supply and demand once the global market for oil recovers.

Crude oil for July delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped 8 cents, or 0.16%, to trade at $49.77 a barrel by 14:35GMT, or 10:35AM ET. Prices were at around $50.20 prior to the release of the inventory data after climbing to a daily peak of $50.54, the most since June 10.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 0.9 million barrels in the week ended June 17. Market analysts' expected a crude-stock decline of 1.7 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply drop of 5.2 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, fell by 1.28 million barrels last week, the EIA said. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 530.6 million barrels as of last week.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 0.6 million barrels, compared to expectations for a drop of 0.4 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles rose by 0.2 million barrels.
U.S. crude futures are up nearly 85% since falling to 13-year lows at $26.05 on February 11 as a decline in U.S. shale production boosted sentiment. However, with prices now at levels that make drilling economical for some firms, the rig count might start rising soon and the decline in U.S. production may slow.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by nine last week to 337, the third straight weekly rise.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for August delivery shed 4 cents, or 0.08%, to trade at $50.58 a barrel after hitting an intraday high of $51.24, a level not seen since June 10.
On Monday, London-traded Brent futures dipped 3 cents, or 0.06%, as investors counted down to the upcoming British vote to decide whether to remain in the European Union.
Politicians on both sides of the debate will be making their last arguments today ahead of polling stations opening Thursday at 6:00GMT, or 7:00AM London time. Polls will close at 21:00GMT, or 10:00PM in London. The result will likely be projected early Friday, before the official vote count is announced, based on preliminary vote counts and exit polling.
Meanwhile, Brent's premium to the WTI crude contract stood at 81 cents a barrel, compared to a gap of 77 cents by close of trade on Tuesday.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration's storage report slated for release on Thursday is expected to show a build in a range between 55 to 66 billion cubic feet for the week ending June 17.
That compared with builds of 69 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 73 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 88 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.041 trillion cubic feet, 20.8% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 23.2% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas for delivery in July on the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped 0.9 cents, or 0.33% to trade at $2.759 per million British thermal units by 13:40GMT, or 9:40AM ET.
A day earlier, gas futures rallied to $2.786, the most since September 15, as forecasts for above-normal temperatures across most parts of the U.S. throughout most of summer raised expectations for power generation demand to meet air conditioning needs.
Natural gas prices are up nearly 40% since late May as expectations have grown that hot summer weather will lead to heavy demand.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning. 
Elsewhere on the Nymex, crude oil for delivery in August inched up 23 cents, or 0.46%, to trade at $50.08 a barrel, while heating oil for July delivery tacked on 0.82% to trade at $1.529 per gallon.

""Despite the surplus in global oil production and lower prices, the focus of attention remains on countries such as Saudi Arabia which, due to its strategic importance, will be expected to balance supply and demand once market conditions recover,"" Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih was quoted as saying by state oil company Saudi Aramco.
""The Kingdom's oil policies are rooted in responsibility, and Saudi Arabia is seeking to maintain that balance while also giving heed to moderate prices for producers and consumers,"" Falih said in the statement on Aramco's website. He made the comments in the United States where he is accompanying Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de-facto leader, effectively abandoned its swing producer role in 2014 when it led OPEC's policy shift by refusing to cut production to support oil prices and allow the market to balance itself without interference.

1526,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2016 02:31AM ET</span>",Gold rush to end whether or not Britain votes to exit EU,"By Clara Denina
LONDON (Reuters) - Gold's sharp gains on uncertainty over Britain's European Union membership are likely to come to an end, regardless of whether Britons vote to leave or remain in Thursday's referendum.
Prices <XAU=> hit their highest since August 2014 last week as the $5-trillion a year gold market rose with other ""safe"" assets, such as German bunds, the Swiss franc and Japan's yen.
Recent polls suggest an even split and although investors are worried about the economic and market fallout of a ""Brexit"", bullion's uncertainty premium is not expected to last.
An ""In"" vote is seen as quickly unwinding gold's five percent gain in June, as appetite for risk rises and focus returns to the U.S. economy, analysts and fund managers say.
""A clear win for the Remain side will see U.S. yields rise as the potential drag on the global economy and risk appetite is removed,"" said ICBC Standard Bank analyst Thomas Kendall.
""Gold in dollars would likely drop four to five percent,"" Kendall added.
The metal is negatively correlated to rising U.S. real yields because the opportunity cost of holding it increases.
And while some see a ""Leave"" result as a risk-off event that could see gold rally, others see lower prices if the dollar rises and oil falls. Gold is often seen as a hedge against rising inflation.
""If investors become overly worried, it is likely that the greenback strengthens with implications for earnings and industry group positioning as precious metals and commodities weaken,"" Citi analyst Tobias Levkovich said.
Another reason for gold to see a sharp, albeit short-lived fall is that in times of financial stress, it can be used as a source of cash to cover losses elsewhere.
Sharp declines in equities, for example, could push investors to liquidate gold positions to free up capital.
Gold fell to a near 14-month low in September 2008, at the height of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and was for a short time positively correlated with riskier assets, as liquidity dried up.
It later increased sharply in value, reacting to central banks' cutting interest rates and devaluing currencies.
While a ""Brexit"" vote might not be as disruptive as the 2008-2009 U.S. subprime crisis, currency swings would impact gold and investor sentiment could be hurt by uncertainty.
Christian Gerlach, portfolio manager at GAM Investment Management, returned to gold at the start of June as ""stress and risk-off forces"" multiplied, but the position is small and would not be increased immediately even in a ""Brexit"" scenario.
""You may have a Brexit, but what kind of Brexit and what kind of conditions,"" Gerlach said.
Investors are also looking at who has been buying.
""Although we like gold, the fact that it has been very aggressively bought for a few months makes us cautious"" said Ashok Shah, investment director at London & Capital, which has $3.5 billion of assets under management.
""If there was going to be a 'Leave' vote, any mini flight to safety would dissipate quickly, because a lot of the money in gold is not long term, but speculative, hedge fund leveraged money.""

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for August delivery rose 0.68% to $50.19 a barrel. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Brent crude gained 0.57% to $50.91 a barrel.
Overnight, U.S. crude futures halted a three-day winning streak on Tuesday, amid a broadly stronger dollar, as Brexit concerns remained in focus.
Investors continued to trade cautiously on Tuesday, less than 48 hours before a controversial Brexit referendum is held in the U.K. Oil prices have spiked roughly 7% since last week's tragic killing of Labour Party parliament member Jo Cox, a staunch supporter of the Remain campaign. Following Cox's death in Leeds on June 16, officials on both sides suspended campaigning for two days, helping the ""Stay,"" camp regain momentum. Currently, there is a 76% chance the Remain vote will prevail, according to British sportsbook  Ladbrokes  (LON:LON:LAD), up slightly by one point from Monday's odds. Last week, the ""Leave"" campaign trailed in median polls by a margin of 60-40.
In recent months, a number of major oil companies have expressed stark concerns on the ramifications that could result due to a U.K. departure from the EU. While potentially creating heightened trade barriers between the U.K. and major partners in the euro zone, a Leave vote could also complicate free travel arrangements with British workers employed by foreign oil companies.
In addition, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen cautioned on Tuesday that a Brexit could create a ""risk-off"" sentiment among traders that has the potential of creating a flight-to-safety in currencies such as the dollar. Such an environment is viewed as bearish for dollar-denominated commodities like crude, which becomes more expensive for foreign purchasers when the dollar appreciates.Elsewhere, traders monitored conflicting reports out of Nigeria on a 30-day ceasefire in the nation's Southern Delta region.
Officials from the Niger Delta Avengers (NDA), a militant group which has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on the oil infrastructure in the region, told Reuters that it has not agreed to a ceasefire with the Nigerian government. Earlier, multiple outlets reported that NDA came to terms on an agreement last week with Nigeria's oil ministry and several state government that would halt the acts of sabotage for at least the next month.
Despite a massive rally over the last five months, crude prices are still down more than 50% from their peak of $115 a barrel.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for August delivery fell 0.14% at $1,270.75 a troy ounce.
Silver futures for July delivery fell 0.25% to $17.275 a troy ounce, while copper futures for July delivery eased 0.61% to $2.112 a pound.
Overnight, gold fell sharply amid a stronger dollar, as Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen reiterated on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank would maintain a cautious approach with future interest rate adjustments, producing little reaction from global equity, currency and bond markets.
In testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Yellen indicated that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remains hesitant to raise interest rates for the foreseeable future amid an uncertain global economic backdrop.
Yellen's appearance marked her first public appearance since the FOMC held its benchmark Federal Funds Rate steady last week at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50%. Citing slow economic and financial developments in China and the euro area, subdued household formation, and meager productivity growth, Yellen said in prepared remarks that the FOMC expects the Fed Funds Rate to remain below its long-term outlook due to the temporary headwinds.
Last month in an appearance at Harvard University, Yellen indicated that the FOMC could raise short-term rates multiple times before the end of the year in the wake of improved labor market conditions and reduced global headwinds. However, the FOMC shifted their expectations and lowered their long-term rate outlook at last week's June monetary policy meeting following a disappointing national employment report in May when the economy added 38,000 nonfarm payrolls, its lowest monthly total in six years.
On Tuesday, Yellen told the Committee that the FOMC will be watching the job market carefully to see whether the recent slowing in employment growth is transitory. At the same time, Yellen said she expects temporary factors holding down inflation to abate. Last month, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 1% on an annual basis, far below the Fed's long-term target of 2%. While Yellen said the FOMC has the legal authority to push interest rates into negative territory, she emphasized that it is not something the Committee is ""actively considering.""
""Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would likely make it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly,"" Yellen said. ""Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the federal funds rate would be appropriate. We are committed to our dual objectives, and we will adjust policy as appropriate to foster financial conditions consistent with their attainment over time.""
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
When asked about Thursday's Brexit referendum, Yellen said a departure by the U.K. from the European Union could create increased volatility on financial markets in the euro area, but added that it's hard to predict the impact on the U.S. Pressed further, Yellen responded that a potential Brexit could result in a ""risk-off"" sentiment that could precipitate a flight-to-safety in capital flows that could push up the dollar or other safe haven currencies. A spike in the dollar, Yellen said, could weigh on domestic manufacturers which are already struggling from a lack of demand abroad.
Dollar-denominated commodities such as gold become more expensive for foreign purchasers when the dollar appreciates.

Last week, the ""Leave"" campaign trailed in median polls by a margin of 60-40.
In recent months, a number of major oil companies have expressed stark concerns on the ramifications that could result due to a U.K. departure from the EU. While potentially creating heightened trade barriers between the U.K. and major partners in the euro zone, a Leave vote could also complicate free travel arrangements with British workers employed by foreign oil companies.
In addition, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen cautioned on Tuesday that a Brexit could create a ""risk-off"" sentiment among traders that has the potential of creating a flight-to-safety in currencies such as the dollar. Such an environment is viewed as bearish for dollar-denominated commodities like crude, which becomes more expensive for foreign purchasers when the dollar appreciates.
Elsewhere, traders monitored conflicting reports out of Nigeria on a 30-day ceasefire in the nation's Southern Delta region. Officials from the Niger Delta Avengers (NDA), a militant group which has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on the oil infrastructure in the region, told Reuters that it has not agreed to a ceasefire with the Nigerian government. Earlier, multiple outlets reported that NDA came to terms on an agreement last week with Nigeria's oil ministry and several state government that would halt the acts of sabotage for at least the next month.
Despite a massive rally over the last five months, crude prices are still down more than 50% from their peak of $115 a barrel.

1530,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2016 03:40PM ET</span>",U.S. says Venezuela guilty of oil sector 'malpractice',"By Hugh Bronstein and Juliana Castilla
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Venezuela has badly mismanaged its vast oil resources, a senior U.S. diplomat told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday in which he said a change in government could quickly turn the OPEC member's fortunes around.
Tensions have been high between Washington and Venezuela, where the president is facing a possible recall referendum amid rioting and looting prompted by food shortages. 
Output from Venezuela, which sits atop the world's biggest oil reserves, was 2.37 million barrels per day (bpd) in May, down 5 percent from April and 11 percent from last year's average, according to OPEC data.
""Venezuela has committed malpractice when it comes to management of their resource,"" U.S. International Energy Envoy Amos Hochstein said. As a consequence, he added, the country is getting below-market prices for lower amounts of crude.
""Venezuela has easy oil to produce,"" Hochstein said. ""So the fact that output is declining shows you how bad the situation is. But it also shows you that if there is a change in government, a change in attitude, it could see an increase in production relatively quickly.""
A top U.S. diplomat will meet with Venezuelan government and opposition officials in Caracas on Tuesday, a week after Secretary of State John Kerry announced he wanted to ease tensions between the two countries. 
A slump in world oil prices has helped devastate President Nicolas Maduro's socialist economic model, leading to snaking grocery lines and empty supermarket shelves. Elected in 2013 after the death of his mentor Hugo Chavez, Maduro says he is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by big business and Washington.
Much of the financing of Venezuela's debt is done in the form of crude for cash. While this allows the government to pay its debt, it takes away precious cash flow, Hochstein said.
""The only place where they are selling their oil at reasonable prices is to the United States, to Citgo Petroleum, which Venezuela owns. So essentially the only place where they are selling oil at market price is to themselves,"" said Hochstein, who spoke with Reuters during a trip to Argentina to visit the country's Vaca Muerta shale formation in Patagonia. 
Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA often blames power outages or equipment malfunctions on saboteurs seeking to subvert the government. The company's president Eulogio Del Pino said this month that Venezuela's output was rising again.

1532,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 21, 2016 01:10PM ET</span>",Gold crashes amid strong dollar as Yellen's remarks fail to move markets,"Investing.com -- Gold fell sharply amid a stronger dollar, as Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen reiterated on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank would maintain a cautious approach with future interest rate adjustments, producing little reaction from global equity, currency and bond markets.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded in a broad range between $1,268.00 and $1,297.00 an ounce before settling at $1,272.05, down $20.05 or 1.55% on the session. With the considerable declines, Gold suffered its fourth straight losing session and it worst one-day loss in nearly a month. At session lows, the front month contract for Gold fell to its lowest level since June 10, erasing nearly all of its gains from a seven-day winning streak earlier this month. The precious metal has still surged more than 19% since the start of the year and is on pace for its strongest first half in more than a decade.
Gold likely gained support at $1,199.00, the low from May 31 and was met with resistance at $1,316.40, the high from June 16.
In testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Yellen indicated that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remains hesitant to raise interest rates for the foreseeable future amid an uncertain global economic backdrop. Yellen's appearance marked her first public appearance since the FOMC held its benchmark Federal Funds Rate steady last week at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50%. Citing slow economic and financial developments in China and the euro area, subdued household formation, and meager productivity growth, Yellen said in prepared remarks that the FOMC expects the Fed Funds Rate to remain below its long-term outlook due to the temporary headwinds.
Last month in an appearance at Harvard University, Yellen indicated that the FOMC could raise short-term rates multiple times before the end of the year in the wake of improved labor market conditions and reduced global headwinds. However, the FOMC shifted their expectations and lowered their long-term rate outlook at last week's June monetary policy meeting following a disappointing national employment report in May when the economy added 38,000 nonfarm payrolls, its lowest monthly total in six years.
On Tuesday, Yellen told the Committee that the FOMC will be watching the job market carefully to see whether the recent slowing in employment growth is transitory. At the same time, Yellen said she expects temporary factors holding down inflation to abate. Last month, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 1% on an annual basis, far below the Fed's long-term target of 2%. While Yellen said the FOMC has the legal authority to push interest rates into negative territory, she emphasized that it is not something the Committee is ""actively considering.""
""Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than the Committee currently anticipates would likely make it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly,"" Yellen said. ""Conversely, if the economy were to disappoint, a lower path of the federal funds rate would be appropriate. We are committed to our dual objectives, and we will adjust policy as appropriate to foster financial conditions consistent with their attainment over time.""
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
When asked about Thursday's Brexit referendum, Yellen said a departure by the U.K. from the European Union could create increased volatility on financial markets in the euro area, but added that it's hard to predict the impact on the U.S. Pressed further, Yellen responded that a potential Brexit could result in a ""risk-off"" sentiment that could precipitate a flight-to-safety in capital flows that could push up the dollar or other safe haven currencies. A spike in the dollar, Yellen said, could weigh on domestic manufacturers which are already struggling from a lack of demand abroad.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, surged more than 0.40% to an intraday high of 94.15, bouncing from one-week lows from Monday's session. The index is still down by more than 5% since early-December.

1533,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 21, 2016 10:35AM ET</span>",Natural gas futures hit a new 9-month high amid rising temperatures,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures rose to a new nine-month high on Tuesday, as forecasts for continued above-normal temperatures across most parts of the U.S. throughout most of summer raised expectations for power generation demand to meet air conditioning needs.
Updated forecasts released Monday said temperatures in the Midwest and eastern seaboard will be warmer than previously expected going into the July 4 holiday weekend.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Natural gas for delivery in July on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to an intraday peak of $2.786 per million British thermal units, the most since September 15. It last stood at $2.756 by 14:35GMT, or 10:35AM ET, up 0.9 cents, or 0.33%.
A day earlier, gas futures surged 12.4 cents, or 4.73%. Natural gas prices are up nearly 40% since late May as expectations have grown that hot summer weather will lead to heavy demand.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early summer cooling demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Meanwhile, traders looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U.S. gas inventories to gauge the strength of demand for the fuel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration's storage report slated for release on Thursday is expected to show a build in a range between 55 to 66 billion cubic feet for the week ending June 17.
That compared with builds of 69 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 73 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 88 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.041 trillion cubic feet, 20.8% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 23.2% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

1542,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 20, 2016 07:24PM ET</span>",Florida resident ordered to pay $2.4 million fine in metals scheme,"Investing.com -- The U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced on Monday that a federal judge has granted a motion for entry of final default judgment order against a Florida resident and three of his companies, requiring him to pay fines totaling $2.4 million for engaging in an off-exchange precious metals scheme.
Under the order, judge Beth Bloom of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida imposed a civil monetary penalty of $1.838 million against Todd Owen Marshall and three of his companies, Harvard Assets, LLC, Harvard International Trading, Inc. and London Assets, Inc. The magistrate also ordered Marshall to pay disgorgement of $612,892, while enforcing permanent registration and trading bans. Last September, the CFTC filed a complaint charging Marshall with engaging in illegal, off-exchange transactions in precious metals on a margin or financed basis. Marshall also completed the transactions, according to the CFTC, without registering with the Commission as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM), a provision of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).
For a 10-month period beginning in July, 2011, Marshall solicited at least 42 retail customers, according to the CFTC, to engage in at least 241 financed precious metal transactions, representing a total value of more than $3.6 million in physical commodities such as gold and silver. As a result of the transactions, Harvard International collected at least $534,226 in commissions from the customers. Furthermore, from a five-month period through April, 2012, Marshall solicited more than a dozen customers in leveraged precious metals transactions, according to the CFTC, representing a total value of $693,000.
Specifically, Marshall failed to deliver the physical commodities through his three companies or through precious metals wholesalers, Hunter Wise Commodities and the Worth Group, two of its primary suppliers. In May, 2014, Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, was ordered to pay $55 million by federal regulators for falsely telling their customers that it sold physical commodities. The Worth Group, owner Andrew Wilshire and his sister Eugenia Mildner were ordered to pay $2.5 million in sanctions by the CFTC in February for taking part in an off-exchange metals scheme.
Harvard Assets and London Assets conducted the transactions through Hunter Wise Commodities, while Harvard International engaged in business with the Worth Group, Law 360 reported. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, off-exchange transactions are illegal unless they result in the actual delivery of metal within 28 days.
The CFTC said in a statement that disgorgement orders may not result in the recovery of money because the defendants may not have sufficient assets or funds to cover the penalties."

At Monday's close, the spread between the international and U.S. benchmarks of crude stood at 0.69. The front month contract for U.S. crude rolled over to August on Sunday.
In Monday's session, crude prices and global equities soared as the ""Remain"" campaign in the U.K. continued to gain momentum ahead of this week's controversial Brexit referendum. It came after officials suspended campaigning for two straight days last week following the tragic murder of Labour Party parliament member Jo Cox. Based on live odds, there is a 76% chance the Remain campaign will prevail, according to British sportsbook  Ladbrokes  (LON:LAD) at odds of 1-4. Alternatively, Ladbrokes said there is a 24% chance voters will choose Leave at odds of 3-1.
A host of major global oil companies have issued ominous warnings of the consequences that could ensue from a U.K. departure from the EU. A ""Leave"" vote could result in the potential loss of free travel arrangements by UK workers employed by euro area oil companies, while leading to heightened trade barriers between the UK and major nations in the EU. Consequently, scores of UK oil workers could require non-EU citizenship to work abroad, a development that could increase operating costs for top energy companies. Among others, Shell (LON:LON:RDSa) CEO Ben Van Bearden has expressed widespread concerns that a departure from the EU could severely restrain company revenues.
Elsewhere, Platt's Oil reported that numerous countries in the Persian Gulf continue to issue debt at unprecedented levels in an effort to ramp up investment projects worldwide. Before the end of the year, Saudi Arabia could issue as much as $15 billion in bonds on international markets, according to Platt's. Over the last two months, Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has also reportedly offered a 5% stake in state-run oil company Aramco, which could raise an additional $100 billion in equity.

Metal traders await a two-day appearance by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on Capitol Hill for further indications on potential delays from the U.S. central bank on the timing of its next interest rate hike. Last Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted unanimously to hold interest rates steady amid slowing labor market conditions over the previous two months. The market responded by downgrading the odds of monetary policy tightening through December.
On Friday, Federal Reserve of St. Louis president James Bullard shifted his hawkish positioning by suggesting that the FOMC may only need to lift short-term rates once over the next two-and-a-half years given the current low interest global backdrop. Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.

1545,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 20, 2016 10:26AM ET</span>",Natural gas futures climb to 9-month highs on warm summer outlook,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures rose to a nine-month high on Monday, on forecasts for continued above-normal temperatures across most parts of the U.S. throughout most of summer.
The National Weather Service’s most recent three-month outlook showed above-average temperatures for nearly the entire country. It predicts far above-average temperatures for the West, the Northeast and the Southeast.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning. 
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early summer cooling demand.
Natural gas for delivery in July on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to an intraday peak of $2.689 per million British thermal units, the most since September 16. It last stood at $2.687 by 14:25GMT, or 10:25AM ET, up 6.4 cents, or 2.44%.
Meanwhile, traders looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U.S. gas inventories to gauge the strength of demand for the fuel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration's storage report slated for release on Thursday is expected to show a build in a range between 55 to 66 billion cubic feet for the week ending June 17.
That compared with builds of 69 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 73 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 88 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.041 trillion cubic feet, 20.8% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 23.2% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
Natural gas prices are up nearly 40% since falling to a 17-year low of $1.611 in early March on expectations of strong summer weather-driven demand for gas-fired electricity generation to meet air-conditioning needs. 
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Elsewhere on the Nymex, crude oil for delivery in August rose 93 cents, or 1.92%, to trade at $49.49 a barrel, while heating oil for July delivery increased 1.83% to trade at $1.508 per gallon.

On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for August delivery jumped to a daily high of $50.40 a barrel, the most since June 13. It last stood at $50.12 by 13:35GMT, or 9:35AM ET, up 95 cents, or 1.93%.
Concerns over a possible Brexit subsided after a series of weekend polls showed the campaign to keep Britain in the EU had regained momentum ahead of Thursday's highly-anticipated referendum.
Last week, momentum appeared to be building for the campaign to leave the bloc, sending risk-sensitive assets sharply lower.
A vote by Britain to leave the European Union may tip Europe back into recession, putting more pressure on the global economy and undermining future oil demand prospects.
A broadly weaker U.S. dollar lent further support to the commodity, as dollar-priced oil futures become cheaper to investors holding other currencies when the greenback declines.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.7% at 93.64, the lowest level since June 9.

Gains were limited on signs of a potential recovery in domestic drilling activity. Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by nine last week to 337, the third straight weekly rise.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.

Yellen is scheduled to testify on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Yellen will appear in front the House Financial Services Committee.
Little news is expected from the Fed chair, after the U.S. central bank released updated forecasts on the economy and interest rates following last week’s policy meeting.
Market players are pricing in a 7% chance for a rate hike in July and 24% for September, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool.
The yellow metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. interest rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rallied on Monday, lifted by a wave of investor confidence and a weaker dollar after polls showed a diminishing chance that Britain may vote to leave the European Union later this week.
August Brent crude futures were up 85 cents at $50.02 a barrel by 5.55 a.m. ET, set for a gain of 6 percent in two trading days. NYMEX crude for July delivery, which expires on Tuesday, was up 80 cents at $48.78 a barrel.
Campaigning for Britain's vote on EU membership resumed on Sunday after a three-day hiatus prompted by the killing of a pro-EU lawmaker. 
Three opinion polls ahead of Thursday's vote showed the 'Remain' camp recovering some momentum, although the overall picture remained one of an evenly split electorate. 
Investment safe havens such as gold, the U.S. dollar, German bonds and the Swiss franc came under pressure, while oil looked set for its largest two-day rise in a month and the likes of copper and equities rallied.
""For oil as a risky asset, what we've seen are intraday gyrations that are coming from the spillover effects of 'risk-on/risk-off' moves that follow the poll numbers,""  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) global head of commodity strategy Harry Tchilinguirian said.
The pound climbed 1.6 percent to $1.4589, extending a recovery from last Thursday's more than two-month trough of $1.4013. [USD/] 
""With Brexit dominating the market headlines, it might be moves in the U.S. dollar that drive the oil market at least until we get that out of the way,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.
""It's likely to be a nervous and skittish week's trading.""
Oil prices continued to recover despite data showing U.S. energy firms adding oil rigs for a third week in a row, suggesting higher production to come.
Oil services firm Baker Hughes reported nine rig additions in the week to June 17. [RIG/U]
Aside from Brexit concerns, the market is likely to be caught in a range as any gains would likely be limited by the return of more shale drillers in the United States, CMC's McCarthy said.

""Capping market gains at the moment is the potential for those very agile U.S. producers to jump back into production should we see any further substantial rises,"" he said.

BP, which declined to give an investment figure for the project, said the field was on track to deliver its first gas in the first half of 2018, set to pump 300 million cubic feet a day of gas to the Egyptian market.
BP decided in November to fast-track the development of Atoll, estimated to contain 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas and 31 million barrels of condensates.
The company is in a tight race with other oil and gas explorers in the region to develop the Mediterranean's huge untapped fossil fuel reserves. 
Italy's  ENI  (MI:ENI) discovered the Mediterranean's largest gas field, Zohr, last year and plans to bring the field on stream by the end of 2017.

1554,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2016 01:43AM ET</span>","With oil price near $50, resilient U.S. shale producers eye new chapter","By Ernest Scheyder and Terry Wade
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Two years into the worst oil price rout in a generation, large and mid-sized U.S. independent producers are surviving and eyeing growth again as oil nears $50 a barrel, confounding OPEC and Saudi Arabia with their resiliency.
That shale giants  Hess Corp  (N:HES),  Apache Corp  (N:APA) and more than 25 other companies have beaten back OPEC's attempt to sideline them would have been unthinkable just months ago, when oil plumbed $26 a barrel and collapses were feared. 
To regain market share, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in late 2014 pumped more oil despite growing global oversupply. It aimed to drive prices lower and force higher-cost producers out of the market, with shale oil seen as especially vulnerable.
The pain was acute. Industry revenue fell more than 30 percent in 2015 from the previous year, the U.S. drilling rig count dropped by more than 70 percent from when oil was still above $100 per barrel, stock valuations plunged and scores of small producers filed for bankruptcy. 
But so far no U.S. producer that pumps more than 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) has gone bankrupt. The survival of these big producers partly explains why overall U.S. production has slipped only about 10 percent since peaking at 9.69 million bpd.
Their agility - which required slashing costs in half while doubling down on improved techniques to squeeze more oil from each new well - is now allowing the industry to cautiously focus on growth again.
But this time, U.S. producers say they will stay focused on capital returns, having abandoned a culture of maximizing production regardless of costs.
OPEC and Saudi Arabia ""thought that there would be major capitulation and damage to U.S. shale producers as a result of the deep downturn,"" said Les Csorba, a leadership consultant at Heidrick & Struggles who works with shale executives. ""But what happened was that it actually created a new paradigm among U.S. producers to transform their businesses."" 
Acquisition activity has picked up markedly in recent weeks, with  Devon Energy  Corp (N:DVN) finding buyers for more than $2 billion in non-core assets. The company is using part of that cash to boost its capital budget by $200 million. 
 WPX Energy Inc  (N:WPX), which spent more on acquisitions last year than any U.S. oil company, sold 45 million new shares earlier this month, planning to use the funds to drill new Texas wells.
""We're a leaner organization than we were before the price crash,"" said Rick Muncrief, WPX's chief executive. 
True, costs were slashed in the height of the price downturn when oil plumbed $26 per barrel in February and ""there's a perception out there that if commodity prices go back up, you're going to lose those cost savings,"" Muncrief said. 
But, he stressed, ""that's simply not the case.""
Industry consensus holds that costs for oilfield services - fracking and the like - may rise in tandem with oil prices, though high-tech advancements in sand, drilling and chemical technologies should stick around. 
""Real progress for us has come on the cost side,"" said John Christmann, Apache's chief executive. ""We plan to maintain a methodical approach to the cycle with a focus on returns.""
U.S. oil prices (CLc1) have recouped nearly half their losses from mid-2014 highs, almost doubling from the 13-year lows hit in February to reach over $51 in early June. 
A year ago prices hit similar levels before plunging; oil executives are hoping past is not prologue.
""People are not necessarily freaking out anymore,"" said Sam Xu, an investment banker with CohnReznick Capital Market Securities LLC. ""Instead of trying to keep their heads above the water, they're now trying to get back in the game."" 
To be sure, some executives say a bit more is needed - at least $60 a barrel - to ramp up drilling and fracking operations across most U.S. shale plays.
That attitude has been reflected in oil producers' capital budgets, which are still billions below 2015 levels.
Hess has long said it will add rigs in North Dakota when oil prices hit that mark, even though it is profitable in the state at $40.
""We need to see a period of stability in prices,"" Greg Hill, chief operating officer at Hess, said. ""We need to make sure it's not quicksand."" 
Some oil companies aren't ready to even acknowledge the $50 milestone as relevant.
""We are head down and working and not ready to take any kind of victory lap,"" said Kristin Thomas, spokeswoman for  Continental Resources Inc  (N:CLR), North Dakota's second-largest oil producer. 
Others are moving ahead in the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian, considered the cheapest and most-prolific U.S. shale oil fields.
""The Permian is set up for fairly explosive growth over the next several years,"" Scott Sheffield, CEO of  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co (N:PXD), said at a S&P Global Platts conference. Pioneer this week said it would increase its rig fleet by 40 percent.
Still, most producers are moving slowly.

""People are going to be waiting to see if this $50 price sticks around,"" said Muncrief, the WPX CEO.

The overall trade balance came in at a drop of ¥41 billion, the first deficit in four months.
Last week, oil futures rose for the first time in seven sessions on Friday, bouncing off four-week lows as a weaker U.S. dollar lent support to the commodity and as concerns over a potential U.K. exit from the European Union temporarily eased following the killing of Jo Cox, a Labour Party member and supporter of EU membership.
Two opinion polls published on Saturday showed that support for the 'Remain' campaign had regained its lead over a vote to leave, while a third showed momentum shifting in favor of a vote to remain in the 28 member bloc for the June 23 vote.
Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by nine last week to 337, the third straight weekly rise.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.

Despite Friday’s gains, London-traded Brent futures lost $1.25, or 2.71% on the week, as global concerns over a potential Brexit weighed on appetite for riskier assets.
A vote by Britain to leave the European Union may tip Europe back into recession, putting more pressure on the global economy and undermining future oil demand prospects.

On Thursday, gold rallied to $1,318.90, the most since August 2014, as worries about a potential exit by the U.K. from the European Union left investors scrambling for safe haven assets.
Voters in the U.K. appear to be evenly split on whether to support a departure by the U.K. from the European Union. While the ""Remain"" campaign held as much as a 70-30 lead several months ago, the ""Leave,"" vote has surged ahead in several prominent polls last week.
For the week, gold futures tacked on $16.30, or 1.5%, the third straight weekly gain, amid waning expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates anytime soon.
The Fed kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday and dialed back forecasts for how fast it will raise rates over the next couple of years, citing concerns over the economic outlook.
While the U.S. central bank retained its forecast for two rates this year, updated projections revealed that six members wanted to see one rate hike this year, compared to just one policymaker in March. Fed forecasts also show at least four fewer hikes than previously projected through 2018.
Market players are pricing in a 7% chance for a rate hike in July and 24% for September, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool.
The yellow metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. interest rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2016 06:43PM ET</span>",Hedge funds' bullish oil bets hit April lows as dollar surges,"By Barani Krishnan
(Reuters) - Hedge funds and other big speculators cut their bullish bets on U.S. crude to the lowest in two months, trade data showed on Friday, as a resurgent dollar challenged oil bulls' attempts to keep the market above $50 a barrel.
Managed money's combined net longs in U.S. crude futures and options in New York and London fell by 46,053 contracts to 198,001 contracts during the week to June 14, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) showed.
It was the second straight week of declines in the net long position of U.S. crude held by such speculators. It was also the smallest bullish position for the group since April 10.
In terms of physical supply, the speculative net long position fell this week by around 46 million barrels, based on 1,000 barrels for each contract.
Before the last two weeks, managed money's net long holdings in U.S. crude rose three weeks in a row, growing by nearly 40,000 contracts, or 40 million barrels.
""This drop shows that at least some hedge funds think oil prices at current levels are suspect,"" said David Thompson, executive vice president at commodities-focused brokerage Powerhouse in Washington.
Oil has had difficulty staying at above $50 since it crossed that psychological barrier in late May.
U.S. crude prices fell in six of the past seven sessions after hitting an 11-month high of $51.67 on June 10.
The slide came as the dollar rallied on concerns that a potential Britain exit, or ""Brexit"", from the European Union would trigger global economic turmoil. A stronger dollar makes oil priced in the greenback costlier for holders of the euro and other currencies.
In Friday's session, however, U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures rose almost 4 percent, recouping virtually all of the previous day's loss to settle at $47.98 a barrel, as the dollar fell on reduced worries over Brexit.
Since hitting 13-year lows of under $30, WTI and futures of global oil benchmark Brent have risen about 80 percent, helped by supply disruptions in Nigeria, Canada, Libya and Venezuela.
Prior to that, worries about a global crude glut drove prices down from a mid-2014 high above $100.
The oil rally has also been challenged by worries that crude output could rise again with oil nearer to $50. Data showed on Friday showed the U.S. oil rig count rose for a third week in a row, indicating higher future production.

1561,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 17, 2016 02:32PM ET</span>","Crude halts 6-day losing streak, shrugging off latest rig count gains","Investing.com -- Crude futures halted a six-day losing streak on Friday, closing near session-highs, after shrugging off reports of a third consecutive weekly gain among U.S. oil rigs. 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for July delivery traded between $45.84 and $48.06 a barrel before closing at $47.98, up $1.77 or 3.83% on the session. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for August delivery wavered between $47.01 and $49.23 a barrel, before settling at $49.19, up $2.00 or 4.24% on the day. Despite the sharp gains, both the international and U.S. benchmarks of crude are each down by approximately 5% from multi-month highs hit last week. 
WTI crude has gained more than 80% in value since slumping to 13-year lows at $26.05 a barrel on February 11. 
On Friday afternoon, oil services firm Baker Hughes said in its weekly rig count report that U.S. oil rigs last week rose by nine to 337 for the week ending on June 10. It marked the third straight of weekly increases, the longest since last August. At the same time, the gas rig count inched up by one last week to 87, boosting the overall count by 10 to 424. The overall rig count is still down by 433 in comparison with the total from the same week last year. 
Any gains in U.S. oil rigs typically provide lagging indications that production nationwide is about to increase. Over the last year, U.S. output has fallen sharply as high-cost shale producers were forced offline due to a prolonged downturn in prices. Last week, production in the U.S. fell by 29,000 barrels per day to 8.716 million barrels per day, remaining down by approximately 1 million bpd from its level 12 months ago. Last June, U.S. crude output eclipsed 9.6 million bpd to hit its highest level in more than 40 years. 
Since reaching a peak of $115 a barrel in June 14, crude prices have tumbled more than 50% amid a glut of oversupply on global energy markets. 
Earlier this week, analysts from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) said they viewed the price recovery in oil ""as fragile,"" reflecting recent production delays in Canada and Nigeria, as well as larger than expected output among top producers in the Persian Gulf. While Goldman noted that not all producers will be able to ramp up production at higher prices, the analysts emphasized that some of the more capitalized ones might have the ability to come back online. 
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.45% to an intraday low of 94.17, its lowest level in a week. The index is down by more than 5% since early-December.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded in a broad range between $1,279.50 and $1,299.15 an ounce before settling at $1,293.45, down $4.95 or 0.39% on the session. It came one session after Gold surged nearly 2% to eclipse $1,310 an ounce, hitting its highest level since August, 2014. With the mild losses, Gold halted a streak of seven-day winning streak. The precious metal has still surged more than 21% since the start of the year and is on pace for its strongest first half in more than a decade.
Gold likely gained support at $1,199.00, the low from May 31 and was met with resistance at $1,337.90, the high from July 11, 2014.
On Friday, a series of events ahead of next week's Brexit referendum were cancelled, as U.K. residents continued to mourn Jo Cox, a Labour Party member who was shot and stabbed to death in North Yorkshire a day earlier. Cox, who was elected to the House of Commons last year, had openly campaigned for the ""Remain"" camp in recent weeks. It marked the first killing of a Parliament member in two decades. Out of respect for Cox, several public opinion polls and a report by the International Monetary Fund were delayed until the weekend.
Voters in the U.K. appear to be evenly split on whether to support a departure by the U.K. from the European Union. While the ""Remain"" campaign held as much as a 70-30 lead several months ago, the ""Leave,"" vote has surged ahead in several prominent polls this week. Still, the British sportsbook Betfair helped assuage concerns of a Brexit by reporting that approximately 65% of the wagers it has handled have come in for the ""Remain,"" side. In recent weeks, British prime minister David Cameron, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde and Bank of England governor Mark Carney have warned of the serious ramifications a Brexit could have on global financial markets. On the other end, House of Commons Leader Chris Grayling, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale and former London mayor Boris Johnson have shown support for the Leave movement.
Meanwhile, investors continued to digest the Fed's decision earlier this week to leave the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged  at a level between 0.25% and 0.50%. At the same time, six members of the FOMC recommended one interest rate hike before the end of this year, up from one in March. Last December, the FOMC forecasted in its quarterly economic projections. that it could raise rates as much as four times in 2016.
St. Louis Fed president James Bullard said Friday that the U.S. central bank may only need to raise rates once over the next two and a half years, amid a historically low interest rate environment among other top central banks worldwide. By comparison, both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan left key interest rates in negative territory earlier this month. Bullard's comments represent a stark departure from his position less than a month ago when he argued at a speech in Singapore that keeping rates too low for an extended period could ""feed into future financial instability.""
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.45% to an intraday low of 94.17, its lowest level in a week. The index is down by more than 5% since early-December.

These two companies, along with peers  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  BP  (LON:BP) Plc, have sold more than a million barrels per day of U.S. refining capacity in the past three years, according to Stratas Advisors, a Houston-based consultancy. 
The world's five largest oil majors together still have enough U.S. capacity to refine about 4.7 million barrels per day. 
Refining profit margins have declined from highs seen in 2015, and the fear is that as crude prices recover from a two-year rout, refiners will be squeezed as the cost of oil rises but the price of gasoline does not keep pace. Selling the plants while margins are still reasonably high allows the majors to exit without a hit to their balance sheets. 
Chevron also told Reuters it has retained Rothschild & Co to market its 75 percent stake in a South Africa refinery. The fifth oil major, Paris-based  Total  SA (PA:TOTF), retained Lazard to sell a 50 percent stake in its sole U.S. refinery, but was unable to secure the price it desired, according to sources. 
Refining has remained a profitable sector during a two-year oil price rout, so these plants can fetch a relatively higher price than exploration and production assets. Chevron and Shell have the highest cash-flow deficits, said Lysle Brinker, director of equity research at IHS Energy, and so have the most motivation to sell.
The two companies have been investing in other areas of their business - Shell plunked down $53 billion to buy BG Group earlier this year, while Chevron has spent heavily on large-scale liquefied natural gas projects.
“They’re much more strapped for cash, and they’re accelerating the sale of assets that will get pretty decent prices,"" said Brinker. ""A lot of the asset sales that the big guys have been selling are downstream and midstream, because those have been sought-after by private equity and others because there’s more steady cash flow.”
These assets may prove to be a better fit for smaller buyers that focus on particular regions, such as the North American West Coast, or companies that concentrate on global storage and trading, but not oil production. 
SMALLER ASSETS ON BLOCK
While the majors plan to continue to operate large, profitable refineries that are well integrated with their oil production assets, refineries outside of that footprint are likely to be sold, Brinker said. 
Chevron's downstream strategy has focused on running large scale refineries that can serve markets in the United States and Asia and on operating petrochemical plants that produce very profitable products. 
The refinery in British Columbia, however, refines light oil, rather than heavy crude from Canada's oil sands, and its products are distributed in a smaller region around British Columbia and down through Washington state. 
Selling smaller assets like that is likely something most companies are looking at - or should be - said Mark Routt, chief economist for the Americas with KBC Advanced Technologies in Houston. 
""Far better to sell it when it's good times than bad times,"" Routt said. ""It's not as good as it was in '15, but it’s still good times.""
Chevron in April agreed to sell its 54,000 barrel-per-day Kapolei, Hawaii, refinery to a group backed by private equity, and Shell agreed in March to exit its Motiva Enterprises joint venture with Saudi Aramco. Shell is shedding a plant in Texas as a result of the dissolution of that venture. 

Chevron previously said it would sell its 75 percent stake in its South African unit, which includes a refinery in Cape Town.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for July delivery traded between $46.16 and $47.75 a barrel before closing at $46.20, down 1.78 or 3.71% on the session. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for August delivery wavered between $47.09 and $48.76 a barrel, before settling at $47.21, down 1.76 or 3.59% on the day. Both the international and U.S. benchmarks are down approximately 10% from multi-month highs earlier this month.
As the dollar soared to two-week highs on Thursday, WTI crude closed lower for the sixth straight session, dropping to its lowest level since mid-May. It came as implied volatility on the British pound hovered near all-time highs, amid escalating fears of a U.K. departure from the European Union at a controversial referendum next week. While leaving its bank rate steady at 0.5% on Thursday morning, the Bank of England also issued stark warnings on the consequences of a Brexit on domestic and global financial markets. But as the pound sterling eased off lows at the close of euro area markets, the dollar pared earlier gains helping trigger a rally in oil prices. Crude futures then retreated again in the final hour of trade, closing near session-lows.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, soared to an intraday-high of 95.53, before falling back to 94.90, up 0.25% on the session. The index is still down by more than 5% since early-December. Dollar-denominated commodities such as crude become more expensive for foreign purchasers when the dollar appreciates.
Energy traders also digested a lower than expected U.S. crude inventory draw last week when U.S. commercial crude oil inventories decreased by 0.9 million barrels for the week ending on June 10. At 531.5 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are at historically high levels for this time of year. While analysts initially expected a draw of 2.3 million barrels, they lowered their expectations following reports of a 1.518 million build by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday evening after the close of trading.
Elsewhere, investors kept a close eye on the escalating crisis in Venezuela, after 400 people were arrested on Wednesday night for looting in Caracas. Scores of residents in Venezuela have been placed under arrest in recent weeks for raiding supermarkets, amid food shortages in necessities such as flour and rice. It came as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry backed international calls for Venezuela president Nicolas Maduro to honor a referendum allowing a recall vote that could force him from power. In May, Venezuela's crude production fell by 120,000 barrels per day, suffering its strongest month-on-month decline in 13 years.
Meanwhile, the NASDAQ Composite index and S&P 500 Composite index were slightly lower on Thursday afternoon, on pace for their sixth straight loss. In addition, yields on the U.S. 10-Year fell as low as 1.518%, their lowest level in four years. The CBOE Vix Volatility Index rose by more than 1 point to an intraday-high of 22.77, its highest level in four months. The Vix is up approximately 45% this week, on pace for its strongest weekly gain since January.
Since falling to 13-year lows at $26.05 a barrel on February 11, WTI crude has rallied by more than 80%. Despite the recent upswing, oil prices are still down more than 50% from their peak of $115 a barrel two years ago.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded in a broad range between $1,294.00 and $1,318.85 an ounce before settling at $1,305.25, up 16.95 or 1.32% on the session. Gold has closed higher in seven straight and nine of the last 10 sessions. Since briefly dipping below the $1,200 level at the end of last month, gold has rallied more than 8%. The precious metal has also surged more than 23% since the start of the year and is on pace for its strongest first half in more than a decade.
Gold likely gained support at $1,199.00, the low from May 31 and was met with resistance at $1,337.90, the high from July 11, 2014.
As investors continued to digest a relatively dovish monetary policy statement from the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and Bank of England followed suit by holding interest rates steady at monthly monetary policy meetings on Thursday. The BOJ, as expected, left its benchmark interest rate unchanged despite a surging yen and sluggish inflation. Following the decision, the yen jumped against the dollar, hitting a fresh 22-month high at 103.58. Yields on the Japan 10-Year also continued its prolonged swoon, touching down to an all-time record-low of Minus-0.21%.
Soon after, the Bank of England (BOE) maintained its bank rate at 0.5% and the level of purchased assets financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at £375 billion. Notably, the BOE issued stark warnings on the ramifications that could ensue from a ""Leave,"" vote in next week's controversial Brexit referendum.
""The outcome of the referendum continues to be the largest immediate risk facing UK financial markets, and possibly also global financial markets,"" the Bank of England said in a statement. ""While consumer spending has been solid, there is growing evidence that uncertainty about the referendum is leading to delays to major economic decisions that are costly to reverse, including commercial and residential real estate transactions, car purchases, and business investment.""
On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a level between 0.25% and 0.50%. It marked the fourth consecutive meeting the FOMC held short-term interest rates steady. The FOMC left its 2016 rate outlook unchanged at 0.9%, while downgrading its forecast for each of the next two years. In addition, six members of the FOMC recommended one interest rate hike before the end of this year, up from one in March. By comparison, the FOMC estimated that it would raise interest rates four times this year in its long-term forecasts last December.
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, soared to an intraday-high of 95.53, before falling back to 94.90, up 0.25% on the session.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slumped 3 percent to hit a one-month low on Thursday, sliding a sixth straight day for the longest bear run since January, as the dollar's rally on fears of Britain's exit from the EU hammered commodities priced in the currency.
Also weighing on the oil complex were uninspiring drawdown data on U.S. crude inventories in spite of peak summer driving demand in the United States. [EIA/S]
Brent crude futures' front-month contact (LCOc1) was down $1.56, or 3 percent, at $47.41 per barrel by 10:58 a.m. EDT (1458 GMT). The session low of $47.20 marked its lowest price since May 12.
Brent has lost about $5 a barrel, or nearly 10 percent, since the six-day slide began on June 9. Prior to that, it hit an eight-month high of nearly $53.
The front-month in U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures (CLc1) fell $1.55, or 3.2 percent, to $46.46 a barrel. It earlier hit a one-month low of $46.16.
The dollar was up 0.7 percent, on track to its largest one-day gain in two months, as equity and other global markets were gripped by fear that Britain will vote in a week to leave the European Union, triggering economic slowdown on the continent and beyond. [MKTS/GLOB]
""It is mainly risk aversion ahead of the Brexit vote next week, so we see some profit-taking on recent long positions ahead of this event,"" said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam.
The dollar was also underpinned by hints from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday that there may be two U.S. rate hikes this year despite slower-than-expected growth. A stronger dollar makes oil and other commodities priced in the greenback less appealing to holders of the euro and other currencies. 
U.S. crude inventory drawdowns over the last month have not provided much support to oil prices.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic crude inventories  fell 933,000 barrels last week, less than half the 2.3-million-barrel decrease forecast.
On Thursday, market intelligence firm Genscape reported a decline of 76,317 barrels in stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for WTI futures during the week to June 14, traders who saw the data said. In the previous week to June 7, Genscape reported a drawdown of 299,058 barrels at Cushing.

""With investor positions already at a record high since the beginning of the year, they might want to reduce some of the risks,"" said Abhishek Deshpande, lead oil analyst at Natixis.

Natural gas for delivery in July on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 2.0 cent, or 0.77%, to trade at $2.575 per million British thermal units by 14:55GMT, or 10:55AM ET. Prices were at around $2.593 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended June 10 rose by 69 billion cubic feet, above forecasts for an increase of 64 billion.
That compared with builds of 65 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 89 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 86 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.041 trillion cubic feet, 20.8% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 23.2% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
Meanwhile, updated weather forecasting models continued to show above-normal temperatures across most parts of the U.S. over the next two weeks.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early summer cooling demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.

Despite recent losses, Nymex oil prices are still up nearly 80% since falling to 13-year lows at $26.05 in early February. However, with prices now at levels that make drilling economical for some firms, the rig count might start rising soon and the decline in U.S. production may slow.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2016 04:20PM ET</span>",North Dakota oil output posts biggest drop in history,"By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - North Dakota's oil output fell the most in history in April, with low crude prices (CLc1) and inclement weather forcing producers to cut back the drilling and fracking of new wells, state regulators said on Wednesday.
The output drop highlighted the deep pain spreading through the second-largest oil producing state, with the more than 50 percent drop in crude prices since late 2014 fueling spending cuts and layoffs. 
The state pumped 1,041,007 barrels of oil per day (bpd) in April, 70,414 bpd less than March, according to the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources (DMR), which reports on a two-month lag.
The drop was the largest monthly decline in the state's history, due largely to low prices but also windy weather throughout much of April, which delays the fracking of wells, said Lynn Helms, head of the DMR.
""You just can't really ignore the significance of that"" production drop, Helms told reporters on a conference call.
The slide is expected to accelerate through May and into the summer, he said. 
Helms had previously forecast the state's output to fall below 1 million bpd by January, but on Wednesday he said that mark could be breached before the end of the year.
""It's going to be very hard for industry at these kind of drilling levels and prices below the $50 mark"" to maintain production, Helms said. The state has begun collecting May production data from companies and will report it next month.
There were 1,590 inactive wells in North Dakota during April, an increase of 67 from March. Producers put wells on inactive status for a number of reasons, though economic stresses often are the primary cause, Helms said.
There were only 28 drilling rigs in the state as of Wednesday. A year ago there were 77.
The drilling rig count rose by 1 from the level during last month's production report, which Helms described as a ""positive.""
Still, there are no drilling rigs operating in Williams County, home to Williston, the de facto capital of the state's oil industry.
While 66 drilling permits were issued in April, an increase from March, that number dropped to 42 in May, the DMR said. 

Natural gas production fell from March's all-time high of 1.7 million cubic feet per day (cf/d) to about 1.6 million cf/d per day in April.

The index is down by more than 5% since early-December.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as investors pile into the greenback in an effort to capitalize on higher yields. Dollar-denominated commodities such as crude become more expensive for foreign purchasers when the dollar appreciates.

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2016 02:20PM ET</span>",OPEC oil export revenue seen down for third straight year: U.S. EIA,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - OPEC's full-year 2016 oil export revenues will probably fall 15 percent, down for the third straight year and possibly the lowest in more than a decade before rising in 2017, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday.
Members of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), including Iran, will likely earn about $341 billion in 2016, about 15 percent below 2015 levels, based on projections of global oil prices and the group's production levels, the U.S. government's EIA said in a report.
The last time OPEC's export revenues fell for three years straight was 1983-86.
At the projected level, OPEC's 2016 export earnings would be the lowest since 2004, when it earned about $295 billion
Early in 2016, oil prices touched 12-year lows before staging a recovery to about $50 a barrel over the last two months. After a long run of oversupply, the oil market is expected to return to balance, driven by output declines, making the forecast for 2017 less bleak.
Supply outages across the world, including Canada and Nigeria, have accelerated crude's price rebound.
For 2017, OPEC revenues are projected to be $427 billion, due to an expected increase in crude oil prices, higher OPEC production and stronger exports, EIA said.
The group earned about $404 billion in net oil export revenues for 2015, down 46 percent, the biggest drop since EIA began tracking the data in 1975.
In 2015, Brent crude (LCOc1) prices plummeted about 35 percent, or $20 a barrel, as major producers grappled with one of the worst gluts in history.
Attempts at a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to shore up crude prices by freezing output fell apart this year when Saudi Arabia demanded that Iran, its main rival for influence in the region, join in.
In 2015, Saudi Arabia earned the largest share, about one third of total OPEC oil revenues or $130 billion.
The 2015 estimates included figures from Iran, unlike previous years, as sanctions against Tehran were lifted, but do not take into account price discounts it may have offered while these sanctions were in place, the EIA said.
Iran has explicitly said it had no plans to freeze the level of its oil production and exports, as the country tries to raise its crude exports to pre-sanctions levels.
EIA's estimates are not adjusted for inflation.

Gold has rebounded by rallying more than $75 an ounce since June 2. Since the start of the year, the precious metal has soared approximately 20% and is on pace for one of its strongest first halves in more than a decade.
Gold likely gained support at $1,125.00, the low from February 3 and was met with resistance at $1,304.40, the high from May 2.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to hold its benchmark Federal Funds Rate steady upon the completion of its June monetary policy meeting. The FOMC has left the target range of the Fed Funds Rate unchanged between a level of 0.25 and 0.50% at each of its first three meetings this year. Last December, the FOMC ended a seven-year zero interest rate policy by approving its first rate hike in nearly a decade.
When the FOMC last met in April, the minutes from the meeting depicted a relatively hawkish committee ready to increase rates further. At an appearance at Harvard University in late-May, Fed chair Janet Yellen signaled that a rate hike could be appropriate in the coming months, as the domestic economy continued to improve and growth continued to pick up. Yellen later backtracked weeks later at a speech in Philadelphia when she removed all timing references to a potential rate hike following the release of weak employment data days earlier. In May, the labor market added 38,000 nonfarm payrolls, its lowest monthly total in six years.
While Yellen expressed concern on the slowing pace of job gains in the labor market, she emphasized the importance of not attaching too much significance to a single report. Yellen noted that the economy added 2.7 million jobs in 2015 or an average of 230,000 a month while the unemployment rate fell to 5%. Yellen also emphasized that while the U.S. economy has outperformed its global counterparts in recent months, significant headwinds from growth concerns in China and a potential U.K. departure from the European Union add uncertainty to the Fed's economic outlook.
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 0.933 million barrels in the week ended June 10. Market analysts expected a crude-stock decline of 2.26 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply increase of 1.518 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, rose by 0.904 million barrels last week, the EIA said. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 531.5 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be “historically high levels for this time of year.”
The report also showed that gasoline inventories decreased by 2.625 million barrels, compared to expectations for a drop of 0.243 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles rose by 0.786 million barrels, compared to forecasts for a decline of 0.249 million.
A day earlier, New York-traded oil prices shed 39 cents, or 0.8%. U.S. crude futures are up nearly 85% since falling to 13-year lows at $26.05 on February 11 as a decline in U.S. shale production boosted sentiment.
However, with prices now at levels that make drilling economical for some firms, the rig count might start rising soon and the decline in U.S. production may slow.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by three last week to 328, the second straight weekly rise.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices on Wednesday were on course for a fifth fall in what would be their longest losing streak since February, knocked by mounting concerns about Britain's possible exit from the European Union and a surprise rise in U.S. inventories.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) fell 70 cents on the day to $49.13 a barrel by 1125 GMT, while U.S. crude prices (CLc1) fell 47 cents to $48.02.
A series of production disruptions in Nigeria, Venezuela, Libya and Canada helped push oil to a 2016 high of $52.86 last week.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute, however, showed U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.2 million barrels in the week to June 10 to 536.7 million, compared with analyst expectations for a decrease of 2.3 million barrels. [API/S] 
But the impending vote on the so-called Brexit is dominating everything from currency markets to German Bunds, yields of which fell below zero for the first time on Tuesday after polls showed the ""Out"" campaign gaining over ""In"". [MKTS/GLOB]
If Britain votes to leave the EU, investors fear the bloc could slip into a recession that could undermine oil demand.
""In a sense, it is putting some market participants on the sidelines and contributing to the cap on crude oil prices,"" Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said.
""Are you going to be buying aggressively ahead of that? Maybe not, because you don't know what is going to happen, but there is no evidence of very strong selling on the back of it either,"" he said.
""For me, crude oil is still stuck between support from the Nigerian disruptions and capped by falling gasoline prices.""
Gasoline refining margins on both sides of the Atlantic have fallen since the start of June, as inventories have grown at a time when demand tends to be at its highest for the year.
""The broad picture at the moment is that oil is being swept up in a broad risk off move associated with Brexit primarily,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.
Britain's Sun newspaper, long critical of alleged European Union excess, also came out in support of Britain leaving the EU this week.
Robust demand and production disruptions have helped balance the oil market but this equilibrium will again tip into surplus early in 2017, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday.

1589,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 15, 2016 03:53AM ET</span>",Oil slides to 3-week lows on bets for U.S. supply gain,"Investing.com - Oil prices added to overnight losses in European trade on Wednesday, sliding to a more than three-week low amid speculation weekly supply data due later in the session will show U.S. crude inventories rose for the first time in four weeks last week.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its weekly report on oil supplies at 14:30GMT, or 10:30AM ET, amid expectations for a drop of 2.3 million barrels.
Gasoline stockpiles are expected to fall by 0.3 million barrels while stocks of distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, are also expected to drop by 0.3 million barrels, according to analysts.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said that U.S. oil inventories rose by 1.518 million barrels in the week ended June 10, disappointing expectations for a decline of 1.4 million barrels.
Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for WTI increased by 664,000 barrels, the API said, while gasoline inventories jumped by 2.254 million barrels and distillate inventories rose by 3.725 million barrels.
Crude oil for July delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell to a session low of $47.55 a barrel, a level not seen since May 23. It last traded at $48.04 by 07:51GMT, or 3:51AM ET, down 45 cents, or 0.93%.
A day earlier, New York-traded oil prices shed 39 cents, or 0.8%. U.S. crude futures are up nearly 85% since falling to 13-year lows at $26.05 on February 11 as a decline in U.S. shale production boosted sentiment.
However, with prices now at levels that make drilling economical for some firms, the rig count might start rising soon and the decline in U.S. production may slow.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by three last week to 328, the second straight weekly rise.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for August delivery declined 47 cents, or 0.94%, to trade at $49.36 a barrel after falling to an intraday low of $48.91, the weakest level since June 2.
On Tuesday, London-traded Brent slumped 52 cents, or 1.03%, as global concerns over a Brexit weighed on appetite for riskier assets.
Recent polls suggested support for the U.K. campaign to leave the European Union is picking up.
A vote by Britain to leave the European Union may tip Europe back into recession, putting more pressure on the global economy and undermining future oil demand prospects.
Brent futures prices are still up by roughly 90% since briefly dropping below $30 a barrel in mid-February as unplanned supply disruptions in Africa eased concerns over a global glut
Meanwhile, Brent's premium to the WTI crude contract stood at $1.32 a barrel, compared to a gap of $1.34 by close of trade on Tuesday.

1590,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 15, 2016 02:49AM ET</span>","Gold holds steady near 6-week highs with Yellen, Brexit in focus","Investing.com - Gold futures were little changed in European trade on Wednesday, after climbing to a six-week high in the prior session, as investors looked ahead to the conclusion of the Fed meeting and the U.K. vote on whether to leave the European Union.
While the Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its policy meeting at 18:00GMT, or 2:00PM ET, Wednesday, the U.S. central bank could provide guidance on its pace of tightening over the next several months.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen is to hold what will be a closely-watched press conference 30 minutes after the release of the Fed's statement, as investors look for any change in tone about the economy or future rate hikes. The central bank will also release its latest forecasts for economic growth and interest rates.
Investors all but ruled out a rate hike in June after U.S. employment data earlier this month showed the economy added just 38,000 jobs last month, the smallest increase since September 2010.
Market players are pricing in a 20% chance for a rate hike in July and 35% for September, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool. December odds were at about 59%.
Besides the Fed, traders will be watching producer price inflation data and the Empire state survey, both due at 12:30GMT, or 8:30AM ET, while industrial production data is due at 13:15GMT, or 9:15AM ET.
Gold for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up 75 cents, or 0.06%, to trade at $1,288.85 a troy ounce by 06:48GMT, or 2:48AM ET.
A day earlier, gold rallied to $1,293.00, the most since May 6, amid mounting concerns the U.K. will vote to leave the European Union in a referendum next week. A series of recent opinion polls showed a big lead for the ""leave"" camp ahead of the country's June 23 referendum.
Prices of the precious metal are up 6% so far in June, as market players pushed back expectations for the next U.S. rate hike and amid worries that Britain might vote to leave the European Union.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures for July delivery tacked on 2.1 cents, or 0.12%, to trade at $17.44 a troy ounce during morning hours in London, while copper futures rose 1.7 cents, or 0.86%, to $2.058 a pound.

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2016 02:10AM ET</span>","At $50/barrel, oil risks 'reverse Goldilocks' syndrome","By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil's battle to reclaim $50 a barrel may have left it in a sticky situation, where the price is too low to lure fresh investor bulls and too high to force more production offline.
Global oil production has fallen by nearly 1 million barrels per day in the last year to just over 95 million bpd, based on International Energy Agency figures. Demand is expected to reach 96.7 million bpd this quarter, up more than 1 million bpd in that time.
An abrupt rise in unplanned production outages, caused by wildfires in Canada, as well as political and economic havoc in Nigeria, Venezuela and Libya fueled a 75 percent rally in the last six months, surpassing $50 for the first time since the height of the U.S. subprime crisis in early 2009.
Emboldened by the prospect of a stubborn overhang of unwanted crude possibly disappearing more quickly than originally thought, investors ploughed back into oil, raising their bullish price bets to all-time highs in April in the case of the Brent market. [O/ICE]
With oil now around the pivotal $50 point, some of this enthusiasm appears to have cooled, while on the supply front, part of that disrupted output is returning.
More worryingly for the bulls, there are signs that U.S. shale production, which is nimbler than conventional output, could be about to pick up again. [RIG/U]
""It's 'reverse Goldilocks' – it's not hot enough and it's not cold enough. If you're bearish, it's not low enough for the bears and it's not high enough for the bulls. Ergo, ($50) is the one number you don't stick at,"" Paul Hornsell, head of commodities research at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN), said.
Weekly U.S. exchange data showed money managers raised their short positions in U.S. crude oil futures and options for the first time in a month last week, and by the largest amount since mid-January.
In fact, it was the break below $50 a barrel in late 2015 that unleashed a dizzying increase in net short positions - over 140 million barrels' worth in just three months, the most aggressive build on record.
LIGHT, SWEET SPOT?
""It leaves the market to think we are in a bit of a 'sweet spot' at the moment,"" Saxo Bank senior manager Ole Hansen said.
""$52 and above is probably not seen as being sustainable at this stage and, at the same time, investors looking for a continued bounce into 2017 will probably look at any weakness as a buying opportunity."" 
The decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in late 2014, led by Saudi Arabia, to let oil fall enough to force higher-cost producers out of business has slashed U.S. shale output by nearly 1 million bpd in a year.
Spending cuts in the oil and gas industry topped $100 billion last year, when the drop in crude prices accelerated the fastest, falling 60 percent to below $50.
Analysts at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch believe that with Saudi Arabia relinquishing its role as the effective ""central bank of oil"", when it would adjust supply from one month to the next to keep the global oil market in balance, the demand side of the equation will prove a key price driver. 
The bank's team notes that demand reacts to oil price changes on average over 12 to 24 months, while supply outside OPEC and North America responds to price changes over a two- to six-year time frame. 

""Global oil supply elasticities kick in over a multi-year window ... suggesting higher prices may be needed to slow down demand in 2017,"" Bank of America-Merrill Lynch's analysts wrote.

Earlier, the Paris-based International Energy Association increased its forecasts for global demand growth in 2016 slightly by 0.1 to 1.3 million barrels per day.
Currently, analysts estimate that global supply is outpacing demand by more than 1 million bpd.
Overnight, crude futures pared sharp losses on Tuesday as rising Brexit fears continued to spook global energy markets.
Energy traders continued to closely monitor poll results in the U.K., which increasingly show a British public shifting their support to the ""Leave,"" campaign, ahead of next week's controversial Brexit referendum. An online poll from TNS said a Leave vote widened its lead over a vote to ""Stay"" by a 47-40 margin, as Rupert Murdoch's Sun newspaper backed a campaign to depart from the European Union. Another survey, a YouGov poll for The Times, found that the ""Leave"" vote held a 46-39% lead, while 11% remained undecided.
Consequently, volatility in the pound sterling hit its highest level in two decades on Tuesday, providing significant downward pressure on oil. A ""Leave"" vote has sparked fears of contagion throughout the euro zone, which could trigger a recession and slow demand for crude throughout the continent.
A number of major oil companies have also issued stark warnings of the ramifications that could ensue from a U.K. departure from the EU. A ""Leave"" vote could result in the potential loss of free travel arrangements by UK workers employed by euro area oil companies, while increasing trade barriers between the UK and major nations in the EU.
As a result, a host of UK oil workers could require non-EU citizenship to work abroad, a development which could increase operating costs for top energy companies. It appears to be one factor on why Shell (LON:LON:RDSa) CEO Ben Van Bearden views a potential Brexit as having a negative impact on his company's bottom line.
Market players also traded cautiously ahead of the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision on Wednesday afternoon. While the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged, Fed chair Janet Yellen could provide key clues on whether the U.S. central bank will raise rates before the end of the fall.
Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as foreign investors pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell 1 percent on Tuesday, down for a fourth straight day, pressured by investor nervousness over Britain's vote next week on whether to leave the European Union, which overshadowed signs of a return to fundamental balance for crude markets. 
Safe-haven German Bund yields (DE10YT=RR) fell below zero for the first time, while industrial commodities and equity markets, seen as more vulnerable to economic risk, dropped after polls showed Britain's ""Leave"" campaign leading ahead of the June 23 vote on EU membership.
The referendum-related concerns eclipsed an upbeat forecast for oil demand growth from the International Energy Agency, which said the oil market is essentially balanced after two years of surpluses. [IEA/M] On Monday, OPEC forecast that the oil market would be more balanced in the second half of 2016 as outages in Nigeria and Canada help to speed erosion of a supply glut.
Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) fell 64 cents to $49.71 a barrel by 11:49 a.m. EDT (1549 GMT), while U.S. crude futures (CLc1) lost 47 cents to $48.41 a barrel.
""Even as both OPEC and the International Energy Agency talk about a tighter oil market, fear of the fallout from a UK exit from the euro zone is throwing global markets into a tizzy,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.
The campaign for Britain to leave the EU has a ""significant lead"" ahead of the referendum, according to a poll from TNS. Some 47 percent of likely voters said they will opt to leave the EU, compared with 40 percent who want to stay, according to the poll of 2,497 people.
""This (the referendum) has rattled a lot of financial and commodity trader/investors with money seemingly starting to flow to the so-called safe-haven U.S. dollar until the dust settles and the voting is concluded,"" said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York. 
""The strong U.S. dollar versus most currency pairs is a negative price directional driver for the oil complex.""
If Britain voted to leave the EU, a prospect dubbed ""Brexit"", investors fear the bloc could slip into recession, which in turn could undermine oil demand.
The dollar (DXY) has risen about 1.5 percent from its June lows against a basket of currencies, spurred by Brexit fears. 
Reflecting this extreme nervousness, volatility in the pound  spiked to its highest level in at least 20 years, rising even beyond the heights seen when U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in late 2008. 
Adding to the uncertainty in the markets was the ongoing two-day U.S. central bank meeting. 

""Not increasing interest rates would be interpreted as the U.S. economy is not healthy enough for increasing interest rates,"" a U.S. trader said.

Natural gas for delivery in July on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 1.0 cent, or 0.39%, to trade at $2.594 per million British thermal units by 14:35GMT, or 10:35AM ET.
A day earlier, natural gas futures rallied to $2.635, the most since September 29, as warmer weather lifted cooling demand prospects for the fuel.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early summer cooling demand.
Meanwhile, traders looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U.S. gas inventories to gauge the strength of demand for the fuel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration's storage report slated for release on Thursday is expected to show a build in a range between 60 to 71 billion cubic feet for the week ending June 10.
That compared with builds of 65 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 89 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 86 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.972 trillion cubic feet as of last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 22.2% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 24.3% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas prices are up nearly 40% since falling to a 17-year low of $1.611 in early March on expectations of strong summer weather-driven demand for gas-fired electricity generation to meet air-conditioning needs.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Elsewhere on the Nymex, crude oil for delivery in July slumped 47 cents, or 0.96%, to trade at $48.39 a barrel, while heating oil for July delivery dropped 1.2% to trade at $1.496 per gallon.

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2016 01:19PM ET</span>","At ground zero of warming, Greenland seeks to unlock frozen assets","By Environment Correspondent Alister Doyle
BUKSEFJORD, Greenland (Reuters) - On top of the world, by a fjord in western Greenland, a remote hydro power plant is buzzing with extra water from the melt of ancient glaciers. This island at ground zero of global warming is seeking to be one of the few places on Earth to benefit.
    Outside the Buksefjord plant, the biggest of five hydro-electricity stations built in Greenland since 1993 in a push to move away from imported oil, cod that usually only thrive further south can be seen swimming in the clear water.
And a worker at the facility is preparing to grow potatoes and turnips on land close to the Arctic Circle that is usually too cold for anything other than lichen and reindeer.
    The north Atlantic island ""is in the midst of new thinking"", Environment Minister Mala Hoy Kuko said, to capitalize on an alarming thaw that included a record early melt on the vast ice sheet in April 2016 before a cooler May.
    Hydro power ""potential will grow even bigger with the warming of the climate"", Kuko said in the capital Nuuk, which gets power from Buksefjord 56 km (35 miles) away. Above his desk is a 2-metre tusk of a narwhal, a whale known as the unicorn of the sea.
Climate change, caused mainly by greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, is set to cause economic harm in almost all parts of the world by spurring ever more droughts, heat waves and floods, according a U.N. panel. 
    Low-lying tropical island states from the Maldives to Tuvalu view Greenland's 3,000-metre (10,000 ft) thick ice sheet with foreboding since it contains enough ice to raise world sea levels by 6 meters if it ever all melted, over many centuries.
    But for the 56,000 inhabitants of Greenland, a giant island a quarter the size of the United States, the melt may be unlocking frozen assets and helping businesses including fishing, farming, mining, shipping and tourism.
    ""Unfortunately I can't sit down and weep and say it (climate change) is bad because overall it's good for Greenland,"" said Henrik Leth, chairman of both Greenland's biggest private company, Polar Seafood, and the Greenland Business Association.
    His firm's pre-tax profit rose to 335 million Danish crowns ($51 million) in 2015 from 235 million in 2014 thanks to high prices for its main products, prawns and Greenland halibut. 
    About 90 percent of the island's exports are fisheries, and many hunters and fishermen welcome shifts in currents, apparently linked to warming, that have brought cod to west Greenland for the first time in two decades, and mackerel to the east. 
HUNTERS
Prime Minister Kim Kielsen, whose island has wide powers of self-rule within the kingdom of Denmark, cautioned that ""there are pros and cons"" to the melt. 
Arctic regions are warming at about twice the global average, partly because a melt of white ice and snow reveals darker ground and water that soaks up ever more heat. 
Most worryingly for Greenlanders, the melt threatens the livelihoods of indigenous hunters in the north who use dogsleds and rely on ice to hunt seals. And some buildings and airports standing on permafrost are at risk.  
Faced with such threats, the islanders are looking to extract as many benefits as possible from the changes.
The ice melt could help the government meet its target of raising the share of its electricity that comes from hydro to 90 percent by 2030, from about two-thirds now. 
Officials say hydro plants that could draw directly from the ice sheet could power a proposed new aluminum smelter and iron ore mines such as for iron ore. 
Buksefjord gets water from a lake, fed mostly by rain and melting snow, with some from ancient glaciers, officials say.
Climate change could also boost the island's hopes to develop minerals ranging from rare earths to oil and gas, even though low prices have put most plans on hold. Melting snow and ice makes prospecting less complicated and improves access to sites.
    ""There will be more open water for shipping and it will be cheaper for companies to get out minerals,"" said Josephine Nymand, a scientist at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources.
    The opening waterways could prove a boon for the tourism industry too, giving visitors better views of spectacular glaciers, such as at Ilulissat. This summer, Crystal Cruises LLC plans to send a first cruise ship through the Northwest Passage from Alaska to New York, calling at Greenland. 
Among other projects linked to the Greenland melt, scientists are also studying how to tap some of a billion tonnes of milky colored sediment that gets washed every year from the ice sheet into the sea.
    ""It could be dredged up and shipped to tropical nations as nutrients"" for farming, said Minik Rosing, a professor of geology at Copenhagen University. 
VIKINGS
Economists say it is hard to pin down the net effects of climate change for Greenland, named by the Vikings about 1,000 years ago during a natural warm period. 
For farmers, for example, warmth and a longer growing season in the south have been offset by drought - some have hauled icebergs from the sea to help irrigation. 
Prime Minister Kielsen, pointing to the ceiling of his office, about 3 metres high, said that in the north: ""Just 15 years ago the sea ice thickness could be compared to the height of this room."" In some places, it was now too thin to walk on, he added.
Showing the importance of ice for transport, Greenland's statistics bureau documents about 15,000 sled dogs on the island against just 4,033 cars, two motorbikes and ""railways: 0 km"".
    The pace of change this year has been disorientating, even though Greenlanders have adapted to sharp shifts in climate since people first arrived from North America 4,500 years ago.
    Many people in Nuuk, a town of 17,000, were shocked when organizers of the Arctic Winter Games in early March, usually a snowy month, had to generate artificial snow. 
Among the drawbacks of warming, rising temperatures are thawing permafrost such as at Kangerlussuaq on the Arctic Circle, the site of the island's main airport. And in 2012, a flood of melt water from the ice sheet washed away a bridge.
    ""It was a disaster,"" said Kim Ernst, a former chef at the Roklubben restaurant that was cut off for three months.
Many glaciers worldwide are shrinking because the summer melt exceeds the amount of snow that falls in winter and gets compressed into ice. In many nations, from the Andes to the Himalayas, this will disrupt hydro power and irrigation.
But despite Greenland losing about a net 300 billion tonnes of ice a year, according to the Danish Meteorological Service, its store is almost inexhaustible.
The CEO of government-owned energy company Nukissiorfiit, Michael Pedersen, said it was looking at building a new hydro project to provide power to the towns of Aasiaat and Qasigiannguit in the west.
But like climate change itself, benefits can be unpredictable. Fishermen seeking the new arrivals, for example, are at the mercy of shifting currents that are often a mystery. 
    ""Three weeks ago I went out fishing and got a lot of cod,"" said Tønnes Berthelsen, deputy head of the KNAPK association of fishermen and hunters. 

    ""Yesterday I went fishing again but I didn't get even one.""

1609,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 13, 2016 01:02PM ET</span>","Gold surges to 1-month high amid mounting Brexit fears, weakness in Asia","Investing.com -- Gold surged to fresh 1-month highs on Monday, as investors continued to pile into safe-haven assets amid mounting Brexit concerns, as well as dismal economic indicators in both China and Japan.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded between $1,275.00 and $1,290.05 an ounce before settling at $1,286.45, up 10.55 or 0.83% on the day. Gold has closed higher in five consecutive sessions and seven of the last nine. At session highs, the precious metal cleared $1,290 for the first time in four weeks. Gold, which has surged approximately 20% in 2016, remains near 15-month highs around $1,300.
Gold likely gained support at $1,125.00, the low from February 3 and was met with resistance at $1,304.40, the high from May 2.
Investors continued to closely monitor Brexit polls in the U.K. after a YouGov poll showed that the ""Leave,"" campaign overtook the ""Stay"" campaign in the latest survey, reversing a narrow lead from a poll last week. It came after another survey taken by research firm ORB found that 55% of British voters support leaving the European Union, while 45% are in favor of staying in the European bloc. A host of major world leaders including U.K. prime minister David Cameron, Germany chancellor Angela Merkel and International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde have issued stark warnings on the ramifications a British departure from the EU could have on the global economy at large.
In China, the Shanghai Composite Index tumbled more than 3% to 2,833.07, amid further signals of weak investment growth in the world's second-largest economy. Last month, fixed asset investment in China grew by 9.6% on an annual basis, sharply below April's gains of 10.5% and consensus forecasts of 10.5%. It also marked the slowest level of growth over a four-month period since 2000. China is the world's largest producer of gold and is the world's second-largest consumer behind India.
Elsewhere, stocks on the Nikkei 225 plunged 3.51% to 16,019.18, after Fitch slashed Japan's credit rating outlook to negative on Monday. Fitch, one of the big three global credit rating agencies, slashed Japan's outlook but affirmed its rating at a current level of A, citing prime minister Shinzo Abe's decision to delay a hike in the nation's consumption tax until 2017. The Nikkei has crashed approximately 15% this year, amid widespread concerns related to stubbornly low inflation, sluggish consumption and soft external trade data. Over the first four months of the year, net selling in Japanese equities amounted to ¥4.5 trillion ($42.07 billion), compared with ¥2.83 trillion in purchases during the same period in 2015, according to Japanese market data.
Commodity traders continue to await a highly-anticipated interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon. While the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not expected to raise short-term interest rates at the meeting, Fed chair Janet Yellen could provide clues on whether the U.S. central bank could lift rates before the end of the fall. The FOMC has left the target range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate steady at a level between 0.25 and 0.50% at each of its first three meetings this year.
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell by more than 0.25% to an intraday low of 94.30. The index is down by more than 5% since early-December. Dollar-denominated commodities such as gold become more expensive for foreign purchasers when the dollar appreciates.

1610,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 13, 2016 10:52AM ET</span>",U.S. natural gas prices jump to fresh 9-month highs on warm weather,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures rose to a nine-month high on Monday, on forecasts for continued above-normal temperatures across most parts of the U.S. over the next two weeks.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning. 
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early summer cooling demand.
Natural gas for delivery in July on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to an intraday peak of $2.635 per million British thermal units, the most since September 29. It last stood at $2.612 by 14:50GMT, or 10:50AM ET, up 5.6 cents, or 2.19%.
Meanwhile, traders looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U.S. gas inventories to gauge the strength of demand for the fuel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration's storage report slated for release on Thursday is expected to show a build in a range between 60 to 71 billion cubic feet for the week ending June 10.
That compared with builds of 65 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 89 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 86 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.972 trillion cubic feet as of last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 22.2% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 24.3% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas prices are up nearly 40% since falling to a 17-year low of $1.611 in early March on expectations of strong summer weather-driven demand for gas-fired electricity generation to meet air-conditioning needs. 
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Elsewhere on the Nymex, crude oil for delivery in July inched up 14 cents, or 0.31%, to trade at $49.22 a barrel, while heating oil for July delivery increased 0.4% to trade at $1.522 per gallon.

Crude oil for July delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange slumped to an intraday low of $48.16 a barrel, the weakest level June 2. It last stood at $48.34 by 13:35GMT, or 9:35AM ET, down 73 cents, or 1.49%.
On Friday, New York-traded oil prices sank $1.49, or 2.95%, after data showed the U.S oil rig count rose the second straight week last week, underlining concerns over growing supplies.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by three last week to 328.
The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.
U.S. crude futures are up nearly 85% since falling to 13-year lows at $26.05 on February 11 as a decline in U.S. shale production boosted sentiment. However, with prices now at levels that make drilling economical for some firms, the rig count might start rising soon and the decline in U.S. production may slow.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for August delivery dipped 78 cents, or 1.54%, to trade at $49.76 a barrel after hitting a daily low of $49.61, a level not seen since June 3.
London-traded Brent slumped $1.41, or 2.71%, on Friday. Brent futures prices are up by roughly 90% since briefly dropping below $30 a barrel in mid-February as unplanned supply disruptions in Africa eased concerns over a global glut
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries kept forecasts for global oil supply and demand unchanged in its monthly market report published Monday.
Global oil demand will increase by 1.2 million barrels a day this year to 94.18 million a day, holding steady from a month earlier.
Non-OPEC production will fall by 740,000 barrels a day from 2015 to 56.4 million barrels a day this year, due to slowing output in Canada and Brazil.
Meanwhile, OPEC’s 13 members pumped 32.36 million barrels a day in May, 100,000 barrels a day lower than a month earlier, mainly due to production outages in Nigeria and Venezuela.
The International Energy Agency will release its monthly outlook report on Tuesday.

Gold is up nearly 6% so far in June, after sliding more than 6% a month earlier, as market players reacted to shifting views on the timing of the next U.S. rate hike.
Prices of the precious metal have risen 20% so far this year amid skepticism over the Federal Reserve's ability to raise interest rates as much as it would like this year.

In the week ahead, investors will be turning their attention to Wednesday’s monetary policy announcement by the Fed for clues on the future direction of U.S. interest rates.
Monetary policy meetings in Japan, Switzerland and the U.K. will also be closely watched.

1622,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2016 02:30AM ET</span>",Coming wave of gas puts focus on finding new shores,"By Ron Bousso and Oleg Vukmanovic 
LONDON (Reuters) - Energy giants such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Total are looking to build terminals and power plants in new markets to soak up the industry's rapidly burgeoning supply.
Companies have invested billions in plants to produce liquefied natural gas (LNG) in places such as Australia and the United States.
But gas demand growth is slowing, prices are down and the LNG volumes companies are set to produce will exceed those even major buyers such as China and Japan can absorb.
That has turned attention to the downstream market and opportunities to create new markets from Ivory Coast to remote Indonesian islands by building gas-fired power plants, pipelines, regasification and storage terminals. 
""We are ready to go downstream as much as it takes to unlock gas demand,"" said Laurent Vivier, president for the gas division at Total. 
""We need to be present in downstream ourselves, to create demand and unlock bottlenecks along the chain including regasification, pipelines and power plants."" 
Total aims to triple the number of its gas and power markets and raise its annual LNG output to 20 million tonnes and its trading to 15 million tonnes by 2020.
The company is taking part in LNG infrastructure tenders, including several gas-fired power plants, in countries including Indonesia, Chile, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Morocco, Vivier said.
Shell believes the number of markets buying LNG could double, according to its chief financial officer, Simon Henry.
""From around 20 to 30 ...we can see potential for around 50 different markets if you look out to 2030,"" Henry said. ""Our aim is to capture the best share of those who are looking now to start or grow."" The focus on downstream mimics a model that companies such as Shell, Total,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) have used for decades in the oil sector where their operations span oil wells, refineries and service stations.
But some analysts question how easily that model can be reproduced.
""Whether they succeed in this is another story, whether they have the mindset for this type of work is also another story,"" said Thierry Bros, senior gas analyst at French bank  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
""It will be a painful test for these companies who are not that experienced in building small downstream demand,"" he said.
TECHNOLOGY 
New technologies are helping speed development, with floating terminals, for example, offering a cheaper alternative to onshore units that cost more than $1 billion.
""We are looking at multiple markets around the world in terms of potential to regas,"" said Shell's Henry. ""Quite a lot of it is floating regasification because it is quick and you can develop (a market) in stages.""
Shell, the world's top LNG trader after buying BG Group, expects to produce around 30 million tonnes of LNG this year and trade nearly 50 million tonnes, accounting for about a sixth of global trading volume.
Global output capacity is expected to rise by half by 2020, potentially adding some 150 million tonnes of LNG to the market.
However, overall gas demand growth is expected to slow to 1.5 percent a year to 2021 from the 2.5 percent rate seen recently, the International Energy Agency has forecast.
In step with oil and gas, LNG prices have also struggled in the last two years. That has prompted traders to offer more single cargoes for immediate delivery on the spot market, making it easier for smaller buyers to find supply.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for July delivery traded between $48.87 and $50.73 a barrel before closing at $49.07, down 1.48 or 2.93% on the session. With the sharp losses, the front month contract for U.S. crude closed below $50 for the first time in four sessions.
On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for August delivery wavered between $50.37 and $52.10 a barrel, before closing at $50.54, down 1.41 or 2.71% on the day. At session-highs, North Sea brent futures eclipsed the $52 level for the first time since early-October. Both the international and U.S. benchmarks of crude hovered near 11-month highs earlier this week, as a longstanding conflict in Nigeria has raged on leading to widespread slowdowns among major producers throughout the Southern delta region of the nation.
U.S. crude futures have surged more than 85% since falling to 13-year lows at $26.05 a barrel on February 11.
WTI crude extended losses on Friday afternoon after oil services firm Baker Hughes said the U.S. oil rig count increased by three for the week ending on June 3 to 328. At the same time, the gas rig count rose last week by 3 to 85 boosting the overall count up six to 414. A week earlier, Baker Hughes reported that its weekly rig count moved higher for the first time since last August, providing drillers with some optimism that a prolonged two-year downturn might be on the verge of subsiding. The rig count is still down by 445 from the same week last year.
It came days after the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that crude production nationwide increased by 10,000 barrels per day to 8.745 million bpd last week, halting a 4-month streak of weekly declines. Over the last year, crude output in the U.S. has plummeted by nearly 1 million bpd. At this time last year, daily production hovered around 9.6 million barrels, its highest level in more than 40 years. High-cost U.S. shale producers are able to return online when the price of oil rises exponentially.
Elsewhere, energy traders continued to closely monitor activities in Southern Nigeria, an area besieged by constant attacks of sabotage on oil facilities in the region over the last month. On Friday morning, the Niger Delta Avengers, a local militant group, claimed responsibility for an attack in the wee hours of a pipeline operated by Italy's ENI (MI:ENI). The attack on the Obi Obi Brass Pipeline, which impacted Agip's major crude oil line, marks the latest attempt by the militants to cut crude production in the area to zero.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose by more than 0.35% to an intraday high of 94.46. The index is still down by more than 5% since early-December.

1624,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 10, 2016 01:06PM ET</span>","Gold hits fresh 3-week high, amid worldwide government bond yield crush","Investing.com -- Gold inched up on Friday completing one of the strongest two-week rallies over the first six months of the year, as investors remained bullish on the precious metal while global bond yields and stocks continued to dip.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded between $1,267.00 and $1,280.85 an ounce before settling at $1,274.05, up 1.35 or 0.11% on the day. Gold has closed higher in three consecutive sessions and five of the last seven. At session highs, the precious metal cleared $1,280 for the first time in three weeks. Gold, which has surged nearly 20% in 2016, remains near 15-month highs at $1,300.
Gold likely gained support at $1,125.00, the low from February 3 and was met with resistance at $1,304.40, the high from May 2.
Investors continued to pile into safe-haven assets such as Gold, as government bond yields worldwide tumbled to fresh record lows. Yields on the Germany 10-Year fell as low as 0.02%, as more than 75% of German government bond yields hovered in negative territory. Throughout the euro zone, bond prices remained high as yields in the U.K, France,Italy and Spain provided unattractive options for investors. It came one day after Janus Capital's Bill Gross cautioned that a $10 trillion pile of negative yielding government bonds could amount to a ""supernova that will explode one day.""
In the last month alone, yields on each of the five aforementioned government bonds have plummeted at least 10 basis points. Since the start of last summer, German bund yields have crashed nearly 100 basis points, while yields on 10-year U.K. Gilts and France Oats have plunged approximately 90 basis points. In Japan, 10-Year government bond yields fell three basis points to Minus-0.17% on Friday. Over the last five months, Japanese 10-year bond yields have slumped more than 20 basis points since the Bank of Japan adopted a controversial negative interest rate policy in January.
Meanwhile, stocks in the euro zone fell sharply on Friday as concerns related to the German yield crush and an upcoming Brexit vote continued to fester. The German Dax plunged 2.52% to 9,834.62, while the broader Euro Stoxx 600 Index fell 2.3% in Friday's session, ending the week down by 2.4%. to 332.92. Earlier this week, the European Central Bank launched a comprehensive corporate bond buying program in its latest effort to bolster persistently sluggish inflation. On Thursday, ECB president Mario Draghi criticized top politicians for placing an undue burden on the central bank by delaying key fiscal reforms.
Across the Atlantic, the dollar extended Thursday's rally following a solid consumer sentiment report by the University of Michigan. In Friday's June flash report, Michigan's Consumer Survey Center said its consumer sentiment index fell by 0.4 to 94.3, remaining near one-year highs. Consumer sentiment has stabilized since May's robust flash report when the index soared nearly eight points, posting its best monthly reading in six years. At a closely-watched speech on Monday, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen credited a significant increase in consumer spending for helping bolster GDP growth expectations over the second quarter.
While the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not expected to raise short-term interest rates when it meets next week, Yellen has yet to rule out a summer interest rate hike. The FOMC has left the target range on its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at its current level between 0.25 and 0.50% at each of its three meetings this year.
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose by more than 0.35% to an intraday high of 94.46. The index is still down by more than 5% since early-December.

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2016 10:02AM ET</span>","Wanted: Oil traders who know China, with good heads for liquor","By Chen Aizhu and Florence Tan
BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese independent oil companies are luring traders, marketers and risk managers away from dominant state behemoths, offering better pay and perks in a hiring spree triggered by the freeing up of China's crude import trade. 
Global oil firms and commodity houses have also been raiding state giants such as Sinochem and CNPC for staff to help handle up to $50 million a day in new crude flowing into China this year, and the cherry-picking of talent is likely just getting started. 
China's independent ""teapot"" refiners, so called due to their small size, could be processing by the end of this year as much as a fifth of the crude imports of the world's No.2 oil consumer. Already, in the first five months of 2016 - the first full year of a dozen of them being granted crude import licences - they have captured about 10 percent of the inbound shipments. 
Shandong Dongming Petrochemical Group, China's largest independent refiner, has built a Singapore-based trading team of 11 to handle this new business, including trading and shipping managers hired from CNPC Fuel Oil Company and the CNOOC group. 
""A team of this size is far from enough for our scale of 10 million tonnes a year (200,000 bpd) crude demand,"" said Zhang Liu Cheng, vice president of Shandong Dongming. 
""We'll need more to cover products, chemicals and market analysis,"" Zhang said. 
Awarding crude import quotas of up to 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to China's teapots has started a tussle for talent as the refiners - and the oil majors and trading houses that aim to supply them - dive into an activity previously restricted to state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
This year, use of the quotas has made up most of a 16 percent or around 1 million bpd rise in China's crude imports, even with several underused and more awaiting approval. 
Those angling for a slice of this market have already hired more than 40 traders and others, mostly from state companies, say colleagues and acquaintances of people who have moved jobs. 
""We have a big but not totally motivated team,"" said a senior trader with a state oil company, noting that offers often beat SOE employment, particularly at smaller firms. 
""Certainly we're going to see more talent outflows as the teapots have just begun hiring,"" the senior trader said. 
Most of the hires are in their mid-thirties, having honed their craft at Chinese state companies such as Sinochem Corp [SASADA.UL], China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) [SASACY.UL] and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) [CNPET.UL], sources said. 
""Our traders are very popular,"" said a source from one of the state oil trading companies. ""Most of those who moved from our company are going to trading houses and majors because the perks are definitely better."" 
(For a table of traders and others hired away from state companies, please see.) 
PEOPLE SKILLS, DRINKING CAPACITY
""We are looking for people who have systematic training, good relationship skills, and people who understand how China markets work,"" said a Beijing-based executive with a global trading house. 
Also, with teapots concentrated mostly in the eastern province of Shandong, an ability on plant visits to withstand drinking bouts could also be critical as official at some refineries there are renowned for their large capacities for alcohol.
""Sometimes I'm scared to visit our refinery in Shandong as they drink too much,"" said a Chinese trader who buys crude on behalf of one of the teapots. 
At Shandong Chambroad Petrochemicals Co, however, teetotallers would have the edge as the company has a strict no-drinking policy that bans alcohol at work and discourages its consumption even at personal events. 
Chambroad, the first Chinese independent to become a Saudi Aramco client, hired a crude trader at its Singapore unit Sunshine Oil last year from a trading outfit for China State Shipbuilding Corp [SASACN.UL].
This year Chambroad set up a Shanghai-based derivatives team of 10 professionals, headed by Harry Cui, a former senior trader and head of futures research for state-owned grain processor and trading firm COFCO Corp [CNCOF.UL}. 
Cui said his team trades Brent futures to hedge Chambroad's four million tonnes of annual crude imports as well as its exports of refined fuel. 
""It's a small pool when you nail it down to trade experience plus market knowledge,"" said the global trading house executive. 
For state enterprises, the loss of roughly 10 percent of the trading teams at some companies is viewed as inevitable. So far the impact has been minimal, but that could change as the newcomers take more of the market. 

Most companies - including  BP  (L:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and  Glencore  (L:GLEN) - declined to comment on their staff movements. New hirees also declined to comment due to the sensitivity of the matter.

1626,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2016 10:02AM ET</span>",Carbon price corridor system could fix Europe ETS: French committee,"By Bate Felix
PARIS (Reuters) - A carbon price corridor mechanism with floor and ceiling prices, and an auction system, could help fix the European Emissions Trading System (ETS), in which prices have tumbled due to a glut of permits, according to a proposal by a French committee.
The mechanism is one of several that is expected to be put forward by the government-appointed committee headed by Engie's Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet, to review European carbon pricing.
France, which currently chairs the United Nations climate negotiations COP21, said in April it would unilaterally set a carbon price floor in the absence of a broader European initiative to strengthen carbon pricing.
World leaders, businesses and international finance institutions have also urged more countries to launch schemes that put a price on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
Mestrallet will present the committee's pre-findings during a high-level forum on carbon pricing in Paris on Friday.
Mestrallet said his committee, appointed by French Environment Minister Segolene Royal in March, had studied carbon price mechanisms in several countries and also held discussions with businesses.
He said the mechanism, inspired by the auction system in North America, involved a carbon price corridor in Europe.
""If the auction price does not reach the minimum defined price, the auction will be canceled and if the price goes above the ceiling price, the certificate will be put in the market and sold at the ceiling price,"" Mestrallet told journalists.
""This solution seems possible because such as mechanism could be put in place through an EU ETS directive to introduce a floor and ceiling price and also a revision of the current auction rules,"" he added.
""Also, from a judicial point of view, this mechanism will not lead to a re-qualification of the ETS system as a tax which would require a unanimous agreement of the EU member states, something that would be difficult,"" he added.
In order to avoid a negative impact on the competitiveness of European industry, Mestrallet said a system that will prevent carbon leakages should also be introduced at the same time.

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2016 02:04AM ET</span>",Oil falls on stronger dollar; high refinery demand lends support,"By Henning Gloystein
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday, as a stronger dollar pulled crude off the 2016 highs hit this week, although strong refinery demand and global supply disruptions lent some support. 
International Brent crude oil futures were trading at $51.59 per barrel at 0537 GMT, down 36 cents from their last settlement. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were down 38 cents at $50.18 a barrel.
Analysts said that a rebound in the dollar had dented oil prices by making fuel imports for countries using other currencies more expensive.
""Oil prices eased back from a near 12-month high as the dollar reversed its recent trend,"" ANZ bank said on Friday.
However, strong overall oil demand especially from refineries, as well as supply disruptions, were helping to keep prices from falling faster and further.
""Despite falling slightly overnight, the outlook for oil (prices) remains positive – which should keep the recent upward trend intact,"" ANZ added.
Crude prices have virtually doubled since touching their lowest in more than a decade in early 2016 as strong demand and supply disruptions erode a glut that pulled down prices by as much as 70 percent from a mid-2014 peak.
Market rebalancing is ongoing. On the demand side, global refining activity is about to hit its highest on record just as crude supply disruptions around the world tighten the market.
Data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that currently available global refining capacity will reach 101.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, its highest on record, and up from around 97.25 million bpd in March.
Of the available capacity, investment bank Jefferies said on Friday that U.S. refinery utilization alone reached 90.9 percent in the first week of June.
Traders said that this means that producers need to pump every barrel of crude they can to meet refinery demand, and that the supply disruptions around the world - from Canadian wildfires, sabotage in Nigeria, and output cuts in the United States, Venezuela and Asia - will tighten the market and eat into inventories.
Yet the strong refinery output could end as fast as it came as the reserve capacity, the difference between available and installed capacity, is about to fall below half a million bpd, the tightest since late 2013, the data shows.

""Refining output, and by extension crude demand, can basically only go down as facilities either go into unplanned outage or refinery runs are cut to reduce an emerging product glut,"" said one trader in Singapore.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The rangebound market for crude oil in May, with prices mostly stuck within a few dollars below $50 a barrel, limited gains for three well-known hedge funds in oil, which nevertheless are up by double-digit percentages for the year to date, returns data and interviews with industry sources showed.
Hedge funds run by renowned oil bull Andy Hall and former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) crude trader Jonathan Goldberg returned to the black after losses in 2015. Ex-Vitol oil trader Pierre Andurand's fund is on track for its fourth straight year of gains, its best since 2014.
But bullish or bearish on oil, the funds could not make outsized profits in May as they did in earlier months of the year.
Brent and U.S. crude mostly traded in a range of $3-$5 below $50 a barrel last month, making it hard for fund managers to make a clear call on direction, sources familiar with the funds' returns said. In early June, oil prices have rallied strongly, with Brent nearing $53 and WTI headed toward $52.
Hall's $2.4 billion Astenbeck Capital Management in Southport, Connecticut gained just 5 percent in May, compared with April's 17 percent, according to an investor letter from the fund seen by Reuters. Year-to-date, the oil bull's fund is up 24 percent, after a 36 percent loss in 2015.
Andurand's London-based Andurand Capital Management, with assets of $1.2 billion, rose about 1 percent last month after a near 7 percent gain in April, a source with knowledge of the returns told Reuters. Andurand Capital declined comment. 
Andurand, who turned bullish on oil in recent months, posted a year-to-date gain of almost 14 percent.
Goldberg's BBL Commodities Value Fund in New York, which manages about $570 million, has gained 21 percent so far for 2016, betting on the relative value of oil versus refined products such as gasoline, diesel and heating oil, an industry source said.
Even so, it only eked out a 2 percent gain for May, smaller than the nearly 5 percent average monthly rise for the previous four months.

A spokesman for BBL declined comment.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2016 02:20PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Isabel dos Santos pledges transparency, efficiency at Angolan state oil giant","By Ed Cropley
LUANDA (Reuters) - Angolan state energy giant Sonangol is spinning off non-core investments in areas such as banking and real estate into a separate fund to allow it to focus exclusively on oil, new CEO Isabel dos Santos said on Thursday.
In her first interview since being appointed last week, the daughter of Angola President Jose Eduardo dos Santos also pledged to bring openness and efficiency to the 40-year-old company that is frequently criticized as opaque and unwieldy.
""We're very committed to transparency. We're very committed to improving our profits at Sonangol and to improving our organization,"" she told Reuters in the staff canteen at the company's swish headquarters in central Luanda.
The 43-year-old, a major investor in various Angolan and Portuguese telecoms, banking, media and energy companies, is ranked as Africa's richest woman by Forbes magazine.
Dos Santos dismissed suggestions that it was her family connections rather than business acumen that led to her appointment last week after the surprise dismissal of the Sonangol board.
Some analysts have seen the move as a sign of President dos Santos -- Angola's ruler for the last 36 years -- putting close family members in charge of key pillars of the economy ahead of 2018, when he has said he intends to step down.
""It's not because of politics,"" the Sonangol chief executive said of her appointment. ""I was brought into this project because of my experience from the private business sector.""
She also confirmed that Sonangol would be split into three units, one overseeing its oil operations, another logistics and the third handling the management of concessions to international energy companies.
Like other energy businesses, Sonangol has been hit hard by the decline in oil prices and Dos Santos emphasized the need to find ways to improve margins by lowering the unit cost of producing a barrel of oil.
In particular, Sonangol officials have spoken of operators in Angola sharing logistics infrastructure to reduce overheads.
Angola is now ahead of Nigeria as Africa's top producer because of militant violence that his hit output in the Niger Delta region.
FIXING THE MENU
Dos Santos said the restructuring would have taken place regardless of the oil price collapse, given the rapid development of Angola's economy since the end in 2002 of a devastating civil war, during which Sonangol was often called upon to provide basic services such as housing and hospitals.
""It is a state company and it was always the provider for many, many things for the country. If we required social housing or if we had issues regarding health, it was always a company that contributed,"" she said.
""But the country has grown. There are a lot more businesses. You have a thriving banking sector, the real estate market is there, you can see all the construction. There are other companies, so Sonangol can push back a little bit from its non-core areas.""
Angola, which relies on oil exports for 95 percent of its foreign exchange, is often cited by anti-bribery campaigners as one of the world's most corrupt countries. President dos Santos has said he has a ""zero tolerance"" approach to graft.
Isabel dos Santos said she intends to change the culture at Sonangol, improving relations with oil majors such as  Chevron  (N:CVX),  Total  (PA:TOTF) and  BP  (L:BP) while breaking down internal barriers with down-to-earth gestures such as using the staff canteen.
""We're a team. It doesn't matter what job you have in a company, whether you're at the top, bottom or in the middle,"" she said in the canteen. 

""I eat here every day. But I didn't like lunch yesterday so I'll have to fix that – that's a quick win.""

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended June 3 rose by 65 billion cubic feet, below forecasts for an increase of 78 billion.
That compared with builds of 82 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 117 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 96 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.972 trillion cubic feet, 22.2% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 24.3% above the five-year average for this time of year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Thursday as traders took profits after three sessions of gains, though prices remained close to their highest this year thanks to a fall in U.S. crude inventories and supply disruptions.
International Brent crude oil futures traded 13 cents a barrel lower at $52.38 a barrel at 0845 GMT, after setting a 2016 high of $52.86 a barrel earlier in the session. U.S. crude fell by 5 cents a barrel to $51.20 after also hitting a new 2016 high at $51.67.
""While we're above $50 a barrel, momentum still remains fairly positive and what we've just seen today is a little bit of profit taking after three consecutive days of gains,"" CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson said.
Oil prices gained ground after data on Wednesday from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed U.S. crude stocks last week fell 3.23 million barrels to 532.5 million, the third consecutive weekly fall. [EIA/S]
""Lower than usual Canadian flows have helped fuel the draw in ... stock,"" consultancy Energy Aspects said.
""We estimate Canadian output losses will total 29 million barrels across May and June, after adjusting for turnaround work that was underway before the wildfires broke out, and assuming a pre wildfire utilisation rate of 85 percent of (the 2015 average),"" it said.
A weaker dollar is also supporting oil prices traders said. The dollar is down about 2.4 percent this month against a basket of currencies, making dollar-traded fuel imports for countries using other currencies cheaper.
But some analysts said there were also signs that the recent oil price rise, in which Brent has rallied 6 percent this month and prices have virtually doubled since February to one-year highs, may be overblown.
ANZ bank said the rises were ""tempered by an increase in (U.S.) crude production of 10,000 barrels per day to 8.75 million barrels per day and the number of active rigs increasing by 9 to 325"".
Traders also warned of an ongoing build up of refined product stocks in the United States and Asia.

With fundamentals both for and against higher prices, many traders and analysts say a price of $50-60 per barrel may be fair value for oil. This is reflected in Brent's forward curve, which stays within that range until early 2021.

It was partially offset by a 1.4 million barrel draw at the Cushing Oil Hub in Oklahoma. Although stockpiles at the main delivery point for NYMEX oil fell to 65.6 million barrels last week, supply levels still remain near full storage capacity.
Analysts expected a draw of 2.8 million barrels, following a decline of 1.36 million a week earlier. On Tuesday evening, the American Petroleum Institute reported a drop of 3.6 million barrels last week.
Meanwhile, crude production nationwide increased by 10,000 barrels per day to 8.745 million bpd, halting a four-month streak of weekly declines. Over the last year, crude output in the U.S. has plummeted by nearly 1 million bpd. Last year at this time, daily production hovered around 9.6 million barrels, its highest level in more than 40 years.
Further gains in oil prices were limited by slowing economic activity in China, as oil imports fell in May to their lowest level in four-months.
Earlier on Wednesday, China's General Administration of Customs reported that monthly crude imports fell to 32.24 million, amid rising congestion at a main port. China is one of the world's top importers of oil from the Middle East.

In China, CPI data for May showed a drop of 0.5% month-on-month, more than the 0.2% fall seen, and 2.0% gain year-on-year, less than the 2.3% increases expected, while producer prices eased 2.8%, less than the 3.3% year-on-year drop expected.
China is the world's top producer of gold and the second largest importer after India.
Overnight, gold rose sharply on Wednesday as the pace of hiring by U.S. employers in April decelerated to a two-year low in April, pushing the dollar down to fresh monthly lows and potentially lower the probability of a summer interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.

The job openings rate rose slightly by 0.1 to 3.9%.
The subdued hiring figures come on the heels of a dismal U.S. monthly employment report last week when the Labor Department reported that the economy added 38,000 in May, the fewest number of monthly jobs in nearly six years.
The downbeat report provided an unexpected shock to the labor market, which added an average of 200,000 jobs per month last year – one of the highest annual totals since the Great Recession. On Monday, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen attempted to soothe markets by downplaying the significance of a single report.
Yellen's comments, however, have done little to convince market players that the Fed could resume tightening in the coming months.

The announcement comes less than six weeks after  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO), Turquoise Hill Resources and the Government of Mongolia approved development of the $5.3 billion underground mine, which was completed on schedule in less than two years in 2013. Since then, more than 440,000 tons of copper have been sold, according to Rio Tinto, with expectations for annual production to average 560,000 tons per year between 2025 and 2030. Jacobs will be responsible for EPCM services to execute the materials handling systems for the new underground mine, associated surface and infrastructure. Jacobs officials expect the project to be completed within a five-to seven-year period.
""We are very proud to be associated with what is a landmark project for Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia and the global mining landscape,"" said Steve Demetriou, CEO Jacobs Engineering. ""The Oyu Tolgoi Underground Project is one of the largest mining projects worldwide. We are excited at the opportunity to contribute significant value to our client and the nation of Mongolia."" 
The Oyu Tolgoi mine in the South Gobi region of Mongolia, is located approximately 550 kilometers south of Ulaanbaatar, the nation's capital. First draw bell production from the underground mine, which has an average grade of 1.66%, is expected in 2020, Jacobs Engineering said. The average grade is approximately three times higher than its counterpart from an open pit. On average, the gold from the underground mine has a grade of 0.35 per ton.

Natural gas for delivery in July on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to a daily peak of $2.501 per million British thermal units, the most since October 15. It last stood at $2.476 by 13:35GMT, or 9:35AM ET, up 0.2 cents, or 0.08%.
A day earlier, natural gas futures tacked on 0.8 cents, or 0.32%, as warmer weather lifted cooling demand prospects for the fuel.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early summer cooling demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Meanwhile, traders looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U.S. gas inventories to gauge the strength of demand for the fuel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration's storage report slated for release on Thursday is expected to show a build of approximately 77 billion cubic feet for the week ending June 3.
That compared with builds of 82 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 117 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 96 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.907 trillion cubic feet as of last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 24.5% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 25.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.

Market players are pricing in just a 2% chance for a rate hike later this month and 23% for July, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool. September odds were at about 46%.
Investors all but ruled out a rate hike at the Fed’s June 14-15 meeting after U.S. employment data last week showed the economy added just 38,000 jobs last month, the smallest increase since September 2010.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said earlier this week that the central bank plans to raise interest rate hikes, but gave no indication on the timing of the rate hikes.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell to 93.52 early Wednesday, the lowest since May 6. It last stood at 93.55, down 0.3% for the day.
Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
Gold for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rallied to an intraday high of $1,259.10 a troy ounce, the most since May 18. It last traded at $1,259.15 by 12:33GMT, or 8:33AM ET, up $12.15, or 0.97%.
Prices of the precious metal are up nearly 4% so far in June, after sliding more than 6% a month earlier, as market players reacted to shifting views on the timing of the next U.S. rate hike.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. interest rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures for July delivery jumped 53.6 cents, or 3.27%, to trade at $16.93 a troy ounce during morning hours in New York, while copper futures inched up 2.0 cents, or 0.98%, to $2.071 a pound.
Monthly trade data released earlier showed that both Chinese exports and imports fell in May, adding to concerns over the health of the world’s second largest economy.
Exports slumped 4.1% from a year earlier, worse than forecasts for a decline of 3.6%, while imports dropped 0.4%, compared to expectations for a fall of 6.0%. That left China with a surplus of $50.0 billion last month, the General Administration of Customs said.
Despite the weak exports, the Chinese central bank said on Wednesday it still expects the economy to grow by 6.8% this year.
China is the world’s largest copper consumer, accounting for nearly 45% of world consumption.

1654,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2016 08:21AM ET</span>",Pharaohs' shadow an omen in Egypt gold search,"By Eric Knecht
EASTERN DESERT, Egypt (Reuters) - Careering around Egypt's rocky Eastern Desert, Alexander Nubia (V:AAN) CEO Mark Campbell peers from his jeep and sees hills so rich with gold they could lure billions in investments and jumpstart the ailing economy. His company just has to find it.
Egypt's gold mining industry has for years been long on potential and short on investment -- the result of a jarring mismatch between spectacular geology and an unattractive commercial framework for mining.
Despite a history of gold mining that stretches back to the pharaohs, the industry is largely dormant. With just a single gold-producing mine, Centamin's (L:CEY) Sukari, the sector contributes a fraction of one percent to gross domestic product (GDP).
But last year, Egypt's government said it wanted mining to contribute upwards of 5 percent to GDP within 10 years. 
This month it will launch its first bid round for new mining concessions since 2009, when a global gold-mining boom brought a handful of first-time investors to Egypt, despite what many of them say were poor commercial terms.
Most of these investors left after the 2011 uprising, driven away by rising political turmoil and falling global gold prices. 
Now, armed with a 2014 mining law that helps streamline investment, Egypt wants to lure them back. 
If successful, the industry could create jobs and attract foreign currency to an economy that is in dire need of both. 
Paul Jones, CEO of Nuinsco, a Canadian explorer that left in 2011, likens Egypt's mineral-rich Nubian shield rock formation that straddles the Red Sea to the Canadian shield of a century ago, before it ""developed the northern part of Quebec and Ontario with tens of millions of ounces of gold, and billions of pounds of copper, zinc, and lead."" 
Leonard Karr, a geologist with Vancouver-based Alexander Nubia, says the ancient continental crust upon which the company's two concessions sit is chock full of potentially recoverable mineral wealth. 
""There are hundreds of good plays,"" he said.
TOUGH TERMS 
That the allure of Egypt's geology has yet to spur a gold rush is down to regulation, investors and analysts say. 
Despite the mineral-rich concessions on offer and the 2014 law, they predict a tepid response to this month's tender. 
Rather than levy a modest royalty on mineral production and collect tax -- a system that helped Peru and Mexico launch their mining sectors -- Egypt offers investors a production-sharing agreement similar to its oil and gas deals. 
Mining companies say the model does not fit their work. Unlike companies drilling wells, their capital costs can stretch for decades as they build out mines requiring hundreds of millions of dollars in investment. 
They say production sharing, on top of a royalty payment, makes Egypt a prohibitively expensive play. 
""Production sharing works for the oil and gas industry, however it does not work anywhere in the world for mining,"" said Centamin chairman Josef El-Raghy. 
""As such, companies will not come and invest in Egypt despite the hugely prospective mineral resource area."" 
For Abdelaal Attia, an adviser to the Egyptian Mineral Resource Authority (EMRA), Egypt's commercial terms reflect the lower risk of exploration in a country where ancient mines populate the desert, indicating known areas of mineralization. 
""You will not go to an area and start from scratch ... you know you have gold there. It's just about how much,"" said Attia. 
""The tax and royalty system can be applied in countries that don't have any information about their lands ... but EMRA has a century of work, reports, and maps.""
EMRA has yet to announce the commercial terms for this month's bid round, but Attia says it will likely stick to the production-sharing model and offer five to seven concessions. 
Yousef Husseini, an analyst with EFG Hermes, said the data available is not enough to lure investors on the current terms. 
""It's clear there is a lot of potential but investors want a more definitive answer. They want to know where minerals are and how much is present,"" he said. 
BACK TO THE FUTURE 
Alexander Nubia, just one of three active explorers in Egypt, is nonetheless bullish. 
Campbell says a prospect his firm began exploring in 2011 will likely yield a commercially viable discovery next year. He plans to begin building Egypt's second mine there by 2019. 
For Alexander Nubia, an exploration junior that takes on a multitude of high risk bets in hopes of occasionally striking it big, Egypt's mining history makes it a sound wager. 
The work of past miners dots the hilly expanse of the company's concession -- a crumbling Roman fort and an abandoned 20th century British mine are not far from its own drill holes. 
Campbell says these relics are cost-saving guides to future discoveries, while new technology allows modern miners to drill deeper and extract lower grade minerals than their predecessors. 

""There's about 6,000 years of mining history here and a large part of it was gold ... It offers almost a roadmap to the opportunities,"" said Campbell.

China's exports fell more than expected in May as global demand remained stubbornly weak, but imports beat forecasts, adding to hopes that the world’s second largest economy may be stabilizing.
Exports declined 4.1% year-on-year, worse than the expected decline of 3.6%, but imports only slipped 0.4%, compared to forecasts for a 6.0% slump.
Meanwhile, investors looked ahead to the weekly data on U.S. crude inventories.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its weekly report on oil supplies at 14:30GMT, or 10:30AM ET, amid expectations for a drop of 2.8 million barrels.
Gasoline stockpiles are expected to fall by 0.7 million barrels while stocks of distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, are also expected to drop by 0.2 million barrels, according to analysts.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said that U.S. oil inventories fell by 3.6 million barrels in the week ended June 3, compared to expectations for a decline of 3.5 million barrels.
Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for WTI dropped by 1.3 million barrels, the API said, while gasoline inventories increased by 760,000 barrels and distillate inventories rose by 270,000 barrels.
Crude oil for July delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange climbed to an intraday high of $51.13 a barrel, rising past the $51-mark for the first time since last July. It last stood at $51.05 by 10:57AM GMT, or 6:57AM ET, up 69 cents, or 1.37%.
A day earlier, New York-traded oil prices rose 67 cents, or 1.35%. U.S. crude futures are up nearly 85% since falling to 13-year lows at $26.05 on February 11 as a decline in U.S. shale production boosted sentiment.
However, with prices now at levels that make drilling economical for some firms, the rig count might start rising soon and the decline in U.S. production may slow.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by nine last week to 325, ending three straight months of weekly declines.

1659,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 08, 2016 02:53AM ET</span>",Gold climbs to 3-week high amid reduced summer Fed rate hike bets,"Investing.com - Gold futures climbed to the highest level in almost three weeks in European trade on Wednesday, as expectations of a summer rate hike faded further, weighing on the U.S. dollar.
Market players are pricing in just a 4% chance for a rate hike later this month and 27% for July, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool. September odds were at about 44%.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said earlier this week that the central bank plans to raise interest rate hikes, but gave no indication on the timing of the rate hikes.
Investors all but ruled out a rate hike at the Fed’s June 14-15 meeting after U.S. employment data last week showed the economy added the smallest amount of jobs since September 2010 last month.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell to 93.67 early Wednesday, the lowest since May 11. It last stood at 93.79, down 0.1% for the day.
Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
Gold for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rallied to a daily peak of $1,253.50 a troy ounce, the most since May 20. It traded at $1,252.85 by 06:53GMT, or 2:53AM ET, up $5.95, or 0.48%.
Prices of the precious metal are up nearly 3% so far in June, after sliding more than 6% a month earlier, as market players reacted to shifting views on the timing of the next U.S. rate hike.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. interest rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures for July delivery tacked on 18.1 cents, or 1.1%, to trade at $16.57 a troy ounce during morning hours in London, while copper futures inched up 0.7 cents, or 0.34%, to $2.058 a pound.
Monthly trade data released earlier showed that both Chinese exports and imports fell in May, adding to concerns over the health of the world’s second largest economy.
Exports slumped 4.1% from a year earlier, worse than forecasts for a decline of 3.6%, while imports dropped 0.4%, compared to expectations for a fall of 6.0%. That left China with a surplus of $50.0 billion last month, the General Administration of Customs said.
Despite the weak exports, the Chinese central bank said on Wednesday it still expects the economy to grow by 6.8% this year.
China is the world’s largest copper consumer, accounting for nearly 45% of world consumption.

Overnight, crude extended its recent hot streak as U.S. futures closed above $50 a barrel for the first time in nearly a year, ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's latest inventory report on Tuesday evening.
Oil prices remained near multi-month highs on Tuesday, as a longstanding conflict in Nigeria continued to slow production helping assuage concerns related to global oversupply.
It came amid growing pessimism from Shell (LON:LON:RDSa) that a damaged export pipeline in Southern Nigeria can be salvaged.
Last week, a facility at Shell's Nigerian oil subsidiary was severely damaged from a series of attacks perpetrated by a rogue military group known as the Niger Delta Avengers, which have purportedly carried out the attacks to further their environmental agenda against a host of energy companies in the area.
""We cannot operate or repair if our people are threatened,"" Shell CFO Simon Henry told Bloomberg at the company's annual capital markets day on Tuesday.

The Avengers, which have reportedly claimed responsibility for more than a dozen attacks in the Nigerian swamps over the last week, pledged on Monday to eliminate all oil production nationwide.
The acts of sabotage have forced approximately 600,000 barrels per day offline, pushing Nigerian output to its lowest levels in more than two decades. Separately, Kachikwu said that daily production in the country has fallen to a range in between 1.5 and 1.6 million barrels per day, down from 2.2 million bpd at the start of the year.

1661,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2016 08:21PM ET</span>",ConocoPhillips has 10 percent of Surmont wells running after wildfire,"By Eric M. Johnson and Nia Williams
CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (N:COP) has 10 percent of wells activated at its 60,000 barrels per day Surmont oil sands project, which had been shut down as a precaution due to a massive wildfire in northern Alberta, a company executive said on Tuesday.
Conoco, the largest U.S. independent oil company, restarted production last week after a 29-day shutdown at its thermal project some 63 kilometers (35 miles) southeast of the fire-stricken town of Fort McMurray. First production started flowing on Friday.
The blaze shuttered more than a million barrels per day of crude production in the oil sands region, the world's third-largest crude reserve, though most producers are now in the process of ramping up.
""We have about 10 percent of the wells done so we have another 90 percent to get going,"" Perry Berkenpas, Senior Vice President Oil Sands, said in an interview at the company's offices in Calgary. 
""What we've been able to do is keep within safe operating windows and still ramp-up the production more aggressively than we originally planned,"" he said.
While he declined to provide a specific timeline for when the site would reach full pre-fire production levels, Berkenpas said it would ""probably not"" be by early July.
Even so, Berkenpas said the company is ""absolutely on track"" to reach a capacity of 150,000 bpd gross by the end of 2017. The joint venture between Conoco and Total E&P Canada was producing roughly 60,000 bpd before the fire, or 30,000 bpd net for Conoco alone.
Earlier on Tuesday the company said there was very minor damage at Surmont and the majority of its nearly 700 employees were expected on-site by the end of this week. It said it found ""very minor damage"" with no impact to on-going operations.
Thermal operations means that steam is injected into the oil sands reservoir, slowly liquefying the tarry bitumen deposits so they can flow to the surface. In general, the length of time operations are halted and the maturity of the reservoir are crucial for determining how difficult and costly a restart process is.
Berkenpas said generally they are finding that the pressures and temperatures either match what they thought they would be, or in some cases were better.

""During the startup we found that we have a couple of different wellbore designs (the wells and internal equipment) and some of those designs seem more robust than others and allow us to do the startup and ramp-up a little bit faster than some of the previous designs,"" he said.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery eased 0.04% to $1,246.55 a troy ounce.
Silver futures for July delivery fell 0.02% to $16.390 a troy ounce, while copper futures for July delivery rose 0.10% to $2.054 a pound.
Overnight, gold eased from two-week highs on Tuesday in spite of a stronger dollar, as investors continued to react to abstruse comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on the strength of the global economy and the possibility of a summer interest rate hike.
Addressing a luncheon audience at a World Affairs Council event in Philadelphia on Monday, Yellen omitted any reference to the timing of the Fed's next interest rate hike. Yellen's stance represented a shift from her position less than two weeks ago when she sent strong indications that the Fed appeared ready to resume tightening of its monetary policy cycle.
But last week the domestic labor market suffered an unforeseen shock when the U.S. Department of Labor reported that the economy added 38,000 in May, the fewest number of monthly jobs in nearly six years.
While maintaining her signature calm disposition, Yellen downplayed the unsettling developments arguing that it is not constructive to attach too much significance to one report. Yellen also emphasized that a potential ""leave"" vote by U.K. voters in a controversial June 23 referendum could pose serious repercussions to the world economy.
Yellen's comments have done little to sway market sentiments. The CME Group's (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool lowered the probability of a July rate hike to 24.8% on Tuesday from 25.8% one session earlier. The market sees virtually no chance of a rate hike next week when the FOMC convenes for the two-day meeting on June 14-15. The current probability of a June rate hike fell to 1.9% on Tuesday from 3.8% during the previous day.
Investors who are bullish on gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed over the current cycle. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.

U.S. crude stockpiles likely fell by 2.7 million barrels last week to mark a third straight week of declines, an updated Reuters poll showed. [EIA/S]
A report by trade group American Petroleum Institute (API), released after prices settled, showed a higher-than-expected crude draw of 3.6 million barrels.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will issue official inventory numbers on Wednesday. 
Crude oil rallied in the past two sessions after rebels in Nigeria's Niger Delta vowed to halt output in the country, Africa's biggest producer until last year. The Nigerian government said it was initiating talks with the rebels.
""The market remains concerned about unscheduled supply interruptions with the latest coming from additional shut-ins in Nigeria,"" said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York.
""With the industry projecting a decline in total U.S. crude oil stocks in this week's reports, the market bears are remaining on the sidelines.""
U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures (CLc1) settled up 67 cents, or 1.4 percent, at $50.36 a barrel. It was WTI's first settlement above $50 since July 2015. The session high was $50.53, a peak from October. 
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) settled up 89 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $51.44 a barrel. In post-settlement trade, Brent reached $51.54, a peak since October.
Both Brent and WTI have almost doubled in value since winter, when they hit their lowest since 2003.
Prices bounced off those lows on talk of an OPEC production freeze, which did not materialize. The rally heightened after last month's wildfires in Canada's oil sands region and also has been supported by supply outages elsewhere, including Nigeria, Venezuela and Libya.
In its latest short-term energy outlook issued on Tuesday, the EIA said it expects U.S. crude production declines for 2016 and 2017 to remain unchanged from a month ago.
Production will fall by 830,000 bpd this year to 8.6 million bpd, and drop next year by 410,000 bpd to 8.19 million bpd, the agency said.

TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - The storm Colin dissipated off coastal North Carolina on Tuesday and moved out to sea after pounding the U.S. Southeast with torrential rains and winds, but flooding remained a concern in parts of Florida that received the brunt of the tropical storm.
Colin was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone southwest of coastal North Carolina. As it moved off to sea in the afternoon, it packed winds up to 60 miles per hour (95 kph), National Hurricane Center in Miami said.
The storm was downgraded just hours after making landfall on Florida's northern Gulf Coast early Tuesday. It then swept across Georgia on its path to the Atlantic, affecting coastal South and North Carolina.
Although tropical storm warnings had been discontinued, flood watches remained in effect for 24 of Florida's 67 counties, the governor's office said in a statement.
The storm dumped as much as 10 inches of rain on Florida communities around Tampa, Tallahassee and Gainesville, according to the National Weather Service.
With one to five inches of additional rain expected to douse central Florida into Tuesday evening, some Tampa Bay area municipalities continued to supply sandbags to residents.
Near Clearwater, Florida, authorities used boats and emergency equipment to evacuate 30 people from a mobile-home park inundated by flooding. No one was injured, according to the Largo Police Department, which was involved in the efforts.
As much as two feet of water entered some homes, said Tracy Rascher, property manager at the Mariners Cove Mobile Home Park. 
""They aren’t doing very well,"" she said. ""They don’t have a place to go back to tonight.""
Before the storm hit, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in 34 counties. He also activated the Florida National Guard, which remained on alert on Tuesday. 
Colin also threatened crops in Florida, the country's biggest citrus producer, and sent U.S. orange juice futures on Monday to their highest in more than two years. 

The storm is part of a brisk start to the Atlantic hurricane season that runs through Nov. 30. Over the U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend, the Carolinas were lashed by heavy rain and winds from Tropical Storm Bonnie.

""We cannot operate or repair if our people are threatened,"" Shell CFO Simon Henry told Bloomberg at the company's annual capital markets day on Tuesday.
On Monday evening, Nigeria oil minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu announced that president Muhammadu Buhari's national security team had initiated discussions with the militant group in an effort to slow the rate of attacks. The Avengers, which have reportedly claimed responsibility for more than a dozen attacks in the Nigerian swamps over the last week, pledged on Monday to eliminate all oil production nationwide. The acts of sabotage have forced approximately 600,000 barrels per day offline, pushing Nigerian output to its lowest levels in more than two decades. Separately, Kachikwu said that daily production in the country has fallen to a range in between 1.5 and 1.6 million barrels per day, down from 2.2 million bpd at the start of the year.
At the close of trading on Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute is expected to report a draw of 3.5 million barrels in U.S. crude inventories for the week ending on June 3. Although U.S. crude stockpiles have fallen in each of the last two weeks, they still remain close to full storage capacity.
Any considerable inventory draws are viewed as bullish for crude prices, as global demand outpaces supply by approximately 1.4 million bpd.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell more than 0.15% to an intraday low of 93.75. The index has crashed by more than 5% since early-December.

1668,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 07, 2016 01:02PM ET</span>","Gold eases from 2-week highs, amid continued rate hike uncertainty","Investing.com -- Gold eased from two-week highs on Tuesday in spite of a stronger dollar, as investors continued to react to abstruse comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on the strength of the global economy and the possibility of a summer interest rate hike.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded between $1,237.00 and $1,249.05 an ounce before settling at $1,245.35, down $2.05 or 0.16%. Gold has rallied somewhat from a prolonged slump late last month when the yellow metal briefly dipped below $1,200 to fall to a three-month trough. Since the start of the year, gold futures are still up by approximately 15% holding onto gains from the strongest first quarter of a year in more than a decade.
Gold likely gained support at $1,125.00, the low from February 3 and was met with resistance at $1,304.40, the high from May 2.
Gold closed relatively flat in Tuesday's session as equities worldwide surged in response to Yellen's final public comments before next week's critical Fed meeting. Addressing a luncheon audience at a World Affairs Council event in Philadelphia on Monday, Yellen omitted any reference to the timing of the Fed's next interest rate hike. Yellen's stance represented a shift from her position less than two weeks ago when she sent strong indications that the Fed appeared ready to resume tightening of its monetary policy cycle.
Following last December's historic interest rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed has left its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a targeted range between 0.25 and 0.50% at each of its three meetings this year. Yellen's comments in late-May appeared to suggest that the FOMC could be ready to raise short-term interest rates on multiple occasions before the end of the year, as the labor market and inflation showed signs of firming. At its FOMC meeting in March, the committee's median projections forecasted the potential for two rate increases of 25 basis points each in 2016.
But last week the domestic labor market suffered an unforeseen shock when the U.S. Department of Labor reported that the economy added 38,000 in May, the fewest number of monthly jobs in nearly six years. While maintaining her signature calm disposition, Yellen downplayed the unsettling developments arguing that it is not constructive to attach too much significance to one report. Yellen also emphasized that a potential ""leave"" vote by U.K. voters in a controversial June 23 referendum could pose serious repercussions to the world economy.
Yellen's comments have done little to sway market sentiments. The CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool lowered the probability of a July rate hike to 24.8% on Tuesday from 25.8% one session earlier. The market sees virtually no chance of a rate hike next week when the FOMC convenes for the two-day meeting on June 14-15. The current probability of a June rate hike fell to 1.9% on Tuesday from 3.8% during the previous day.
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed over the current cycle. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.

Natural gas for delivery in July on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 1.5 cents, or 0.61%, to trade at $2.451 per million British thermal units by 14:38GMT, or 10:38AM ET.
A day earlier, natural gas futures rallied to $2.480, the most since January 11, as warmer weather lifted cooling demand prospects for the fuel.
Strong upper level high pressure will dominate much of the U.S. through June 21, with temperatures reaching the upper 80s to 100 Fahrenheit.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early summer cooling demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Meanwhile, traders looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U.S. gas inventories to gauge the strength of demand for the fuel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration's storage report slated for release on Thursday is expected to show a build of approximately 77 billion cubic feet for the week ending June 3.
That compared with builds of 82 billion cubic feet in the prior week, 117 billion a year earlier and a five-year average of 96 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.907 trillion cubic feet as of last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 24.5% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 25.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
Elsewhere on the Nymex, crude oil for delivery in July tacked on 39 cents, or 0.78%, to trade at $50.08 a barrel, while heating oil for July delivery increased 1.6% to trade at $1.527 per gallon.

Global equities rose sharply on Tuesday after dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen cooled near-term U.S. rate hike bets and as oil prices firmed above the $50-level.
Gold for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell to an intraday low of $1,236.90 a troy ounce. It last stood at $1,242.60 by 13:31GMT, or 9:31AM ET, down $4.80, or 0.38%.

Speaking at an event in Philadelphia on Monday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen gave a largely upbeat assessment of the U.S. economic outlook, but declined to set a specific timetable for the U.S. central bank's next interest rate hike.
Yellen’s comments all but ruled out a chance for a June rate hike, with traders pricing in just a 2% probability based on Fed funds futures. Odds for a July rate hike dropped to 25% from 33% before Yellen spoke. Those odds were at nearly 60% before the disappointing May jobs report late last week.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.15% at 93.89, close to the previous session’s three-week lows of 93.74
Gold has been under pressure in recent weeks, falling to a low of $1,199.00 on May 31 as hawkish comments from Fed officials as well as minutes of the Fed's April meeting convinced many analysts and investors that a rate hike in June or July is a real possibility. Gold futures are still up nearly 15% so far this year.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. interest rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures for July delivery shed 7.2 cents, or 0.44%, to trade at $16.37 a troy ounce during morning hours in New York, while copper futures tumbled 6.0 cents, or 2.86%, to $2.057 a pound.

1672,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2016 08:20AM ET</span>",Nigeria to talk with Delta Avengers: oil minister,"By Felix Onuah
ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria will talk with the Niger Delta Avengers militant group which has claimed a string of attacks that cut crude output sharply, its oil minister said.
The southern Delta swamps, where many complain of poverty and oil spills, have been hit by militant attacks on oil and gas pipelines which have brought Nigeria's oil output to a 20-year low, and helped push oil prices to 2016 highs on Tuesday.
President Muhammadu Buhari had appointed a team led by the national security advisor ""to begin the process of a very intensive dialogue with those caught in the middle of this,"" Oil Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu said late on Monday, while Buhari was in Britain seeking medical treatment
""We are making contacts with everybody who is involved, the ones that we can identify, through them, the ones that we can't identify so that there is a lot more inclusiveness in this dialogue,"" he said.
""Our prayer is that this works so that we resort to dialogue rather than use of force,"" he said.
Kachikwu said the military would scale back its campaign to hunt down the militants in the southern region, which produces much of Nigeria's oil.
There was no immediate response from the Avengers group which has been issuing statements through its Twitter account.
A former militant group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, which laid down arms in 2009 under a government amnesty, accused the army of an ""disproportionate use of force"".
MEND, which was one of the largest militant groups, also said the Delta Avengers had attracted some of its former fighters. So far it has been unclear who is behind the Avengers.
""Many of whom were MEND commanders and fighters who jumped on the Presidential Amnesty gravy train without knowing why they took up arms in the first place,"" the MEND statement said.
Kachikwu also said Nigeria's oil output was between 1.5 million and 1.6 million barrels a day, down from 2.2 million barrels at the start of the year.

""Over the last two months, we have probably lost about 600,000 barrels from various attacks of militants in the area,"" he said.

1677,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2016 09:24PM ET</span>","Tropical Storm Colin gains speed, barrels toward Florida","By Letitia Stein
TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Colin picked up speed over the Gulf of Mexico on Monday as it headed toward Florida's northwest coast, unleashing thunderstorms and flooding while the state's governor activated the National Guard ahead of its landfall.
The storm, about 35 miles (56 km) from the Florida coast as of 8 p.m. eastern time, barreled toward land at 23 miles per hour, more quickly than it moved earlier in the day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said.
The combination of the storm surge and high tides threatened flooding in coastal areas across the U.S. Southeast, with the storm expected to make landfall below Florida's Panhandle on Monday night.
A tropical storm warning was extended to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. On its forecast path, Colin would churn across southeastern Georgia early on Tuesday and later in the day menace the North and South Carolina coasts.
As Colin blasted 50 mile-per-hour winds at Florida, tornado warnings were issued across the state. The storm was forecast to dump as much as 8 inches (20 cm) of rain on parts of the state, the hurricane center said.
Florida Governor Rick Scott, who had declared a state of emergency in 34 of the state's 67 counties, said more than 6,000 Florida National Guard members were activated and ready for deployment. Fast-moving squalls, tornados, flooding and property damage resulting from the fierce winds remained threats into the night, and far beyond the storm's immediate path, forecasters warned.
A statement from Scott's office warned residents to be wary of rip currents and the possibility of 10 foot (3 m) waves along the Gulf Coast.
""It is critical that all Floridians use caution and remain alert,"" he said in the statement.
In the St. Petersburg beach town of Gulfport, roads were already flooded. One resident used a kayak to float down a thoroughfare past a waterfront cafe that stayed open, allowing people used to severe weather to witness the storm.
""This is a mild tempest,"" said Trace Taylor, a local writer lunching on onion rings. “What’s there to be afraid of? It’s just water and it’s not that bad.""
More than 20,000 customers were without power ahead of the storm making landfall, local utilities reported.
The storm also threatened crops in Florida, the country's biggest citrus producer, which sent U.S. orange juice futures on Monday to their highest in more than two years. 

Colin is part of a brisk start to the Atlantic hurricane season that runs through Nov. 30. Over the U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend, the Carolinas were lashed by heavy rain and winds from Tropical Storm Bonnie.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery edged up 0.04% to $1,247.95 a troy ounce.
Silver futures for July delivery gained 0.14% to $16.470 a troy ounce, while copper futures for July delivery added 0.24% to $2.123 a pound.
Overnight, gold futures inched up, as the dollar erased slight gains on Monday afternoon after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen omitted any reference to the timing of the U.S. central bank's next interest rate hike in light of startlingly weak U.S. employment data last week.
Speaking before an audience at the World Affairs Council in Philadelphia, Yellen cautioned economists not to place too much significance to one report, after the U.S. labor market expanded by only 38,000 in May, marking the slowest period for monthly growth since September, 2010.
By comparison, Yellen noted that the economy added 2.7 million jobs in 2015 or an average of 230,000 a month. In May, economists expected to see gains of 158,000 on a seasonally-adjusted basis. Yellen also emphasized that average hourly earnings in the U.S. have increased 2.5% over the last 12 months, providing indications that wage growth may be on the verge of accelerating further.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has left the target range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a range between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its first three meetings this year. Last December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
""If incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening and inflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective as I expect, further gradual increases in the Federal Funds Rate are likely to be appropriate,"" Yellen said.
Investors who are bullish on gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed throughout the current cycle. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
Yellen also devoted a significant portion of her speech addressing broad areas of uncertainty within the global economy at large. Though Yellen noted that foreign headwinds have faded as the yuan has stabilized and Chinese outflows have abated in recent months, she said a potential Brexit by the U.K. from the European Union could bring ""significant repercussions,"" to the economy.
Yellen also reiterated that she expects inflation to move toward the Fed's long-term 2% goal in one to two years, as long as oil prices avoid further declines and the dollar avoids unforeseen shocks.

Elsewhere, the latest series of attacks by a group of militants known as the Niger Delta Avengers pushed daily output in Nigeria below 1 million barrels per day, Reuters reported. As the group sabotaged facilities in Southern Nigeria on Monday, production of Bonny Light crude in the region continued to fall sharply extending losses from last month when the rogue group staged at least 10 separate attacks. Since the onset of the strikes, output of Bonny Light has declined by more than 500,000 bpd. Nationwide, crude production in Nigeria last month fell to its lowest level in more than two decades.
The production disruptions in Nigeria have helped narrow the wide supply-demand imbalance on global markets. Each day producers worldwide pumped an average of 96 million barrels of oil during the first quarter, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency, as supply outpaced demand by 1.4 million bpd.

By the end of 2015, annual spot commodities trading volume had reached $4.5 trillion on more than 350 independent exchanges in China, according to data from Euromonitor. Trading volume grew 35 percent annually from 2011 to 2015. 
Investment bank Jefferies estimates there are more than 600,000 active spot commodities traders in China.
But while a bout of turbulence in major commodities futures markets last month triggered a swift response from regulators against ""speculation"", there remains little oversight over small regional exchanges. 
Despite issuing its warning last month on the risks investors faced playing such exchanges, the CSRC says it is not its job to regulate them. ""It's the local government's responsibility,"" said a CSRC official in Shaanxi, central China. 
Disgruntled investors and some analysts say that results in frequent conflicts of interest, as many small exchanges are backed by regional governments.
""These exchanges are big tax contributors to the local government, and are thus protected by them,"" said Chang Chengwei, an analyst at Hengtai Futures Co. ""At the same time, they're not supervised by CSRC. This is a regulatory loophole that puts many small individuals' money at risk.""
TRADING LOVE, ONLINE
Slowing growth is exposing cracks in China's financial system, where defaults are spreading.
Beijing recognizes the risks, and has launched a nationwide campaign targeting fraudulent investment practices. But new speculative hot spots pop up as fast as others are shut down.
Many small investors piled into commodities this year after an equities bubble burst, erasing more than 20 trillion yuan ($3 trillion) from China's stock markets.
Many retail investors have ended up on regional spot exchanges as commodity trading firms ratcheted up their sales pitch, with cold calls from sales representatives promising double-digit monthly returns.
Online dating sites, too, have become popular venues for the hard sell by some trading firms.
Users are lured into trading commodities by someone they meet on the site, thinking they are developing a personal relationship. They often end up losing tens of thousands of yuan before realizing the relationship is strictly business. 
""This has become the biggest type of scam on our site over the past year,"" a top executive at a leading Chinese online dating company said. 
The site has teams dedicated to blocking offending accounts, but they just reappear later under a new name, he said.
""LACK OF POLITICAL WILL""
The regulatory ambiguity is a major risk for established companies operating in the sector.
Shanghai-based Yintech Investment Holdings Limited , which operates an online platform for customers to trade gold and silver on three spot trading exchanges, raised more than $100 million in a Nasdaq initial public offering in April.
The company cited regulatory changes as one of the key risks to its business in its listing prospectus.
Jefferies, which was the bookrunner for the IPO, said in a May 25 report that a ""major risk to Yintech is if the Chinese government attempts to unify the regulatory bodies of the various exchanges"", but concluded that ""we do not believe there is enough political will to do so in the short run"".
Underlining the lack of clear rules in the sector, one of Yintech's key trading venues, a regional metals exchange in Tianjin, said last week it was adopting a new trading system that Yintech said was intended to remove a conflict of interest that meant brokerages could profit from their clients' losses.
    Although Tianjin Precious Metals Exchange accounted for 40 percent of Yintech's trading volumes in the first quarter, Yintech CFO Jingbo Wang told Reuters the changes would not affect its business.
The CSRC said in its warning last month that some regional exchanges were violating the rules on spot trading.
For example, some were conducting intra-day trading with clients, which is only allowed on futures exchanges, CSRC said. The regulator also said some deals were structured so that exchange members were effectively betting against clients.
""We're not trading with other investors,"" said businessman He, who lost money on the Shaanxi exchange. ""We're gambling against the exchange itself, at a great disadvantage.""
When Reuters contacted the Shaanxi branch of the CSRC concerning He's complaints against the Shaanxi Non-ferrous Metal Exchange, the questions were referred to the local government. An official at the finance department of the local government said it was looking into the matter, but ""it's very complicated and takes time"".
The exchange itself asked for questions to be submitted by email, but did not reply to the written questions.
Saleswoman Miao Lu, who handled He's account for a member firm of the exchange but has since left to start her own business, said there was nothing wrong with how it operated.
""You don't complain when you make money, right?"" she said. ""The Exchange just provided a platform. If you have confidence in your ability to make money, you just come and trade."" 
OIL LOSSES
Disillusioned by the stock market, bank clerk Wang Lili said she was coaxed into trading crude oil at the start of 2015 via a trading platform that is a member firm at the Beijing Petroleum Exchange and lost 1.1 million yuan in 10 months as prices fell.  
""The sales manager repeatedly told me that oil prices have bottomed out and it was time to buy,"" Wang, from the northern city of Tangshan, said. ""I trusted him because Beijing Petroleum Exchange is state-owned and is based in the capital.""
Sales agent Dong Hao, who handled Wang's account, said he no longer marketed for the exchange after an increasing number of complaints, but added that it was up to clients to control risks. ""If you lose money, and the casino operator makes money, there's nothing to complain about,"" he said. 
Beijing Petroleum Exchange's largest shareholder is the Beijing municipal state-owned asset management company. Other investors include PetroChina Co. Ltd. <601857.SS>, Sinochem Corporation, and CNOOC Investment Holding. None of the companies replied to phone calls or faxed requests for comment.
On March 18, China Central Television (CCTV) aired an investigative report alleging some oil products traded on the Beijing Petroleum Exchange did not have regulators' approval. 
In response to the CCTV report, Beijing Petroleum Exchange released a statement on March 25, saying it had launched an investigation into Shihang International, a member firm that was accused in the report of breaching rules by allowing futures trading.
Results of that investigation have not yet been published and Shihang declined Reuters' request to comment.
Hou Xiaoyu, a lawyer representing investors suing the exchange, said that, while it was only licensed for spot trading - which typically refers to contracts for immediate settlement - it allowed what he called quasi-futures trading.
Contracts traded on the Beijing Exchange are standardized, offer high leverage, change hands frequently and are not for the purpose of actually taking delivery of the products - characteristics of futures rather than spot trading, Hou said. 

Beijing Petroleum Exchange said in an emailed statement to Reuters that there had been problems with some of its member institutions, which it did not name. The exchange added that it has dealt with issues. ($1 = 6.5811 Chinese yuan renminbi)

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2016 04:00PM ET</span>",Isabel dos Santos promises overhaul of Angola's state oil firm,"By Ed Cropley
LUANDA (Reuters) - Isabel dos Santos, the billionaire daughter of Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, pledged a root and branch overhaul of state oil firm Sonangol on Monday to improve its efficiency and margins to offset the ""huge"" impact of depressed oil prices.
A presidential decree issued last week said Isabel, ranked as Africa's richest woman by Forbes magazine, would become chief executive after the shock firing of Sonangol's existing board by Angola's leader of the last 36 years.
The appointment was seen by some analysts as President dos Santos laying the ground for dynastic, family succession if he follows through on a declared intention to step down in 2018, a year after presidential elections.
However, others said it was possible he was serious about bringing about change at Sonangol. State media said experts from Boston Consulting Group and PricewaterhouseCoopers would be brought in to assist in the shake-up.
After being sworn in as chief executive, Isabel told reporters she was looking to split the firm into three units overseeing operations, logistics and concessions to international oil companies.
The 43-year-old businesswoman, a major investor in various Angolan and Portuguese telecoms, banking, media and energy companies, also pledged to improve transparency at Sonangol, the central pillar of sub-Saharan Africa's third biggest economy.
With militants blowing up pipelines and causing production outages in Nigeria's Niger Delta, Angola is currently Africa's biggest oil producer. Daily output is around 1.7 million barrels.
""Our objective is to increase the revenue, efficiency and transparency of the company,"" dos Santos said. ""We want to implement governance rules similar to the international standards.""
Angola, which relies on oil exports for 95 percent of its foreign exchange, is often cited by anti-bribery campaigners as one of the world's most corrupt countries. President dos Santos has said he has a ""zero tolerance"" approach to graft.
Isabel dos Santos also said she was looking into the possibility of developing a domestic oil refinery to reduce Angola's need to import nearly all its diesel and gasoline - about 6 million cubic meters a year, according to national statistics.
Asked about job cuts at one of the country's largest employers, she said only that she would be looking into ways of lowering production costs.
NEPOTISM CONCERNS
Foreign oil firms have welcomed Isabel's appointment, brushing aside concerns about explicitly political motives.
""The government has acted. It is clear the direction they want to go. I am always optimistic. I certainly support the direction Sonangol is taking,"" Chevron's (N:CVX) managing director for Angola, John Baltz, said last week.
However, one senior Johannesburg-based banker said the appointment could make it more difficult for international banks to do business with Sonangol, given the perception of nepotism it creates.
""From a compliance point of view, it's going to make it harder,"" the banker said.
President dos Santos's mild, inscrutable public demeanor belies his tight control of the former Portuguese colony, where he has overseen an oil-backed economic and construction boom in the wake of a devastating 27-year civil war that ended in 2002.

However, the collapse in oil prices has hit the economy hard, sending the kwanza  to record lows against the dollar, pegging back growth to around 3 percent and forcing the government to seek IMF assistance.

1682,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 06, 2016 02:56PM ET</span>","Brent closes at highest level of year, amid further slowdowns in Nigeria","Investing.com -- Crude futures remained near 8-month highs, while brent settled at its highest closing level of 2016 as fresh supply outages in Nigeria helped temporarily ease concerns related to persistent supply glut on global energy markets.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for July delivery traded in a broad range between $48.72 and $49.89 a barrel before settling at $49.70, up 1.06 or 2.18% on the session. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for August delivery wavered between $49.78 and $50.83 a barrel, before closing at $50.51, up 0.86 or 1.73% on the day. With the considerable gains, brent futures eclipsed previous yearly highs from May 26 when it eclipsed $50.50 for the first time since early-October.
Crude defied expectations for a sizable crash last week by moving only fractionally lower after OPEC concluded its semi-annual meeting without making any progress on a comprehensive output freeze between a host of major oil producers. While Iran and Saudi Arabia reportedly went to great lengths to appear conciliatory in public, the two main Persian Gulf rivals failed to reach a consensus on a long-term plan that could result in helping lift oil back to 2014 levels. Despite the recent bounce in oil prices, crude is still down more than 50% from its peak two years ago when it topped out at $115 a barrel. OPEC is scheduled to meet next in late-November.
Elsewhere, the latest series of attacks by a group of militants known as the Niger Delta Avengers pushed daily output in Nigeria below 1 million barrels per day, Reuters reported. As the group sabotaged facilities in Southern Nigeria on Monday, production of Bonny Light crude in the region continued to fall sharply extending losses from last month when the rogue group staged at least 10 separate attacks. Since the onset of the strikes, output of Bonny Light has declined by more than 500,000 bpd. Nationwide, crude production in Nigeria last month fell to its lowest level in more than two decades.
The production disruptions in Nigeria have helped narrow the wide supply-demand imbalance on global markets. Each day producers worldwide pumped an average of 96 million barrels of oil during the first quarter, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency, as supply outpaced demand by 1.4 million bpd.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 0.15% to an intraday high of 94.27, before turning slightly negative on Monday afternoon. It came after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen omitted the timing of a near-term rate hike from the U.S. central bank's current monetary policy outlook. The index has tumbled more than 5% since early-December.

1683,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 06, 2016 01:20PM ET</span>",Gold ticks up as Yellen omits timing of Fed's rate path outlook,"Investing.com -- Gold futures inched up, as the dollar erased slight gains on Monday afternoon after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen omitted any reference to the timing of the U.S. central bank's next interest rate hike in light of startlingly weak U.S. employment data last week.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded between $1,242.45 and $1,251.25 an ounce before settling at $1,248.25, up 5.35 or 0.43% on the session. At session-highs, gold reached its highest level in two weeks. It came one session after gold surged approximately $30 an ounce or 2.5% last Friday, as commodity traders reacted to an unexpected soft May jobs report from the U.S. Department of Labor. The rally transpired after gold plummeted by roughly 5% over a two-week period late last month, as Yellen and several other colleagues signaled that a rate hike could be imminent in the near-term future. Gold is still up by more than 15% since the start of the year, holding onto gains from the strongest first quarter of a year in more than a decade.
Gold likely gained support at $1,125.00, the low from February 3 and was met with resistance at $1,304.40, the high from May 2.
Speaking before an audience at the World Affairs Council in Philadelphia, Yellen cautioned economists not to place too much significance to one report, after the U.S. labor market expanded by only 38,000 in May, marking the slowest period for monthly growth since September, 2010. By comparison, Yellen noted that the economy added 2.7 million jobs in 2015 or an average of 230,000 a month. In May, economists expected to see gains of 158,000 on a seasonally-adjusted basis. Yellen also emphasized that average hourly earnings in the U.S. have increased 2.5% over the last 12 months, providing indications that wage growth may be on the verge of accelerating further.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has left the target range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a range between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its first three meetings this year. Last December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
""If incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening and inflation making progress toward our 2 percent objective as I expect, further gradual increases in the Federal Funds Rate are likely to be appropriate,"" Yellen said.
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed throughout the current cycle. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
Yellen also devoted a significant portion of her speech addressing broad areas of uncertainty within the global economy at large. Though Yellen noted that foreign headwinds have faded as the yuan has stabilized and Chinese outflows have abated in recent months, she said a potential Brexit by the U.K. from the European Union could bring ""significant repercussions,"" to the economy. Yellen also reiterated that she expects inflation to move toward the Fed's long-term 2% goal in one to two years, as long as oil prices avoid further declines and the dollar avoids unforeseen shocks.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose more than 0.15% to an intraday high of 94.27, before turning negative just before the close. The index has tumbled more than 5% since early-December.

Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning. 
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early summer cooling demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Natural gas for delivery in July on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to an intraday peak of $2.480 per million British thermal units, the most since January 11. It last stood at $2.419 by 14:35GMT, or 10:35AM ET, up 2.1 cents, or 0.88%.
The July contract soared more than 10% last week as warmer weather lifted cooling demand prospects for the fuel.
Gains were limited amid concerns over record-high storage levels. Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.907 trillion cubic feet as of last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 24.5% higher than levels at this time a year ago and 25.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Unless intense summer heat boosts demand from power plants, stockpiles will test physical storage limits of 4.3 trillion cubic feet at the end of October.
Elsewhere on the Nymex, crude oil for delivery in July jumped $1.19, or 2.45%, to trade at $49.81 a barrel, while heating oil for July delivery increased 1.1% to trade at $1.504 per gallon.

The renewed gain in U.S. drilling activity fueled speculation that domestic production could be on the verge of rebounding in the weeks ahead, underlining worries over a supply glut.
U.S. crude futures are still up nearly 80% since falling to 13-year lows at $26.05 in February as a decline in U.S. shale production boosted sentiment. However, with prices now at levels that make drilling economical for some firms, the oil rig count might start rising further and the decline in U.S. production may slow.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - More than 20 European and Asian-owned supertankers are shipping Iranian crude oil, data seen by Reuters shows, allowing Tehran to ramp up exports much faster than market analysts had expected following the lifting of Western sanctions in January.
Iran had been struggling as recently as April to find partners to ship its crude, but after an agreement on a temporary insurance fix more than a third of Iran's crude shipments are now being handled by foreign vessels.
""Charterers are buying cargo from Iran and the rest of the world is OK with that,"" said Odysseus Valatsas, chartering manager at Dynacom Tankers Management. Greek owner Dynacom has fixed three of its supertankers to carry Iranian crude.
Some international shipowners remain reluctant to handle Iranian oil, however, due mainly to some U.S. restrictions on Tehran that remain in place and prohibit any trade in dollars or the involvement of U.S. firms, including banks and reinsurers.
Iran is seeking to make up for lost trade following the lifting of sanctions imposed in 2011 and 2012 over its nuclear program.
Port loading data seen by Reuters, as well as live shipping data, shows at least 21 foreign tankers with capacity to carry around 25 million barrels of light and heavy crude oil have either loaded crude or fuel oil in the last two weeks, or are about load at Iran's Kharg Island and Bandar Mahshahr terminals.
The resumption of international shipping of Iranian oil has been made possible by an increase in interim, limited, insurance cover by ""P&I clubs"" - maritime mutual associations that provide ""protection and indemnity"" insurance to shippers.
The International Group of P&I Clubs, which represents the world's top 13 ship insurers, increased the amount covered by so-called ""fall-back"" shipping insurance from 70 million to 100 million euros ($111.53 million) in April.
""In the first days after lifting sanctions only Iranian ships were loaded in the country, mainly due to several problems in finding insurance/reinsurance,"" said Luigi Bruzzone of ship broker Banchero Costa.
""The strong interest of the market in these trades pushed all the stakeholders to solve all the problems ... and almost all P&I Clubs have granted their insurance.""
INSURANCE RISK?
The ""fall-back"" cover is designed to offset any shortfall in payments from U.S. reinsurers, who are still not allowed to deal with Iran.
""We are not surprised to see the increase in Iranian cargoes given the progress made by the P&I clubs and obviously the increase in Iranian production,"" said Brian Gallagher, head of investor relations at leading Belgian tanker owner Euronav, which itself is not involved in Iran yet.
""We're interested in such trade ... (but) it will still take time for Iran to be fully integrated as there remain restrictions around dollar denominated transactions.""
Indeed, while the partial lifting of sanctions means foreign tankers can now transport Iranian oil, there remains a risk to shipping it because large accidents might not be fully covered.
As a result, insurers say that large first-tier oil shippers, many of them publicly listed such as Euronav, Teekay Group or Frontline, still shy away from carrying Iranian oil.
If the fall-back cover is exhausted in an incident, Andrew Bardot, executive officer at the International Group of P&I Clubs, said that costs like ""collision and cargo liabilities, will not be covered, and will remain with the shipowner"".
A single Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) supertanker costs around $90 million, and the costs of a large oil spill can reach into the billions of dollars.
""The limitations of the 'fall-back' cover - together with other continuing restrictions, for example those relating to the U.S. dollar and use of the U.S. financial system - however have discouraged a number of shipowners, and in particular the large shipping groups, from resuming trade with Iran in which they were previously engaged,"" said Bardot.
NEAR PRE-SANCTIONS LEVELS
With international vessels supporting Iran's own tanker fleet, traders said that its oil production was now close to pre-sanction levels of around 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd).
""Iran has ramped up harder and faster than expected,"" Citi analysts said in a note to clients.
Iran's oil exports were between 2.1 and 2.3 million bpd in April and May, up from 1.3 million bpd a year ago, when Iran was shut out of the European market and dependent on limited shipments to Asian buyers.
Asia is the main destination for crude shipped by foreign vessels, with India, China and Japan the biggest takers, but at least four international tankers are also heading for Europe.
India, in particular, is taking a lead role as its demand soars and refiners such as Essar Oil, Reliance Energy, Hindustan Petroleum Corp, and Bharat Petroleum Corp enjoy good ties with Iran.
The non-Iranian companies currently chartered to carry its oil include Chinese state controlled shipper China Shipping Development, PetroVietnam and Japan's Idemitsu Kosan.

Greek, Turkish and Seychelles-owned tankers are also shipping Iranian crude. ($1 = 0.8966 euros)

Gold for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.53% to $1,249.50 a troy ounce.
Market players will be turning their attention to a highly anticipated speech by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Monday for further clues on the timing of the next U.S. rate hike.
The last full week before the Fed’s June 14-15 meeting is relatively light on data, with most of the focus likely to fall on consumer sentiment figures on Friday to gauge the health of the economy.

Also on the Comex, copper futures for July delivery edged up 0.05% to $2.120 a pound.
China is to release what will be closely-watched trade and inflation data later this week amid ongoing concerns over the health of the world's second biggest economy.
The Asian nation is the world’s largest copper consumer, accounting for nearly 45% of world consumption.
Last week, gold prices surged more than 2% on Friday, its biggest one day gain in nearly three months, as the U.S. dollar plunged after the release of dismal U.S. nonfarm payrolls data dampened optimism over the strength of the economy and lowered expectations for a summer rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
The U.S. economy added just 38,000 jobs in May, the smallest gain since September 2010 and far below expectations for an increase of 164,000. The economy created 123,000 jobs in April, whose figure was revised from a previously gain of 160,000, the Labor Department said Friday.
Also Friday, the Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager's index fell to 52.9 last month from 55.7 in April. It was the weakest reading since February 2014. Analysts had expected the index to drop to 55.5.
The downbeat data likely pushed a June interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve off the table, with traders pricing in just a 4% chance for a rate hike this month, down from 21% ahead of the data, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:CME) FedWatch tool.
Odds for a July rate hike dropped to 32% from 58% a day earlier, while September odds were at about 48%, compared to 66% on Thursday.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. interest rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2016 02:00PM ET</span>",Storms threaten East Coast; Florida under tropical storm warning,"By Letitia Stein
TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - While the U.S. West Coast sweated out a heat wave, forecasters warned of severe thunderstorms along the East Coast on Sunday and issued a tropical storm warning for Florida's Gulf Coast.
Weekend plans could be rained out for millions of people from New York through North Carolina, as thunderstorms were expected to blast winds up to 55 miles (90 km) per hour later on Sunday. Hail and tornadoes were also possible.
National forecasters also issued a tropical storm warning for Florida's Gulf Coast after a tropical depression gusting winds around 35 miles per hour formed about 125 miles northwest of Cozumel, Mexico.
The warning affected the coastline from Englewood to Indian Pass in the Florida Panhandle. The system was expected to strengthen into a tropical storm before approaching Florida's coast on Monday afternoon and evening, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.
On its current track, the center would land around the Big Bend region near the Panhandle, the agency said.
The storm could dump as much as eight inches of rain on the state, with the potential for one to three feet of flooding if storm surge occurs at high tide, the hurricane center said. Sandbags were being made available in the Tampa area.
Florida heightened the response level of its State Emergency Operations Center on Sunday to provide emergency planning and support, but had not fully activated all emergency functions.
""As we continue to closely monitor this tropical depression, Floridians should remain vigilant and have an emergency plan for their families and businesses in place today,"" Florida Governor Rick Scott said in a statement.
The storm, which forecasters will name Colin, is part of a brisk start to the Atlantic hurricane season running through November 30. Over Memorial Day weekend, the Carolinas were lashed by heavy rain and winds from Tropical Storm Bonnie.
Meanwhile, the western United States sweltered under a heat wave that was expected to bring record high temperatures.
The National Weather Service predicted temperatures well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) for parts of southern California, Arizona and Nevada, with unseasonable heat also afflicting inland areas of the Pacific Northwest.
In Texas, where torrential rains led to flooding last week that killed at least 16 people, the waters were expected to recede as the weather dries out, said Mark Null, hydrologist-in-charge of the National Weather Service's West Gulf River Forecast Center.

""It's going to be a slow drain,"" he said in a telephone interview.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2016 05:41PM ET</span>",Nigerian militants say aim is zero oil output after three new attacks,"By Libby George and Ulf Laessing
LONDON/ABUJA (Reuters) - The Niger Delta Avengers militant group has claimed responsibility for three new attacks on Nigeria's oil infrastructure, promising to cut production to zero.
The attacks are the latest in a Delta region conflict that a major local youth group said is ""rapidly deteriorating and getting out of control"", putting intense pressure on Nigeria's stretched finances.
The Nigerian Air Force, in a statement issued late on Friday, said it had deployed additional ""fighter aircraft, helicopter gunship and surveillance aircraft"" in troubled oil-producing areas to conduct ""offensive air operations and intelligence gathering"".
The army has moved reinforcements to the swamps in the last few weeks.
Early on Friday, the Niger Delta Avengers group said via its Twitter account it had blown up a pipeline in Nigeria's Bayelsa state owned by Italy's  ENI  (MI:ENI), hours after attacks on another ENI pipeline as well as one belonging to Shell (LON:RDSa) Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd (SPDC).
""At about 3:30am our (@NDAvengers) strike team blew up the Brass to Tebidaba Crude oil line in Bayelsa,"" the group said on a Twitter feed it uses to claim attacks.
Shell confirmed its 250,000 barrels a day Forcados pipeline had been hit again and was leaking. ""We have ... mobilized appropriate oil spill response measures,"" SPDC said in a statement.
The pipe had been shut in February after a seawater attack but a new strike might complicate three-month long repairs, for which the firm has brought in experts from abroad. Force majeur has been in place for Forcados crude since then.
The Niger Delta Avengers say oil firms are responsible for pollution and say the poor swampland region fails to reap any benefit from its reserves.
It said its attacks had brought Nigeria's oil production to just 800,000 barrels per day (bpd), from 2 million bpd, without killing anyone, though they hit infrastructure feeding crude grades already under force majeure.
The ENI pipeline is used to transport Brass River crude.
The group also hit ENI's Ogboinbiri-Tebidaba and Clough Creek-Tebidaba pipelines in Bayelsa and warned ENI not to start repairs or ""we will make you regrets it"".
ENI did not respond to a request for comment.
LOUD SOUND
Ayiri Appah, a resident of Ogboinbiri, where the ENI pipelines are located, said he ""heard a loud sound"" from the area between 2 and 4 am local time.
Three grades of Nigeria's oil - Forcados, Brass River and Bonny Light - are under force majeure, while  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) lifted force majeure on Qua Iboe, the country's largest export stream, on Friday.
Nigeria's oil minister said on Thursday that output was 1.6 million bpd. Even if the most recent attacks, which also included facilities belonging to  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) under its Escravos grade, took out all exports of the oil linked to them, June production would remain near 1.2 million bpd.
Experts said the violence showed little sign of abating, and would keep pressure on the Nigeria's oil production and finances. President Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim from the north, on Thursday canceled what would have been his first visit to the Delta region since taking office.
The Avengers have accused Buhari of ignoring local problems by having never visited the Christian region in the south.

The Ijaw Youth Council, which represents one of the largest ethnic groups, called on Buhari to ""urgently and personally take charge ... to return peace and normalcy to the region.""

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude for July delivery traded in a broad range between $48.34 and $49.41 a barrel before settling at $48.69, down 0.48 or 0.98% on the session. On the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), brent crude for August delivery wavered between $49.31 and $50.33 a barrel, before closing at $49.74, down 0.30 or 0.60% on the day. Oil prices remain near 7-month highs from late-May when WTI crude surged above $50 a barrel for the first time in 2016. Since falling to 13-year lows at $26.05 a barrel in mid-February, U.S. crude has surged by approximately 80%.
On Thursday, officials from OPEC's 13-member bloc broke off talks at their semi-annual meeting in Vienna without reaching a deal to cap its production ceiling. Although Saudi Arabia attempted to appease smaller members such as Venezuela, Ecuador and Nigeria by pledging to avoid major output increases in the coming months, Iran held firm on its plan to ramp up production to pre-sanction levels from 2007. Any coordinated attempts for a comprehensive production freeze likely will not occur until at least late-November when OPEC is scheduled to meet again.
Still, there is some optimism that Saudi Arabia and Iran have mended some fences in light of laudatory comments by Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh on new Saudi counterpart Khalid al-Falih. Last month, the Saudi kingdom replaced longtime oil minister Ali al-Naimi with Al-Falih, the head of state-owned oil firm Aramco.
""Saudi Arabia realizes that price is a key part of the oil-market formula -- it balances supply and demand,"" Al-Falih told reporters in Vienna. ""We realize that a long time under lower prices doesn’t bring enough supply to meet the rise in demand.""
Elsewhere, oil services firm Baker Hughes said in its Weekly Rig Count report that U.S. oil rigs rose by nine to 325 for the week ending May 27, the largest weekly increase since last December. As a result, the combined oil and gas rig count rose by four to 407, representing only its second weekly increase this year. Any gains in the weekly rig count typically send lagging indications that crude production is about to increase.
Crude prices also fell slightly on Friday in spite of a massive decline in the dollar. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, crashed more than 1.5% to a three-week low of 93.97. The index has tumbled more than 6% since early-December.
It came on the heels of a dismal May jobs report, released on Friday morning, which showed that the U.S. labor market added 38,000 jobs on the month, the slowest monthly gains in jobs since September, 2010. The downbeat report may also lower the odds that the Federal Reserve could lift short-term interest rates when it meets next on June 14-15. Any rate hikes by the Fed this year are viewed as bullish for the dollar, as market players pile into the greenback in order to capitalize on higher yields.

1699,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 03, 2016 01:02PM ET</span>",Gold surges as dismal U.S. jobs report dampens hopes for June rate hike,"Investing.com -- Gold surged more than 2%, amid a broadly weaker dollar, as markets largely ruled out a summer interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve following a dismal U.S. jobs report on Friday morning.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold for August delivery traded between $1,209.50 and $1,245.75 an ounce, before settling at $1,241.95, up $29.35 or 2.42% on the session. With the sharp gains, Gold enjoyed its strongest one-day rally in more than two months, erasing most of its losses from a recent rout. Previously, Gold tumbled approximately 5% since May 18, closing lower in 11 of 12 sessions. Nevertheless, Gold is still up by more than 15% since the start of the year, holding onto gains from the strongest first quarter of a year in more than a decade.
Gold likely gained support at $1,125.00, the low from February 3 and was met with resistance at $1,304.40, the high from May 2.
On Friday morning, the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said nonfarm payrolls in May rose by 38,000, less than a quarter of analysts' expectations for monthly job gains of 158,000. It marked the slowest monthly job growth since September, 2010 and raises questions on the strength of the broader economy following a downwardly revised total of 123,000 in April. As a result, the three-month average which hovered near 200,000 early this spring, crashed to 116,000.
The losses were concentrated among the information sector, which fell by 34,000, reflecting the six-week strike involving Verizon union workers that was settled last week. The manufacturing industry remained weak, losing 10,000 positions on the month, while jobs in the construction sector fell by 15,000, one month after spending in the industry dipped by the largest amount in five years. In addition, jobs in the temporary help services category, a leading indicator of future job growth, fell by 21,000. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dropped by 0.2% to 4.7%, as an estimated 500,000 Americans left the workforce last month. The labor force participation rate inched down 0.2% to 62.6%, while average hourly wages rose by 0.2% on the month. The average work week held steady at 34.4 hours.
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has left the target range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged at a range between 0.25 and 0.50% in each of its first three meetings this year. Last December, the FOMC abandoned a seven-year zero interest rate policy by raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Over the last year, Fed chair Janet Yellen has consistently reiterated that the FOMC will take a data dependent approach with the timing of its first interest rate hike this year. A cautious Fed may err on the side of leaving interest rates low at its next meeting on June 14-15, before reconsidering a rate hike in July. Complicating matters, voters in the U.K. could rattle the global economy later this month if they approve a referendum enabling Britain to depart from the European Union on June 23.
The CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Fed Watch tool lowered the probability of a June rate hike to 3.8% on Friday from 20.6% a day earlier. The CME Group also placed the odds a rate hike by the Fed in July at 34.6%, down from 48.6% on Thursday.
Investors who are bullish on Gold are in favor of a gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Fed. Gold, which is not attached to interest rates, struggles to compete with high-yield bearing assets in rising rate environments.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, crashed more than 1.5% to a three-week low of 93.97. The index has tumbled more than 6% since early-December.
Silver for July delivery gained 0.320 or 2.00% to $16.345 an ounce.
Copper for July delivery rose 0.041 or 1.98% to $2.111 a pound."
