The president also said he had ordered police to crack down on people hoarding face masks to sell at a higher price.
""The people don't have to buy necessities in droves. Buying them in droves is the thing that causes scarcity,"" he told reporters at the presidential palace in Jakarta.
Some residents in the capital and other cities rushed to purchase basics such as instant noodles after the president announced on Monday a mother and daughter had tested positive to coronavirus, the retailer association said.
The discovery of the first cases came after some medical experts had raised concerns about lack of vigilance and a risk of undetected cases in the country of more than 260 million people. But authorities have defended screening processes.
Chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto told reporters on Tuesday that retail associations would ensure supermarkets had sufficient supplies.
Widodo also said Indonesia was setting up a new hospital to treat coronavirus patients on Galang island near Singapore.
Navaratnasamy Paranietharan, the World Health Organization's Indonesia representative, said on Monday that more cases were likely."

Moscow was commenting a day after Syrian government forces entered parts of a strategic rebel-held town called Saraqeb with Russia's help. The Russian Defence Ministry said Russian military police had also entered Saraqeb.
""We hope that we're able to absolutely minimize this risk (of direct confrontation with Turkey) thanks to the close contact between the two countries' militaries,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about the risk of clash.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government unveiled its ""battle plan"" to tackle the spread of coronavirus on Tuesday, with possible measures including school closures, home working and cancelling large-scale gatherings to delay the peak of the outbreak.
The United Kingdom has so far had 39 confirmed cases of the virus, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday a ""very significant expansion"" was possible.
The government's plan says as many as one fifth of employees may be absent from work during peak weeks of the outbreak, and businesses could be given extra time to pay their taxes if they are facing short-term cash flow issues.
""It is highly likely coronavirus will spread more widely in the coming days and weeks, which is why we’re making every possible preparation,"" Johnson said. He later held a news conference on Tuesday alongside England's Chief Medical Officer and the government's Chief Scientific Adviser.
The plan includes the option of encouraging more home working and discouraging unnecessary travel as part of what it called a ""social distancing"" strategy to delay the peak of the outbreak until later in the year when the weather is warmer and the health service is under less seasonal pressure.
This would also give more time for testing of drugs and development of vaccines, the government said.
Other measures include looking at emergency registration for health professionals who have retired and delaying non-urgent health care. If staff shortages impact emergency services such as the police force, they will focus on responding to serious crimes and maintaining public order.
If the outbreak worsens or is severe and prolonged, the government said it would move from seeking to contain and delay the outbreak to mitigating its impact.
The government will launch a major public information campaign later this week, run from a ""war room"" in the Cabinet Office, setting out steps people can take to limit the spread of the virus, such as washing their hands regularly.
Johnson's office said it would also publish legislation in the coming weeks which would give the government necessary powers to prepare for and tackle the outbreak.
Health Minister Matt Hancock told BBC TV the government was not planning yet to cancel mass gatherings or large sports events, but said it did not rule out introducing ""no-go zones"".
The Treasury said finance minister Rishi Sunak had asked officials to draw up ""further measures to support the public health response, businesses and the economy as needed"" and would give an update when he presents his first budget to parliament on March 11."

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States on Monday said it was slashing the number of Chinese nationals permitted to work at the U.S. offices of major Chinese state-owned media outlets to retaliate against Beijing's ""long-standing intimidation and harassment of journalists.""
Describing the latest U.S. move as political oppression of the Chinese media, Beijing on Tuesday signaled that it intends to respond to the measures which it said have seriously harmed bilateral relations. 
Citing a ""deepening crackdown"" on all forms of independent reporting inside China, Trump administration officials said Beijing's attacks on free speech were worse than they were a decade ago, comparing them to those of the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War.
Effective March 13, Washington will cap the number of U.S.-based employees of Xinhua News Agency, China Global Television Network, China Radio International and China Daily Distribution Corp at 100 from 160 currently. Beijing's U.N. ambassador said the move was not ""appropriate"".
China last month revoked the visas of three Wall Street Journal reporters in Beijing after the newspaper declined to apologize for a column with a headline calling China the ""Real Sick Man of Asia"". Another reporter with the paper had to leave last year after China declined to renew his visa. 
""For years, the government of the People’s Republic of China has imposed increasingly harsh surveillance, harassment, and intimidation against American and other foreign journalists operating in China,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
Monday's decision was not particularly linked to the Wall Street Journal case nor the content the Chinese outlets in question produced, senior State Department officials told reporters, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
""We've been imploring the Chinese for years and years now to improve their treatment of journalists in China. So, this is not linked to any one particular incident,"" one U.S. official said, but added that the expulsion of Journal reporters was a ""fairly egregious"" example. 
At a briefing on Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters that Beijing resolutely opposes the latest actions by Washington and said it has never restricted the number of U.S. media outlets or journalists allowed to operate in China. 
""China reserves the right to make a response and implement measures,"" he said, adding that Washington is in reality ""expelling"" Chinese journalists. 
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying took to Twitter with a more strident message that appeared to threaten retaliation. 
""Now the US has kicked off the game, let's play,"" she wrote. 
While the U.S. officials said the move was not an expulsion of these Chinese nationals, they acknowledge that the people whose visas are contingent on their ability to work in the United States may be forced to leave the country.
The four outlets were among five designated by the United States as foreign embassies earlier this month, as a first step of this move.
FURTHER ACTION
Tensions between the two superpowers have escalated since President Donald Trump came to office three years ago, with disputes over issues ranging from trade to accusations of Chinese spying in the United States and to U.S. support for Taiwan.
On Monday, the Foreign Correspondents Club of China said in a report that the Chinese government has ""weaponised"" visas as part of a stepped-up campaign of pressure on foreign journalists.
""It is our hope that this action will spur Beijing to adopt a more fair and reciprocal approach to U.S. and other foreign press in China,"" Pompeo said, while State Department officials said Washington was ready to take further action if Beijing retaliated.
""If in fact they decide to take this in a further negative direction however of course...all options would be on the table. I can't tell you what in particular we would do, but we’d sit down review the circumstances and then consider all of our options,"" the official said.
The personnel caps would be placed on the entities as opposed to people hence it would be up to the media outlets to decide the necessary staffing cuts, the officials said.

The United States would also announce in the near future limits on duration of stay for Chinese journalists, administration officials said.

11,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 03:07AM ET</span>","After Malaysia's political turmoil, questions over trials in 1MDB scandal","By Rozanna Latiff
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Hours after Malaysia's change of leadership at the weekend, former prime minister Najib Razak posted a picture of himself smiling and giving a thumbs up on social media.
It was tagged as a gesture of satisfaction with a restaurant meal, but many Malaysians saw it as a bigger sign of happiness from a man who was driven from office in 2018 and is now on trial for corruption over the multi-billion 1MDB fund scandal.
With the return of Najib's party to power after a week of political turmoil, and therefore being in a position to influence policy, some Malaysians were questioning whether it will affect the handling of the high profile trials.
Mahathir Mohamad, who was ousted as prime minister in last week's realignments, accused Najib and his party of engineering last week's political crisis to help them avoid conviction.
""If Najib can be part of the government now, he can do all sorts of things to free himself,"" the 94-year-old told a meeting with his party’s youth members on Sunday.
Cynthia Gabriel, director of the Kuala Lumpur-based anti-corruption watchdog C4 Center, said: ""The worst case scenario is that these grand corruption trials will be dropped through judicial interference and more."" 
Najib has said he hopes to continue to fight his case in court.
In his first message, new Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said fighting corruption would be a priority for his government, whose biggest backer in parliament is Najib's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).
The prime minister made no specific mention of the trials.
Muhyiddin took over on Sunday from Mahathir, who had ousted UMNO in 2018 amid anger over the 1MDB scandal that stretched from Malaysia to the Middle East to Hollywood. Najib, his wife, UMNO's leader and others were quickly put on trial for corruption.
The U.S. Department of Justice estimates $4.5 billion was misappropriated from Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign fund between 2009 and 2014. U.S. and Malaysian authorities say over $1 billion stolen from 1MDB flowed into Najib's personal banks accounts.
The case has also led to scrutiny of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which Malaysia has accused of misleading investors over bond sales totaling $6.5 billion that the bank helped raise for 1MDB. Three units of the bank have pleaded not guilty.
Najib is facing five trials, the first of which - involving seven charges linked to $10 million misappropriated from a 1MDB unit - is expected to reach a verdict within months. 
He has consistently denied wrongdoing, saying he was misled by Malaysian financier Jho Low and other 1MDB officials. 
MULTIPLE TRIALS
Among 10 others on trial for corruption are Najib's wife Rosmah Mansor and UMNO party leader Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. Muhyiddin's office did not respond to a request for comment on what would happen to the trials now.
Najib did not respond to requests for comment but told reporters on Monday that he hoped to continue fighting his case in court.
""We’ll go through the court process,"" he said. ""It’s the only credible way.""
A senior UMNO official echoed Najib's sentiments, saying the new government should not interfere in the courts.
""If we interfere by withdrawing cases of those charged, the people would say the government does not respect the law and the judicial body is not independent; so, don’t mar that concept,"" party secretary-general Annuar Musa told state news agency Bernama. 
Although Najib was quick to post congratulations to Muhyiddin on social media, their relationship has been strained.
Muhyiddin was fired by Najib as his deputy in 2015 after questioning his handling of 1MDB. That led Muhyiddin to form the new party with Mahathir that brought them both back into office before it was torn apart in the recent political fighting.
Najib had not been directly involved in coalition talks even if he had tried to encourage Mahathir's downfall from behind the scenes, said one source close to the new prime minister who did not want to be identified. 
""Muhyiddin doesn’t want to deal with Najib,"" the source said.
Muhyiddin pointedly emphasized ""efforts to stamp out corruption"" in his first public speech on Monday. 
Despite his fall, Najib is an elected lawmaker and remains a senior figure within the UMNO party. He has a large popular base. His Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page has 3.9 million likes compared to 3.6 million for Mahathir's and fewer than 1 million for Muhyiddin's.
Workers at the Indian Muslim restaurant where Najib posted his selfie after Muhyiddin's swearing-in said he had been in a particularly good mood on Sunday.

""No matter how busy with politics, don't forget to eat first. Love yourself first,"" Najib's Facebook post said.

The volcano, located near the cities of Yogyakarta and Solo, is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes and a series of eruptions in 2010 killed more than 350 people.
Indonesia's Volcano Observatory Notice for Aviation issued a red alert and said the ash cloud was moving north. 
The international airport in Solo had been temporarily shut since 9.25 a.m local time (02:25 GMT), Indonesia's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said. Four flights had been affected.
The local disaster mitigation agency warned people to keep out of a 3-km exclusion zone around Merapi.
""Outside a 3-km radius it's still safe,"" Biwara Yuswantana, the head of Yogyakarta's disaster mitigation agency, told Reuters. The city is located about 30 km from the volcano.
The latest eruption, part of a series that started in 2018, sent up a column of ash that affected several neighboring areas, the country's Geological Disaster Technology Research and Development Centre said in a statement. 

It said the eruption lasted almost eight minutes and warned of a risk of further eruptions due to continuing movements of magma. The 2,930-metre (9612.86 ft) volcano is a popular site for tourists and its fertile soil is also farmed.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Twelve EU states are calling for the European Commission to speed the process of setting a new 2030 climate target to serve as an ambitious example at the next global climate summit, according to a letter to the Commission seen by Reuters. 
The European Commission wants to toughen the EU's 2030 climate target this year, to mandate a 50% or 55% cut in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels, rather than the current minimum of 40%.
But according to a letter signed by a dozen EU states the commission needs to present a climate target plan well before the U.N. climate summit in November to make time for EU members to agree on a final reduction target. 
""If the fact that the EU goes in front is going to have an effect, then it not only needs to be before the summit, but also well in advance,"" Dan Joergensen, Denmark's climate minister and initiator of the letter, told Reuters. 
Parties to the Paris Agreement on climate change are meeting at the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November, where they must commit to tougher targets of reducing emissions.
Under the Paris Agreement, each country made a pledge to curb domestic emissions. But the combined efforts of countries' current pledges would still put the world on track for around 3 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century, far above the level scientists say would avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change. 
The letter, addressed to EU's climate chief, Frans Timmermans, says discussions between member countries on EU's final 2030 target need to begin in June by the latest. 
That requires the Commission, the European Union's governing body, to have made its own recommendation and plan before that. 
""We therefore encourage the European Commission to present the 2030 Climate  Target  (NYSE:TGT) Plan as soon as possible and by June 2020 at the latest in order to advance discussions in a timely manner,"" the letter stated. 
The document, which was sent to the EU Commission early Tuesday, said a united European bloc could create ""momentum"" needed for the world's nations to sharpen their climate ambitions. 
Joergensen deemed it possible to finish negotiations if the plan was ready by June, but even that could pose a challenge.
""Right now we are in a situation where we fear we will not make it in time because the Commission's timeline does not suggest a proposal before September,"" he said. 

The letter was signed by Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Latvia and France.

14,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 01:55AM ET</span>",Explainer: Challenges facing new Malaysia PM after controversial takeover,"By Joseph Sipalan
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Muhyiddin Yassin was sworn in as Malaysia's new prime minister on Sunday after a week of political turmoil triggered by the surprise resignation of Mahathir Mohamad, but he has yet to name any cabinet colleagues.
The legitimacy of Muhyiddin's government, which came with the support of Malay nationalist parties he previously opposed, has been questioned by the opposing camp led by his former boss Mahathir.
WHAT HAPPENED?
Malaysia's king on Saturday named Muhyiddin, 72, as being the most likely candidate to be able to command a majority in parliament after days of political twists and turns.
Mahathir, 94, disputed the decision saying he instead had the numbers in the 222-member parliament. Mahathir, however, said he had not been able to convey to the palace that he had the majority.
In his first address to the nation, Muhyiddin defended himself.
""I know there are those who are angry with me. As expected, there are those who branded me a traitor. Listen well, I am no traitor,"" he said on Monday.
Mahathir resigned because he had been angered by pressure from supporters of old rival Anwar Ibrahim, 72, to set a timeline to hand power to him as part of a deal reached to fight the last general election together two years ago.
In the end, both Mahathir and Anwar got sidelined by their former coalition partner Muhyiddin, who moved quickly to seek support from people the other two would not work with.
WHAT COULD HAPPEN NEXT?
Muhyiddin's opponents have called for parliament to reconvene on March 9 as originally scheduled so that his majority claim can be tested.
That, however, will likely not happen, his supporters said, because the new premier needs time to first appoint ministers and focus on reviving the economy that grew at its slowest pace in the fourth quarter.
""By convention you need a cabinet, and then they need some time to adjust themselves to understand their ministries,"" said Wee Ka Siong, a lawmaker from the new ruling coalition. ""Then only can they answer questions.""
The last parliament session ended on Dec. 5, and according to the constitution, the first day of the new session must be held within six months of that, which in this case would be by June 5.
Mahathir said a delay in reconvening parliament may give ""these very rich and powerful people"" in the new ruling coalition time to try and secure a majority.
WHAT WILL CHANGE?
The return to power of parties that lost the last election may mean renewed focus on the country's decades-old positive discrimination policy for majority Malays, who enjoyed preferential access to everything from public financing to a 30% quota for equity holdings in businesses.
Unlike Mahathir's multi-ethnic government, the new administration may also be willing to put more Malays back into key positions, and veer towards religious conservatism in the largely Muslim country.
There have been some low-key protests against the new government by people who have accused it of disrespecting the 2018 mandate, which was driven by popular anger against alleged corruption by parties now backing Muhyiddin."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - When a rare moment of panic buying shook Singapore's highly ordered society over fears about the spread of coronavirus, it took a personal broadcast from the prime minister to bring calm.
As Lee Hsien Loong, a scion of Singapore's founding family, prepares to step down after elections expected this year, the handling of the virus has become the defining test for a new generation of leaders.
    ""How they handle a crisis, both the health and the economic crisis, will give confidence to Singaporeans on the ability of the 4G team to manage the country,"" said Inderjit Singh, a former MP for the People's Action Party (PAP) which has ruled Singapore since independence in 1965.
    4G refers to fourth generation, a term used to describe the group of ruling party politicians seen as future leaders.
While Lee's PAP is expected to win an election which must be held by April 2021, even small shifts in its support can lead to policy changes that impact many international firms based in the Asian business hub.
After its worst ever result in 2011 - when it still secured 60% of the vote - the PAP accelerated foreign labor curbs amid unease among citizens about immigration levels and the impact on job prospects and property prices.
The PAP declined to comment.
TOUGHER TEST
Singapore's battle with the disease is front-and-centre of voters' minds with virus cases now over 100, analysts say, overshadowing issues such as immigration and living costs that had been expected to dominate the election before the city-state's outbreak began in late January.
A poll last month by research firms Blackbox and Toluna showed 62% of Singaporeans were closely following virus news and information, more than in any of the eight other Asian places surveyed including Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong.
Singapore has won international praise for its virus containment efforts.
But analysts say managing the economic fallout, which could tip Singapore into recession following decade-low growth in 2019, will be a tougher task.
Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat - Lee's would-be successor - last month budgeted for the biggest deficit in years with billions earmarked for managing the virus' impact on firms and households.
""People may forget about how the government dealt with the public health aspect,"" said Eugene Tan, a former nominated MP. Nominated MPs are appointed directly by the president and not affiliated to political parties.
Tan said any perception of economic mismanagement over the virus would be a bigger issue in an election he expects by year-end, and any ""blunders"" over Singapore's response could hurt the ruling party well beyond that vote.
After 2018's historic government ousting in neighboring Malaysia, a vote that set off upheaval that has resurfaced in recent weeks, Lee said the party which he has led since 2004 did not have a ""monopoly of power"". https://reut.rs/2TgF4b4
Lee, 68, has said he plans to step down by the time he is 70.
The officials spearheading Singapore's virus fight have faced some criticism for what they said was a ""misunderstanding"" when they raised the virus alert level which sparked the panic buying of essentials like rice and toilet paper last month.
Trade minister Chan Chun Sing - another seen as a future party leader - called the panic buying disgraceful and idiotic in comments from a closed-door business briefing reported by local media.
Chong Ja Ian, political science professor at National University Singapore, said some people found Chan's remarks ""condescending"" and others ""frank and forthcoming"".
This ""mixed response"" to key individuals will also shape whether voters' are satisfied with the 4G's virus measures which is being ""couched as a litmus test for them,"" Chong said."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led on Tuesday in a cliffhanger election in Israel, but was still short of a governing majority in a third national ballot in less than a year, exit polls showed.
On the basis of initial projections by Israel's three main television channels, Netanyahu, head of the right-wing Likud party, claimed victory in Monday's vote over his main challenger, former armed forces chief Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White.
Updated exit polls, however, showed Netanyahu two seats short of a majority in Israel's parliament, a gap signaling possible deadlock, with actual results trickling in throughout Tuesday.
A win for Netanyahu, 70, after inconclusive ballots in April and September, would be testimony to the political durability of Israel's longest-serving leader, who fought the latest campaign under the shadow of a looming corruption trial.
It would also pave the way for Netanyahu to make good on his pledge to annex, after the election, Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, and the region's Jordan Valley, under a peace plan presented by U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Palestinians have rejected the proposal, saying it was killing their dream of establishing a viable state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Israel's three main TV channels initially projected that Likud and like-minded parties would capture 60 of parliament's 120-seats.
In their updated exit polls, Channels 11, 12 and 13 dropped the figure to 59, potentially making Netanyahu's coalition-building task harder.
During an acrimonious campaign which focused more on character than on policy, right-wing and religious parties had pledged to join a Likud-led government.
Netanyahu campaigned vigorously on his strongman ""security-first"" platform, familiar to Israeli voters over decades, and his loyal base of blue-collar voters has stood firmly behind him throughout, seemingly unfazed by his imminent trial.
""What a joyous night,"" a beaming Netanyahu told a cheering crowd in a speech at Likud's election headquarters in Tel Aviv. ""This victory is especially sweet, because it is a victory against all odds ... We turned lemons into lemonade.""
Gantz, in an address at his party's election headquarters, stopped short of conceding defeat, saying the election could result in another deadlock.
""I will tell you honestly, I understand and share the feeling of disappointment and pain because it is not the result we wanted,"" he said. 
A Likud spokesman said he expected Netanyahu would manage to gain a governing majority and establish a coalition government by getting lawmakers from the opposing camp to cross sides. ""There will be defectors,"" Jonatan Urich told Channel 12 News.

Netanyahu's re-election bid has been complicated since the last election by his indictment on charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud over allegations he granted state favors worth millions of dollars to Israeli media barons in return for favorable press coverage, and that he wrongfully received gifts. 
The first trial of a sitting prime minister in Israel is due to begin on March 17. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.
During the campaign, Gantz termed Netanyahu ""the defendant"", accusing him of seeking to retain power to promote legislation that would bar authorities from putting a serving prime minister on trial.
Netanyahu has portrayed Gantz, 60, as a ""coward"", saying he would need Arab politicians' support in parliament to form a government and that they would tie his hands.
The exit polls showed Likud taking between 36 and 37 parliamentary seats versus 32 to 34 for Blue and White - a gap that would make it far harder for Gantz to find a path to putting together a governing coalition.
In the previous election, in September, Blue and White edged past Likud, taking 33 seats to its rival's 32, but Gantz, like Netanyahu, was unable to put together a ruling coalition.
""While we need to wait for the final results, there is no doubt that Prime Minister Netanyahu has won a significant political mandate from the Israeli people,"" said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute.
""Israelis voiced their support for the man they perceive to have brought them security and prosperity,"" he said.
In the final days of the campaign, opinion polls had forecast further deadlock, but turnout was high, at 71 percent, despite concerns about the spread of the new coronavirus.

Voters under home-quarantine, such as those who have recently traveled back to Israel from coronavirus hot spots, voted at special polling stations wearing face masks and gloves.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 09:55PM ET</span>","'Provocative' China pressures Taiwan with fighters, fake news amid virus outbreak","By Yimou Lee and Ben Blanchard
TAIPEI (Reuters) - China is pressuring Taiwan with ""provocative"" air force maneuvers near the island and spreading fake news to sow discord during the coronavirus outbreak, security sources and government officials in Taiwan say.
The epidemic has strained already poor ties between Taipei and Beijing, with Taiwan especially angry at China's efforts to block its participation at the World Health Organization (WHO).
The two governments have also argued about the fate of about 1,000 Taiwanese stranded in Wuhan, the outbreak's epicenter, and China has made no obvious moves to respond to offers of help to fight the virus from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen.
Tsai won re-election by a landslide in January, pledging to stand up to Beijing. China believes she wants to push for formal independence for the island, which it claims as its own. Tsai denies that, saying Taiwan is already an independent nation called the Republic of China, its official name.
In the last month, Taiwan has reported three nearby Chinese air force drills, and in two cases Taiwanese fighter jets scrambled to intercept them.
Two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that in one instance, a Chinese fighter's radar locked onto one of the Taiwanese aircraft. In combat, that is a precursor to a missile launch.
""This was a very provocative action by China,"" said one of the sources, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Taiwan's air force said that it was unaware of the incident, but that it had full knowledge of Chinese military moves near the island.
China's Defence Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Last week, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Wu Qian, answering a question on the recent drills, said Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party was ""playing with fire"" and that any attempt at independence was ""doomed to fail"".
'EXTERNAL PROBLEMS'
China's actions have provoked anger in Taiwan, which has told Beijing it should focus on fighting the virus.
""Xi Jinping is trying to make the point that he is still in control of the military,"" Wang Ting-yu, a member of the Taiwan parliament's defense committee, told Reuters. ""China is using external problems to relieve domestic pressure.""
Accompanying the military moves has been what Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu has called a cyber ""war"" of fake news from China about the virus.
The fake reports, which Taiwan's government has quickly knocked down, include false claims that the island is covering up the true number of cases - officially at 41 and one death - and that Tsai has been infected.
Taiwan says many posts include expressions only used in China, as well as simplified Chinese characters, which are not used on the island.
Taiwan's Investigation Bureau has also warned that China is trying to undermine trust in factual news - and disrupt disease-control measures - by portraying Taiwan's official announcements on the outbreak as Chinese-made fake news.
So far, the pressure and online campaigns seem to have little effect.
A poll last week by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation reported high approval ratings for Tsai's China policy, as well as high mistrust of the Chinese Communist Party's ability to control the virus.
Tracking and reporting fake news on the virus outbreak suspected to have links to the ""mainland cyber army"" has become a top priority for several national security agencies in Taiwan, a security official told Reuters on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
China's Taiwan Affairs Office and internet regulator did not respond to requests for comment.
""We have been told to track if the origins are linked to instructions given by the Communist Party, using all possible means,"" the person said, adding that authorities have increased scrutiny on online platforms, including chat rooms."

The decision dashed the hopes of those who had looked to see abortion legalized in Colombia. The Andean country is part of a region that has some of the world’s strictest reproductive rights laws. 
The court rejected a case that looked to return the country to a ban on the practice in all circumstances, but also said it would not make abortion legal during the first four months of pregnancy. 
As before, abortion will only be allowed if a mother’s life is at risk, if a fetus is malformed or if the pregnancy is a result of rape.
The decision was met with outcry by human rights organizations and women's advocacy groups. 
“Today’s decision by the Constitutional Court was a missed opportunity to stand on the right side of history to provide Colombian women and girls safe access to abortion,” Paula Avila-Guillen, director of Latin America Initiatives at the Women’s Equality Center, said in a statement. 
Amnesty International accused the court of turning its back on women. 
""We regret that the court has decided to continue restricting women's sexual and reproductive rights instead of setting a positive example for the region, ”said Amnesty International Americas Director Erika Guevara Rosas. 
Anti-abortion campaigners 40 Days for Life were not immediately available to comment. 
Most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean apply similar restrictions to abortion as Colombia, while six countries in the region ban the procedure in all circumstances.

On Sunday, Argentine President Alberto Fernandez said he would send a bill to Congress within the next 10 days to legalize abortion in his country.

South Korea had reported two launches off the east coast into the sea on Monday, but KCNA made no mention of whether missiles were involved.
Photos released by state media showed troops firing a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS), first seen last year and estimated by analysts to be about 400mm-450mm in caliber. 
""The men of long-range artillery pieces on the front participating in the drill proudly demonstrated the accurate marksmanship which they had improved in their training,"" KCNA reported.
While smaller than some of the other short-range missiles fired by North Korea last year, analysts said the large MLRS are still a type of ballistic missile, and therefore a potential violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.
Monday's launch was the first since North Korea fired what it called ""super-large multiple rocket launchers"" on Nov. 28 and follow a year-end deadline North Korea has put forth for the United States to drop its insistence on unilateral denuclearization by Pyongyang.

21,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 07:25PM ET</span>",Differing U.S. documents helped fuel Afghan prisoner dispute,"By Jonathan Landay and Arshad Mohammed
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States helped fuel a dispute between the Taliban and the Afghan government over prisoner releases that threatens U.S. peace efforts by using different language in documents it agreed with each side, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The U.S.-Taliban deal says the Afghan government will free up to 5,000 Taliban detainees by March 10, while the U.S.-Afghan declaration commits the Kabul government only to taking part in U.S.-brokered talks on the ""feasibility"" of such a release.
The issue has emerged as a fresh impediment to peace talks between the insurgents and a yet-to-be-named Kabul delegation that are to begin on March 10 under the U.S.-Taliban agreement for a U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan signed on Saturday.
The Taliban on Monday said they would not participate in the so-called intra-Afghan peace talks until Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's government releases about 5,000 military and political prisoners.
Ghani on Sunday said the issue cannot be a precondition to the peace talks and will have to be worked out in negotiations. ""It is not in the authority of United States to decide, they are only a facilitator,"" he said.
Sources familiar with the matter identified the discrepancy as a significant potential obstacle to the talks and, by extension, to U.S. President Donald Trump's desire to pull U.S. forces out of Afghanistan.
""There is going to have to be a compromise,"" said a former senior U.S. official familiar with the issue who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""The question is whether (the Afghan sides) can do it themselves or America has to play the heavy.""
Asked about the discrepancy, a second source familiar with the matter said: ""It's clearly a problem.""
""I am sympathetic to Ghani. This is his leverage in the negotiation. For the U.S. to negotiate away his leverage before they even get to the negotiating table I imagine was somewhat galling,"" the second source said on condition of anonymity.
The Kabul government's stance appears to be supported by the joint declaration Ghani and U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper issued in Kabul shortly before Saturday's signing of the U.S.-Taliban accord in the Qatari capital Doha.
That statement said the Afghan government will take part in a ""U.S.-facilitated discussion with Taliban representatives on confidence-building, to include determining the feasibility of releasing significant numbers of prisoners on both sides.""
In contrast, the U.S.-Taliban agreement appears to commit Kabul to releasing up to 5,000 prisoners even though the Ghani government was excluded from the negotiations with the Taliban led by Zalmay Khalilzad, chief U.S. negotiator.
""Up to five thousand (5,000) prisoners of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan will be released,"" while the insurgents would free up to 1,000 prisoners, the document says.
The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the discrepancy.
Asked in a Fox News interview about Ghani's refusal to release up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""It shouldn't surprise anyone that the habits of old days are hard to break. And this will be a bumpy road going forward.""
The U.S.-Taliban pact could pave the way to ending the nearly 19-year U.S.-led international military presence in Afghanistan.
The United States said it was committed to cutting its troop levels to 8,600 from 13,000 within 135 days of signing the deal, and working with its allies to proportionally reduce the number of coalition forces in Afghanistan over that period, if the Taliban adhere to their commitments.
Richard Olson, a former U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said the prisoner dispute could delay the intra-Afghan talks and violence could rise after the Taliban's announcement that it could resume operations against government forces but not U.S.-led international troops.
""That is one of the things that could begin driving a wedge between Afghan forces and U.S. forces,"" Olson said."

KASTANIES/LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - A young Syrian boy died on Monday after being pulled from the sea when a boat capsized off the Greek island of Lesbos, Greek officials said, the first reported fatality since Turkey opened its border last week to let migrants reach Europe.
Separately, two Turkish security sources told Reuters a Syrian migrant had died from injuries on Monday after Greek security forces intervened to prevent migrants crossing from Turkey into Greece, but Athens branded the claim ""fake news.""
More than 10,000 migrants, mostly from Syria, other Middle Eastern states and Afghanistan, have reached Turkey's land borders with EU states Greece and Bulgaria since Ankara said last Thursday it would stop keeping them on its territory.
Farther south, at least 1,000 migrants have reached Greece's eastern Aegean Islands since Sunday morning, Greek police said.
""This is an invasion,"" Development Minister Adonis Georgiadis told Skai TV.
The surge, which has led to Greek and Turkish police firing tear gas into crowds caught in the no-man's land between the two borders, has revived memories of the 2015-16 refugee crisis, when more than a million people arrived in Europe from Turkey.
""We have children four days without food,"" one man shouted from behind a wall of barbed wire near the Kastanies border post as Greek riot police stood ready to repel any breaches of the frontier. Nearby soldiers unrolled more coils of barbed wire.
The migrants, some with white flags, chanted ""Peace!""
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' office said he had discussed the border situation with U.S. President Donald Trump who, it said, had ""recognized the right of Greece to enforce the law on its borders."" 
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, who keeps warm ties with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, flew to Ankara on Monday to meet him. Bulgaria has seen no significant migrant inflows.
Borissov said he had tried to arrange a meeting between Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria but Erdogan was unwilling to sit at the same table with Mitsotakis. Erdogan said that Greek soldiers had killed two migrants and wounded a third one. Greek government officials denied it.
""No shots have been fired by Greek border forces against any individuals attempting to enter the country illegally,"" government spokesman Stelios Petsas tweeted. 
The boat that capsized off Lesbos had been escorted there by a Turkish vessel, the Greek coast guard said, underlining the escalating tensions between Ankara and Athens. The dead boy was aged about six, they said, but provided no other details.
More boats arrived at Greece's islands on Monday.
About 4,000 people are believed to have drowned in the Aegean during the 2015-16 crisis trying to reach Europe, while some 42,000 migrants are still living in severely overcrowded camps on the Greek islands.
'WE'RE STUCK HERE'
The latest migrant surge follows Turkey's decision to stop enforcing a 2016 accord with the European Union whereby it stopped migrants entering the bloc in return for cash.
Turkey, already home to 3.7 million Syrian refugees, has another million arriving on its doorstep from a new surge of fighting in northern Syria and says it cannot handle any more.
Greece accuses Turkey of orchestrating a coordinated effort to drive migrants across the frontier.
One Greek policeman accused Turkish soldiers at the Kastanies border gate of ""giving cutters"" to migrants to cut holes in the fence to get through. Reuters could not verify the report.
Some migrants camped near the border had erected makeshift tents or built bonfires to stay warm.
""What can we do, we're stuck here, we can't go back home and we can't cross (the border),"" said Jamal Kassar, a Syrian migrant. 
Greeks living near the border said they were tired of seeing waves of migrants passing through.
The EU's chief executive, Ursula von der Leyen, expressed sympathy on Monday with Turkey over the conflict in Syria but said its decision to let refugees and migrants cross into Europe ""cannot be an answer or solution.""
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also said Turkey should not express its dissatisfaction with the EU ""on the back of refugees.""
Von der Leyen was due to visit the Greek-Turkish border on Tuesday with Mitsotakis.

Erdogan opened Turkey's border after at least 33 Turkish soldiers sent to Syria to monitor a crumbling ceasefire there were killed last week.

GENEVA/BEIJING (Reuters) - The new coronavirus appears to now be spreading much more rapidly outside China than within, and airports in hard-hit countries were ramping up screening of travelers.
World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said almost eight times as many cases had been reported outside China as inside in the previous 24 hours, adding that the risk of coronavirus spreading was now very high at a global level.
At a briefing in Geneva, he said outbreaks in South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan were the greatest concern, but that there was evidence that close surveillance was working in South Korea, the worst affected country outside China, and the epidemic could be contained there.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said that within 12 hours, airports across South Korea and Italy will screen all travelers for coronavirus. Pence, who has been put in charge of the U.S. response to the outbreak, also said U.S. travel restrictions may expand.
The head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said U.S. industry expects to have the capacity to perform 1 million coronavirus tests by the end of the week.
The global death toll exceeded 3,000, with the number of dead in Italy jumping by 18 to 52. Latvia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal and Morocco reported cases for the first time, bringing the total to more than 60 countries with the illness known as COVID-19.
But equity markets surged after their worst plunge since the 2008 financial crisis last week, encouraged by the prospect of government action to stem the economic impact. In the United States, the Dow jumped nearly 1,300 points, or 5%, while the S&P 500 closed 4.6% higher.
Finance ministers of the G7 group of leading industrialized democracies were expected to discuss measures in a conference call on Tuesday, sources told Reuters.
Oil prices jumped 4% amid hopes of a deeper output cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

MORE THAN PREDICTED
A senior U.S. official said he was concerned about a likely jump in the number of cases in the United States, which has had more than 90, with six deaths. More testing will almost surely lead to more confirmed cases.
""When you have a number of cases that you've identified and they've been in the community for a while, you're going to wind up seeing a lot more cases than you would have predicted,"" Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the infectious diseases unit at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, told CNN.
South Korea has had 26 deaths and reported another 599 infections on Monday, taking its tally to 4,335.
Of the new cases in South Korea, 377 were from the city of Daegu. That is home to a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, to which most of South Korea's cases have been traced after some members visited the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the disease emerged.
The Seoul government asked prosecutors to launch a murder investigation into leaders of the church. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said that if founder Lee Man-hee and other heads of the church had cooperated, fatalities could have been prevented.
Lee knelt and apologized to the country, saying that one church member had infected many others and calling the epidemic a ""great calamity"".
It was not immediately known how many of South Korea's dead were members of the church.

'OUTBREAKS ARE CURBED'
But Wuhan itself, at the center of the epidemic, shut the first of 16 specially built hospitals that were hurriedly put up to treat coronavirus cases, the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said.
There was also a steep fall in new cases in Hubei, the province around Wuhan, but China remained on alert for people returning home with the virus from other countries.
The virus broke out in Wuhan late last year and has since infected more than 86,500 people, mostly in China.
Only eight cases were reported in China beyond Hubei on Sunday, the WHO said.
China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun at a news conference said: “We definitely believe that with the coming of spring we’re not far from the coming of the victory of the final defeat of COVID-19.”
Outside China, there are now more than 8,700 infected and over 125 deaths.
Iran, one of the worst-hit nations, reported infections rising to 1,501, with 66 deaths, including a senior official. With stocks of gloves and other medical supplies running low in pharmacies, authorities uncovered a hoard of supplies including millions of gloves.
In Britain, which has 40 confirmed cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to be prepared for a further spread.

VIENNA/PARIS (Reuters) - The U.N. atomic watchdog policing Iran's nuclear deal with major powers plans to issue an imminent rebuke to Tehran for failing to provide access to one or more sites that are of interest to it, several diplomats who follow the agency said on Monday.
The International Atomic Energy Agency overseeing the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement, which lifted international sanctions against Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear activities, issues quarterly updates on Iran's atomic program to its member states.
The next of those quarterly reports is due on Tuesday but, in a first for the IAEA since the deal was put in place, the agency plans to issue a separate report on the same day, calling Iran out for its lack of cooperation in general and its failure to provide access in particular, diplomats said.
""The general message is: There's a new sheriff in town,"" a diplomat from a country on the IAEA's 35-nation Board of Governors said, referring to new IAEA chief Rafael Grossi of Argentina, who was elected in October with the support of countries including the United States and Brazil.
Grossi took over following the death in office of long-serving IAEA chief Yukiya Amano of Japan, who pressured Iran to provide swifter access to sites of interest to the agency, while avoiding confronting the Islamic Republic publicly, diplomats say.
Under Amano, the IAEA at first resisted public pressure from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to visit a site he cited in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in 2018, calling it a ""secret atomic warehouse"" mentioned in a trove of data seized by Israeli intelligence agents. Tehran has said the site is a carpet-cleaning facility.
But the IAEA inspected the site in February of last year, diplomats say, and gathered environmental samples that showed traces of uranium that Iran has yet to fully explain.
Now the agency is seeking access to one or more sites mentioned in that trove, which Israel refers to as the ""atomic archive"" of information on Iran's former nuclear weapons program. 
A spokesman for the IAEA declined immediate comment.
U.S intelligence agencies and the IAEA both believe Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program that it halted long before the 2015 nuclear deal. That deal is aimed at keeping Tehran at least a year away from obtaining enough fissile material for an atom bomb if it sought one.
Iran denies ever having had a nuclear weapons program and says it would never seek to obtain an atom bomb.
It has, however, breached the deal's restrictions on its atomic activities one after the other in response to Washington's withdrawal from the deal in May 2018 and its reimposition of sanctions that have choked off the Islamic Republic's vital oil exports.
""The second report will be on Safeguards issues linked to sites that the IAEA did not get access to. We know of two cases, but we don't know whether the IAEA will put both in (the report),"" said a European diplomat, adding it was unclear what recommendations the agency would make. 
Other diplomats said there would be at least one site mentioned in the report, possibly two, and that there was a connection to the archive.
None of the six diplomats who said they expected a second report provided details of the site or sites the reports would likely mention.
NO SUDDEN MOVES
Iran's breaches of the deal's nuclear limits on items including the purity to which it enriches uranium and its stock of enriched uranium are eroding the accord, but it says they can quickly be reversed if U.S. sanctions are lifted.
The Trump administration says its ""maximum pressure"" campaign will force Iran to negotiate a more sweeping deal than the strictly nuclear agreement.
Washington wants a broader deal, covering issues such as Iran's ballistic missile program and its role in Middle Eastern conflicts like those in Syria and Yemen. It also wants to ban Iran from enriching uranium altogether. Tehran says it will not negotiate unless U.S. sanctions are lifted.
Tuesday's main IAEA quarterly report is likely to show a jump in Iran's stock of enriched uranium as Tehran continues to breach key limits of the steadily eroding nuclear deal, diplomats say.
But while Iran breached the deal's atomic restrictions in the second half of last year, it has refrained from making any large, sudden moves this year, even after the U.S. assassination of its powerful military leader Qassem Soleimani in January, diplomats say.

The level to which it is enriching uranium, for example, remains roughly the same as in the last quarterly report, diplomats say - 4.5% or less, above the deal's 3.67% limit but still far below the 20% Tehran achieved before the deal and the roughly 90% that is weapons-grade.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Half the world's sandy beaches may be wiped away by the end of the century due to rising sea levels and other climate change effects, with Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, China and the United States among the hardest hit, researchers said on Monday.
Many beaches that attract frolicking vacationers may be turned into rocky remnants as rising seas, changing weather patterns and other factors erode sandy shorelines that now account for more than a third of global sea coasts, they added.
A large proportion of shoreline in densely populated areas is projected to be lost.
""Touristic areas which have sandy beaches as their main selling point will probably face strong consequences,"" said coastal oceanographer Michalis Vousdoukas of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Climate Change.
Aside from economic value, sandy shorelines play a vital environmental role.
""Sandy beaches are important habitats supporting a wide range of species. They also protect the coast from the effects of storms, so without sandy beaches other inland environments can be affected by the effects of waves and saltwater intrusion,"" Vousdoukas added.
A rise in global sea levels has accelerated in recent decades, with the major causes seen as thermal expansion - water expands as it warms - and melting of land-based ice such as glaciers and ice sheets.
The researchers analyzed satellite images showing shoreline changes during the past three decades and applied these trends to two climate change scenarios looking forward, one envisioning a moderate mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change and the other envisioning high emissions.
By 2050, the researchers projected losses of 13.6% to 15.2% of global beaches, amounting to 22,430 to 25,172 miles (36,097 to 40,511 km) of lost sandy shorelines. By 2100, they projected losses of 35.7% to 49.5% of beaches spanning 59,068 to 81,862 miles (95,061 to 131,745 km).
Australia would lose more sandy shoreline than any other country, with up to 9,227 miles (14,849 km) projected to be gone by 2100, about half its current total sandy coastline.
Canada ranks second in projected losses (up to 8,963 miles/14,425 km). It is followed by Chile (up to 4,138 miles/6,659 km), Mexico (up to 3,410 miles/5,488 km), China (up to 3,380 miles/5,440 km), the United States (up to 3,436 miles/5,530 km), Russia (up to 2,959 miles/4,762 km) and Argentina (up to 2,323 miles/3,739 km)."
28,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 04:51PM ET</span>",Netanyahu set to declare narrow victory in Israeli election: party spokesman,"By Jeffrey Heller
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to declare victory in Israel's election on Monday, a spokesman for his party said, after television exit polls showed him just a seat short of a governing majority in parliament.
A win for Netanyahu, after inconclusive ballots in April and September, would be testimony to the political durability of Israel's longest-serving leader, who fought the latest campaign under the shadow of a looming corruption trial.
It would also pave the way for Netanyahu to make good on his pledge to annex, after the election, Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, and the region's Jordan Valley, under a peace plan presented by U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Palestinians have rejected the proposal, saying it was killing their dream of establishing a viable state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
A spokesman for Netanyahu's right-wing Likud said the prime minister would deliver a victory speech at the party's election headquarters in Tel Aviv at 2145 GMT.
Israel's three main TV channels projected Likud and like-minded parties would capture 60 of parliament's 120-seats, just one short of a majority.
""A giant victory for Israel,"" Netanyahu, 70, tweeted after the projections were released.
His main challenger, former armed forces chief Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party, stopped short of conceding defeat in his own posting on Twitter, telling supporters he would ""continue to fight for the right path, for you.""
During the campaign, right-wing and religious parties had pledged to join a Likud-led coalition government. But if the 60-seat projection held true, after actual results on Tuesday, Netanyahu would still have to enlist other allies in coalition negotiations.
A Likud spokesman said that after the exit polls were released Netanyahu telephoned the leaders of parties that have already partnered with Likud and ""they agreed to form a strong, national government in Israel soon.""
The exit polls showed Likud taking between 36 and 37 parliamentary seats to 32 or 33 for Blue and White - a gap that would make it far harder for Gantz to find a path to putting together a governing coalition.
In the previous election, in September, Blue and White edged past Likud, taking 33 seats to its rival's 32, but Gantz, like Netanyahu, was unable to put together a ruling coalition.
Anshel Pfeffer, who wrote a biography of Netanyahu, said on the website of the left-wing Haaretz newspaper that a win for the veteran politician would be a ""stunning comeback"" for a man ""who doesn't lie down after a setback"".
SECURITY FIRST
Netanyahu campaigned vigorously on his strongman ""security-first"" platform, familiar to Israeli voters over decades, and his loyal base of blue collar voters has stood firmly behind him throughout, seemingly unfazed by his imminent trial.
""While we need to wait for the final results, there is no doubt that Prime Minister Netanyahu has won a significant political mandate from the Israeli people,"" said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute.
""Israelis voiced their support for the man they perceive to have brought them security and prosperity,"" he said.
Netanyahu's re-election bid has been complicated since the last election by his indictment on charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud over allegations he granted state favors worth millions of dollars to Israeli media barons in return for favorable press coverage and that he wrongfully received gifts. 
The first trial of a sitting prime minister in Israel is due to begin on March 17. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.
During the campaign, Gantz termed Netanyahu ""the defendant"" and has accused him of seeking to retain power to promote legislation that would bar authorities from putting a serving prime minister on trial.
Netanyahu has portrayed Gantz, 60, as a ""coward"", saying he would need Arab politicians' support in parliament to form a government and that they would tie his hands.
In the final days of the campaign, opinion polls had forecast further deadlock, but turnout was high despite concerns about the spread of the new coronavirus.

Voters under home-quarantine, such as those who have recently traveled back to Israel from coronavirus hot spots, voted at special polling stations wearing face masks and gloves.

TIRANA (Reuters) - Thousands of opposition supporters denounced Albania's government at a protest rally on Monday in a move likely to deepen a row between the country's president and the socialist administration over judicial reforms sought by the West. 
Some 8,000 supporters cheered President Ilir Meta when he accused Prime Minister Edi Rama's government of enacting a ""coup d'etat"" against the constitution and of having ties to organized crime.
In a process monitored by European and U.S. experts, Albania is vetting 850 judges and prosecutors to try to identify and kick out corrupt members of the judiciary.
The European Union has told Albania the reforms must remain a top priority if it wants to join the bloc and the judiciary should have teeth in the fight against corruption and crime.
So far, most Supreme and Constitutional Court judges have been fired, prompting many Albanians to say they were right to view the judiciary as corrupt. However, the opposition says the government is trying to exert undue control over the reformed judicial system.
While filling vacancies for the Constitutional Court, the Socialist-dominated assembly and Meta clashed late last year over the nomination of a judge, with Meta arguing that a body nominating judges had tricked him out of his right also to make nominations. 
""To defend democracy, my first duty is to lead the fight against the coup d'etat...,"" Meta told the crowd. 
""Death to the coup d'etat, long live the rule of law, long live the Republic.""
When Meta in mid-November refused to swear-in a candidate proposed by parliament, the Socialists went on to pass a bill saying a judge could take the oath at a notary public if the president did not receive him or her.
Justice Minister Etilda Gjonaj has said they had followed the procedure to the letter and the ""president had created a fictitious cause to serve his own battles"".
After reviewing the rule of law reforms by Albania and North Macedonia, the EU's executive said both countries ""have delivered further tangible and sustainable results...""
""..and therefore the Commission’s recommendation to open accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia remains valid,"" the European Commission said in a statement.
At the rally, Meta signed an official order repealing the bill, although the move appeared to be symbolic, since the proposed legislation now returns to parliament for further consideration.
A parliamentary committee convened by the Socialists has met several times in recent months to discuss the possibility of sacking Meta for cancelling local elections last June after the opposition parties refused to take part. The poll went ahead.

ANKARA/AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian government forces entered parts of a strategic rebel-held town on Monday, and Turkey said it would keep hitting President Bashar al-Assad's troops after ramping up operations in its biggest intervention yet into the Syrian civil war.
Turkey and Russia, which have come closer than ever to direct confrontation in Syria in recent days, traded threats over air space after Turkish forces shot down two Syrian government warplanes and struck a military airport. 
Fighting has escalated dramatically in recent days in northwest Syria, where Turkey has sent thousands of troops and military vehicles in the last month to counter Syrian government forces' advances in the last remaining bastion held by rebels.
A million people have been displaced since December near Turkey's southern border, causing what the United Nations says may be the worst humanitarian crisis in nine years of war.
A Syrian state television correspondent in the town of Saraqeb said the army was combing the town after the retreat of Turkey-backed rebels. Rebel sources said clashes were continuing in western parts of the town. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor group said rebels were trying to regain control.
Saraqeb has already changed hands twice in less than a month, reflecting its importance as a gateway to the government-controlled northern city of Aleppo and to rebel-held Idlib city to the west.
Rebels said Turkish drones had been striking Syrian army positions on the Saraqeb frontline, hitting at least two rocket launchers. Turkey's Defense Ministry said one of its soldiers was killed and another wounded in shelling by Syrian government forces in Idlib on Monday.
Turkey, which has backed rebels fighting Assad for much of Syria's nine-year civil war, stepped up its intervention in response to the killing of 34 Turkish soldiers in Idlib last week, the deadliest strike against the Turkish army in decades.
On Sunday it shot down two Syrian planes in Idlib and struck at least one military airport in Aleppo province, taking the battle deep into territory controlled by forces loyal to Assad.
""The (Syrian) regime's human and equipment losses are just the beginning,"" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech in Ankara. ""If they do not withdraw to the borders Turkey has determined as soon as possible, they will not have a head left on their shoulders.""
Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said Turkish forces had so far destroyed eight helicopters, scores of tanks and five air defense systems.
Russia, for its part, said it could not guarantee the safety of Turkish aircraft over Syria, and Damascus said it was closing Syrian air space over the Idlib region.
HOPES FOR PUTIN TALKS
Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin are due to meet in Moscow on Thursday to seek agreement on Idlib.
""We will go to Moscow to evaluate these developments with Mr. Putin. My hope is that we take the necessary steps there, whether it is a ceasefire or any other steps needed,"" Erdogan said.
Turkey has insisted it seeks no conflict with Moscow, but its barrage of strikes on the Russian-backed forces around Idlib have raised the risk of a direct confrontation.
""A solution is expected to emerge from the talks but attacks and attempts which the (Syrian) regime carries out in this period will not go unanswered,"" a senior Turkish security official told Reuters.
Backed by Turkish shelling and drone strikes, rebels say they have now retaken several villages that they lost last week in the Syrian government offensive. 
Erdogan demanded in early February that Syrian forces withdraw by the end of the month from a ""de-escalation zone"" around Idlib agreed by Turkey, Russia and Iran in 2017, or face being driven back by the Turkish military. 
""The (Syrian) regime will be forced to leave the de-escalation zone before the Putin-Erdogan meeting,"" a senior Syrian opposition source said.
Already hosting 3.6 million Syrian refugees, Ankara is determined to prevent any further influx of migrants from Syria.
Turkey opened its western borders on Friday to let migrants reach Europe, in an apparent move to demand EU support in Syria by repudiating a 2016 agreement to shut the frontier.
The European Union's chief executive, Ursula von der Leyen, expressed sympathy with Turkey over the conflict in Syria, but said sending migrants to Europe cannot be the answer.
Turkey had shut the border in return for EU funds under a 2016 deal to end a crisis in which more than a million people entered Europe and 4,000 drowned in the Aegean Sea. On Monday, a child died after being pulled from the sea when a boat capsized off the Greek island of Lesbos, Greek officials said, the first reported fatality since Turkey re-opened its border last week.
Two Turkish security sources told Reuters a Syrian migrant also died from injuries on Monday after Greek security forces acted to stop migrants entering Greece by land. Athens denied the incident.

More than 1,000 migrants have arrived by sea on Greek islands since Sunday and more than 10,000 have attempted to cross by land at the border, where guards from both sides have fired tear gas into crowds caught in no-man's land.

Last year, Mexico's government extradited 58 people wanted in the United States, according to figures from the attorney general's office seen by Reuters. By Feb. 21, Mexico had already sent 30 people across the border in 2020, the figures showed.
""Mexico has reiterated the need to implement a new approach to reduce the access to weapons and the financing capabilities of criminal organizations that operate in our country as a result of the exorbitant profits resulting from drug trafficking into a restricted market, and with very large arsenals that are mostly, around 70% trafficked from the U.S.,"" Mexico's foreign ministry told Reuters.
""The Mexican government has expressed its willingness to cooperate with the United States under the aforementioned understanding that the security of the region is a shared responsibility,"" the ministry said, adding the extraditions comply with Mexico's legal framework and respond to the national interest.
The latest extraditee was Ramon Villarreal, aka ""El Mon"", a senior figure in the Beltran Leyva Cartel, who was flown out at the weekend to be tried in Texas for the murder of a lawyer of incarcerated former Gulf Cartel boss Osiel Cardenas.
Based in northwest Mexico, the Beltran Leyva Cartel was once allied to the Sinaloa Cartel of kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, now in a U.S. prison. The two gangs later became bitter enemies.
U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed Mexico to increase cooperation in the fight against drug gangs, especially since the massacre of nine U.S-Mexican women and children in northern Mexico by suspected cartel hitmen last November.
Early this year, Mexico drafted a judicial reform including measures that would have made it harder for lawyers to delay extraditions of clients to the United States. That draft bill met with heavy criticism from the opposition and civil society groups, and a far less radical reform proposal was ultimately put forward.
In 2017, Mexico extradited 57 people to the United States and 69 the following year, official data show.

Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving leader, responded to the projections by tweeting ""Thank you"" and a heart emoji. He fought Israel's third election in less than a year under the cloud of corruption charges, which he denies.
The four-term prime minister, who heads the right-wing Likud party, had failed to secure a governing majority in the legislature in elections held in April and September.
Opinion polls in the final days of campaigning had predicted further deadlock. But polls broadcast by Israel's three main television channels after voting ended showed Likud pulling ahead of the centrist Blue and White party led by former general Benny Gantz.
All three exit polls gave Likud and like-minded parties 60 of parliament's 120-seats, just one short of a majority. During the campaign, right-wing and religious parties had pledged to join a Likud-led coalition government.
Actual results, which have differed in the past from exit polls, will be released on Tuesday."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices appeared sympathetic on Monday toward a bid by President Donald Trump's administration to buttress its power to quickly deport illegal immigrants without court interference in a politically charged election-year case concerning one of Trump's signature issues. 
The justices heard arguments in the administration's appeal of a lower court ruling that a Sri Lankan asylum seeker - a farmer named Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam - had a right under the U.S. Constitution to have his case reviewed by a federal court. 
Conservative justices signaled support for the administration. Liberal justices appeared to back Thuraissigiam. The court has a 5-4 conservative majority including two justices appointed by Trump. 
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year concluded that in Thuraissigiam's case a federal law that largely stripped the power of courts to review quick deportations - known as expedited removal - violated a provision of the Constitution called the suspension clause.
Trump's administration contended the lower court's ruling would defeat the purpose of quick deportation and ""impose a severe burden on the immigration system."" Trump's hardline policies on immigration and deportation have been a centerpiece of his presidency and his bid for re-election on Nov. 3.
The American Civil Liberties Union, representing Thuraissigiam, said the administration's arguments, if accepted by the court, could be used to deport millions of other illegal immigrants without meaningful judicial review.
Thuraissigiam has said that as a member of Sri Lanka's Tamil minority he was tortured over his political ties and subjected to beatings and simulated drowning.
'CREDIBLE FEAR'
He fled Sri Lanka in 2016 and was arrested in 2017 just north of the U.S. border between San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Mexico. He was placed on track for expedited removal, a system dating back to 1996 that makes an exception for immigrants who can establish a ""credible fear"" of persecution or torture in their home country.
Officials rejected Thuraissigiam's claim of credible fear, short-circuiting the asylum process. He sought a federal court's review of what he contended were procedural errors and an incorrect legal standard used to assess his asylum bid.
A judge threw out his case. Under immigration law, courts have jurisdiction only to ensure that the government is not deporting the wrong person. However, the 9th Circuit ruled that under the Constitution's suspension clause - relating to a person's ability to challenge confinement by the government - courts must have the power to review Thuraissigiam's claims.
Conservative justices suggested that judicial review did not apply to Thuraissigiam's circumstances. Chief Justice John Roberts said that ""humanitarian release"" is not the same as what the Constitution protects. Justice Samuel Alito called Thuraissigiam's demands ""far reaching.""
Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said the purpose of judicial review has always been to ensure that a government officer has acted lawfully.
The administration has said immigrants seeking admission do not have any constitutional rights and that the Constitution has historically never required access to the type of court review Thuraissigiam seeks.
Since 2004, the federal government has applied expedited removal to illegal immigrants encountered within 100 miles (160 km) of the border and who had been in the country two weeks or less. Trump's administration has sought to greatly expand the program but has been blocked by a federal judge. 

The justices also heard a separate case challenging similar restrictions on federal appeals courts to review deportations of non-citizens who have committed criminal offenses, if their claims that they would be tortured if returned to their home countries have been rejected.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - During a testy hearing on Monday, a federal judge set a deadline for a Russian company facing criminal charges related to Moscow's interference in the 2016 U.S. election to explain why it had not handed over documents sought by prosecutors, a step that may lead to it being held in civil contempt.
Concord Management and Consulting LLC is due to go on trial next month after being charged in 2018 with conspiracy to defraud the United States for its role in election meddling aimed at sowing discord in the United States, helping President Donald Trump and harming his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich said there is a ""strong likelihood"" that the St. Petersburg-based company had failed to comply with a prosecution subpoena to hand over corporate documents, meaning it could be held in civil contempt and face fines.
Prosecutors have accused Concord of funding a so-called troll farm engaged in a propaganda campaign during the 2016 race. They have said Concord is controlled by a businessman named Evgeny Prigozhin with ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
During a tense exchange with the company's attorney Eric Dubelier, Friedrich ordered Concord to submit a sworn statement from a company representative by 5 p.m. (2200 GMT) on Wednesday explaining the steps it took to search for corporate financial records and internet IP addresses sought by prosecutors.
""I find it implausible that Concord cannot indicate the IP address for a four-year period,"" Friedrich said, prompting Dubelier to accuse her of already reaching a conclusion.
""We just come here and we sit here and you read a pre-determined order,"" Dubelier said.
The case stems from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that documented Russian election interference. Concord's corporate officers have never set foot in the U.S. courtroom and are not expected to do so. Russia does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. 
Prior efforts between the prosecution and Concord's defense lawyers to arrange for its officials to travel to the United States to review the evidence and prepare for the trial have failed, according to prosecutor Adam Jed.
Dubelier said Concord had complied with the subpoena and produced all the records it possesses. 
""He has no basis to allege that Concord is not participating in the process,"" Dubelier said of Jed's comments. ""It's bogus.""
Dubelier said he was authorized to provide more details to the court about Concord's search for records, but he had to provide it in a way in which the prosecution would not be privy to the disclosure. Dubelier was unable to name a person from the company, however, who could address how the search was conducted.
""I want an explanation, and I want it from Concord,"" Friedrich said. 

""There's an assumption in the tone you use with me ... that I'm doing something sneaky or wrong,"" Dubelier said. ""And I'm not. I'm not.""

37,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>","Klobuchar, Buttigieg to back Biden at rally in Super Tuesday state of Texas","By Trevor Hunnicutt and Jarrett Renshaw
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Former Vice President Joe Biden's Democratic presidential bid picked up steam on Monday as he was set to pick up the endorsements of two former 2020 rivals: Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg.
Klobuchar, a U.S. senator from Minnesota, will become the third 2020 candidate in as many days to drop out of the race when she announces the suspension of her campaign in Dallas, where she will also publicly back Biden, a Klobuchar aide said.
Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Buttigieg, who ended his White House bid on Sunday, also plans to endorse Biden in Dallas, a top adviser said. 
Biden is fresh off a resounding victory in Saturday's South Carolina primary and aiming for a strong showing on Super Tuesday against U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, the national front-runner and a democratic socialist from Vermont.
The Super Tuesday contests offer the biggest one-day haul of the 1,991 delegates needed to win the party's nomination at its national convention in July, with about 1,357 delegates, or nearly one-third of the total number, up for grabs. 
Fourteen states - California, Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Vermont, Colorado, Utah, North Carolina and Maine - as well as American Samoa and Democrats living abroad cast ballots on Tuesday. (The primary for expatriate Americans is scheduled to run through March 10.)
Billionaire former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg will make his ballot-box debut, betting that the hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money he has poured into his campaign will allow him to make up for not competing in the first four early-voting states.
Five candidates - Biden, Bloomberg, Sanders, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii - remain for the nomination to take on Republican President Donald Trump in November's election, down from more than 20 earlier in the race.
Bloomberg and Biden have emerged as the main contenders for the votes of moderate Democrats while Sanders is the progressive front-runner nationally.
BIDEN'S MOMENTUM
Biden's high-stakes triumph in South Carolina, where his campaign had said his popularity with black voters would propel him to victory after early disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, helped winnow the field.
In addition to Klobuchar and Buttigieg, billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer also gave up his campaign on Saturday night after a third-place finish in the Southern (NYSE:SO) state in which he had invested most heavily.
But it was not immediately clear who would immediately benefit from their departures. A Morning Consult poll taken Feb. 23-27, for example, before Buttigieg exited the race, showed that 21% of his supporters named Sanders as their second choice, 19% picked Biden, another 19% chose Warren and 17% favored Bloomberg.
Biden still lags his rivals in spending and organization in Super Tuesday states and beyond, but his campaign said on Sunday it had raised more than $10 million over the preceding two days.
Biden's campaign has also touted endorsements from more than 70 elected officials and community leaders since South Carolina's primary that could lead to a boost in attention for Biden ahead of Super Tuesday.

In Virginia, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine has endorsed him, along with state House Majority Leader Charniele Herring. In Colorado, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock has backed Biden. In California, U.S. Representative Gil Cisneros is supporting the former vice president.

A Feb. 25-29 survey of 1,200 adults by newspaper Reforma showed President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's approval rating fell by 19 percentage points to 59% over the past year, the latest poll pointing to his waning appeal.
Buttressed by soaring popular support, Lopez Obrador took office in December 2018 vowing to root out corruption, lift the economy and reduce record levels of violence.
Since then, homicides have broken new records and the economy has tipped into a mild recession, chipping away at backing for the veteran leftist, who has sought to blame previous governments for Mexico's problems.
The Reforma poll showed 88% of respondents favored opening a corruption probe against Pena Nieto. He has always denied any wrongdoing, but his government was seriously tainted by graft allegations by the time he left office.
One of Pena Nieto's erstwhile top aides, Emilio Lozoya, a former boss of state oil firm Pemex, is wanted in Mexico on corruption charges.
Lozoya was arrested in Spain last month, and media reports suggest other senior figures from the Pena Nieto administration are in the sights of Lopez Obrador's investigators.
Lopez Obrador has said he is not personally in favor of pursuing former presidents in court because he does not want to rake through the past. But he regularly accuses his predecessors of being complicit in state-sponsored corruption.
And if enough people sign a petition to trigger a referendum on whether former presidents should be prosecuted, Lopez Obrador says they should be heard.
The Reforma poll showed the government's record on violent crime has been particularly damaging to Lopez Obrador. Some 47% of respondents said public security had worsened in the past year, with only 21% taking the opposite view.
Public discontent intensified in recent weeks after a string of highly publicized slayings of women and girls. They included the death of a young woman mutilated by her partner, and the murder of a 7-year-old girl.
A separate survey by polling firm Consulta Mitofsky showed that over the past month Lopez Obrador's approval rating among women slipped nearly 3 percentage points to 52.7%. That compared with a drop of 0.6 points to 59.2% among men."

The Civil Protection Agency said on Monday the total number of confirmed cases in Italy had jumped to 2,036 from the 1,694 reported on Sunday. Fifty-two have died.
As Italy struggles to contain Europe's worst outbreak of the influenza-like disease, the government has placed some 50,000 people in 11 towns under quarantine.
One of those is Marzio Toniolo, a 35-year-old teacher who uses his mobile phone to send Reuters daily accounts and videos of life in the red zone. 
A presenter on Radio Sange, an internet-based station that provides some distraction from boredom for the trapped residents, asks listeners: ""Which red zone is the coolest?""
""Who wins between Casale and Codogno?"" another says.
The 11th day of Toniolo's video and picture diary shows that some of San Fiorano's shops are starting to reopen, although they have to abide by strict safety rules.
""You must wear gloves and a (protective) mask at all times, and only two people may enter at a time,"" say two notices fixed to a shop window.
But behind closed doors and in the evenings, things are a little different.
In Toniolo's house, the family gets together to make ravioli with grandmother Ines Prandini, 85. When the job is done, they clink glasses.
At night, other groups of people meet to eat together in the open air, or at a bus stop. Everyone brings something different: cheese, bread or wine. An impromptu street party takes place with no one wearing masks.
Toniolo says many inhabitants worry about how they will be viewed once their quarantine is over.

""There is a fear that there could be 'racist' feelings towards the inhabitants who come from these zones,"" he says.

The motion to honor Lula was backed by the city's Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo.
""Immense joy to give the Honorary Citizen title to Lula. Paris will always stand beside those whose rights are not respected,"" Hidalgo said on Twitter.
Brazil has turned its back on democracy since the election of Bolsonaro, Hidalgo told Lula at a ceremony, which was also attended by former President Dilma Rousseff.
Lula has attacked Bolsonaro, a right-winger, for impoverishing working Brazilians and vowed to unite the left to win the 2022 elections.
President from 2003 to 2010, Lula was imprisoned in 2018 after being found guilty of receiving bribes from construction companies in return for public contracts.
Lula has maintained his innocence and was freed in Nov. 2019 after Brazil's Supreme Court issued a broader ruling ending the mandatory imprisonment of convicted criminals after they lose their first appeal.
Franco-Brazilian relationships have deteriorated since last year when President Emmanuel Macron was embroiled in a war of words with Bolsonaro.
Macron accused Bolsonaro of lying to world leaders about Brazil's commitment to preserving the environment when forest fires erupted in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) region.
Bolsonaro at one point insulted Macron's wife and said he would only accept $20 million in aid offered by the G7 group of wealthy nations if Macron withdrew his ""insults""."

IDLIB, Syria (Reuters) - At a maternity hospital in northwest Syria, an alarm flashes at the main entrance to alert staff. It’s not patients en route to the hospital. It’s warplanes.
Doctors at the hospital face a daily struggle to care for expectant mothers amid a Syrian government assault that has driven deep into Idlib province in an attempt to snuff out the last stronghold of rebels battling President Bashar al-Assad. Medical staff said there had been a marked rise in miscarriages and premature births in the last two months. Some expectant mothers arrive in shock after leaving home in terror at the bombardment, and every day four or five babies are found to have died in the womb, one doctor told Reuters.
""For me, the latest stage has been the toughest of all,"" said the doctor, 37-year old Ikram who is eight months pregnant. 
Speaking Thursday in a small ward filled with a dozen tiny babies in incubators, she said the last hospital she worked in had been hit in an air strike. She said so too had her father-in-law’s house and that a rocket had landed unexploded next to the kindergarten her two young children – aged 3 and 4 - usually attend.
Minutes after she spoke the hospital’s alarm went off. An amber light flashed warning of an aircraft approaching and a red light signaled danger of a direct strike.
While the maternity center was spared, an intensification of air strikes and shelling in northwest Syria has caused the biggest single displacement of Syrians of the 9-year conflict, in which hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed. 
Nearly a million people – more than half of those children – have been uprooted since December as they have fled the destruction of their towns and villages, resulting in what the United Nations has said could be the worst humanitarian crisis of the conflict. Traumatized by war and with many uprooted several times already by fighting, they are now crowded into a shrinking pocket of land between Syrian government forces advancing from the south and east and the walled-off Turkish border to the north.
The Russian-backed Syrian government has been trying in recent months to retake Idlib province, a region that stretches around 100km (60 miles) into Syria from its northernmost point on the Turkish border. It says it is fighting to clear terrorist groups including al Qaeda from its land and has pledged to retake “every inch” of Syria. Turkey, which has said it can’t cope with the number of people fleeing the war, is supporting rebel forces fighting against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 130 civilians, including at least 44 children were, were killed during February alone, with dozens of hospitals and schools among facilities affected by the strikes, according to the United Nations.
Fighting has escalated sharply in recent days, bringing Turkey – a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization – and Russia closer to direct confrontation in Syria. Turkey launched a counter offensive against Russian-backed Syrian government forces in the region after 33 Turkish troops were killed in Syrian air strikes in Idlib last week. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan says he hopes to achieve a ceasefire in Syria’s Idlib in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week. On the battlefield, however, both sides have doubled down.
Ikram, who requested her last name not be published due to security concerns, qualified ten years ago just before the uprising started in 2011. She decided to stay in Syria, even as other doctors left. She worked in the town of Maarat al Numan, where there had been a shortage of doctors, and then moved to a hospital in her hometown of Idlib city. “I wanted to do what I can,” said Ikram, becoming visibly emotional. 
The maternity hospital she currently works at has been open about five years, she said, adding she’s is one of only three doctors left working there.
At Idlib city’s central hospital, a missile smashed into the road outside last week, leaving a large crater. The strike – which wounded four medical staff and damaged hospital rooms and employee living quarters– was the third near miss in recent months, said surgeon Mohammad Abrash, speaking Friday in a room overlooking still-visible crater outside. 
He said medical staff were at the front lines of treating people but that they were overloaded, and medication and medical equipment were in short supply and there were no replacements. 
“It’s so difficult for us to work under these conditions,” added 58-year old Abrash, from the nearby town of Saraqeb, before rushing to a basement operating theater to treat an injured man bleeding from wounds to his abdomen.
TRAPPED IN A WARZONE
For the roughly 3 million Syrians packed into Idlib province, crossing the Turkish border to safety is a distant dream.
Hundreds of thousands are sheltered in camps within sight of the concrete border wall which marks the frontier, battling freezing temperatures in recent weeks during which up to ten children died, according to the United Nations. 
Along the 30 km (20 mile) road from the border to Idlib city, more settlements are pitched across olive groves and ochre mud fields or perched on rocky outcrops. Some date back to the early years of the war and are now small towns of solid breeze-block dwellings. But others have sprung up in the last two months.
In one camp established in January to absorb the most recently displaced, there are communal tents housing 20 to 40 families each as well as smaller tents, according to camp administrators.
“We came to this camp to shelter from the winter,” said 55-year-old Mamdouh al Darfil, seated outside a 3 meter by 3 meter tent he and some of his family members share at the site, near the town of Maarat Misrin, north of Idlib city. He said he and his nine children had been displaced six times in the course of the conflict. 
They first moved into houses abandoned by other families, and then resorted to seeking shelter in tent camps. He and his two married sons now share three tents between them, but he described life there as bare subsistence, with no heating and little health care.    
“THEY BOMB AND SCATTER US”
With nowhere else to go, some 270 families have taken refuge at a sports stadium in Idlib city, many living in tents pitched under the concrete terraces, where smoke from fires kindled for warmth mixes with the stench of sewage.
Some families at the stadium are from as far away as the former rebel strongholds in eastern Damascus, 270 km (170 miles) to the south, from where they were displaced years ago. Many have been uprooted several times by the Syrian forces steadily advancing since 2015, when Russia intervened to support Assad, turning the war decisively in his favor.
That includes 38-year old furniture maker Ragheed al-Masri and his four children who were evacuated three years ago from their hometown of Saqba, east of the capital, to Hama province. He said before being evacuated conditions in his once rebel-held hometown had become unbearable, with a blockade by government forces leaving it difficult to get even a kilo of rice.
After leaving Saqba, they had moved north to the town of Maarat al Numan, where they stayed until it was captured by government forces in January. Now, their home is a tent erected outside the sports stadium.
During a visit Thursday, children played among the tents, laundry hung along a fence inside the stadium, and workers unloaded sacks of food from a lorry. Painted on the walls of the stadium, in the northwest of the city which has been under rebel control for five years, are religious slogans reflecting the Islamist agenda of insurgent groups that hold sway in much of the province.
Twenty-year old Shaza Deek said she and her parents and siblings arrived about a week ago. She said her family had been forced to flee their village of Kafr Ruma, south of Idlib, late last year by the Russian-backed Syrian government offensive.
""They threw us from our houses into the cold. We went from house to house,"" she said. After sheltering in an Idlib mosque for three weeks, her family moved to the stadium. “They bomb and scatter us, and no one helps us,” she said, noting the exception of Turkey which she said had given aid and support for the rebels.

""I didn't expect things to reach this situation. In this revolution we lost everything... I wanted to be a doctor, to study. All our dreams are gone.”

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin has proposed amending the Russian constitution to spell out that marriage means a union between a man and a woman and nothing else, a senior politician was cited as saying on Monday by the RIA news agency.
Putin, who has aligned himself with the Russian Orthodox Church and sought to distance Russia from liberal Western values, has proposed a shake-up of Russia's political system that critics say may be designed to extend his grip on power after 2024, when he is due to leave the Kremlin.
He and his supporters see that overhaul as an opportunity to modify the constitution to enshrine what they see as Russia's core moral and geopolitical values for future generations. 
Putin on Monday submitted his constitutional proposals to parliament just before the deadline, RIA cited Pyotr Tolstoy, deputy chairman of the lower house, as saying.
""For me, the most important one is his proposal to enshrine in basic law the concept of marriage as a union between a man and a woman,"" Tolstoy added.
Putin said last month Russia would not legalize gay marriage as long as he was in the Kremlin. He said he would not let the traditional notion of a mother and father be subverted by what he called ""parent number 1"" and ""parent number 2"".

ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Four-and-a-half years ago the image of a drowned toddler washed up on a beach on the Turkish coast shocked the world and drew attention to the perilous journey many Syrians took to flee civil war and reach the shores of Greece.
On Monday, further north in the Aegean Sea, another child drowned off the island of Lesbos after a boat capsized, the first fatality since Turkey re-opened its border to let migrants reach Europe, a move that triggered fears of a new flow of arrivals.
The prospect of more Syrians risking their lives to escape brought back haunting memories for Abdullah Kurdi, father of three-year-old Aylan whose death at the height of the migrant crisis in 2015 brought home its human toll.
""The whole world saw this image (of Aylan) and Europe opened its doors to refugees, but unfortunately it was for a very short time, maybe a couple of months,"" Kurdi told Reuters, speaking in the northern Iraqi city of Erbil where he now lives.
One photograph of his son showed the little boy wearing a bright red t-shirt and blue shorts lying face-down in the surf on a beach near the resort town of Bodrum. In a second image, a grim-faced policeman carried the body away.
""Then they closed the doors again,"" said 44-year-old Abdullah, a Syrian barber of Kurdish origin who now lives in a part of Iraq populated mainly by his ethnic kin.
""I hope God will open their hearts once again,"" he said, his voice breaking with emotion as he recalled the final journey of Aylan, his five-year-old brother and Abdullah's wife, who all drowned in the crossing.
""I hope the world opens its doors to those in need."" 
The flow of migrants subsided after a deal between Ankara and the European Union, under which Turkey agreed to take in many refugees from Syria. It now hosts around 3.6 million of them.
But renewed fighting in northern Syria means a million more people are on its doorstep trying to get to safety, and Turkey has told the world it can't take any more.

Ankara last week opened its border to Europe and more than 10,000 migrants, mostly from Syria, have reached Turkey's land borders with Greece and Bulgaria.

Governor Nasiru El-rufai said the gunmen are suspected to have come from the neighboring states of Katsina, Zamfara and Niger Republic, adding that troops had been sent to the area.
Hundreds of people have been killed in the northwest of Nigeria since last year, in attacks the government attributes to bandits - a loose term for gangs of outlaws carrying out robberies and kidnappings.

The ministry said on its official Twitter account that the individual, who is in quarantine in hospital, had not disclosed his visit to Iran when entering Saudi Arabia.
Iran has reported the most deaths from the coronavirus outside China, where the flu-like disease originated. Other Gulf Arab states have diagnosed the infection in several people who had visited Iran.
The official Saudi Press Agency, citing the Health Ministry, said people who had interacted with the infected man had been isolated and were being tested.
Saudi Arabia had since last week taken several measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the kingdom.
It imposed a ban on foreigners arriving for the Muslim umrah pilgrimage, Gulf Arab citizens visiting Mecca and Medina, home to Islam's two holiest sites, and tourists from at least 25 states where the virus has been found.
The Health Ministry said on Sunday it had prepared 25 hospitals to handle any coronavirus infections, with 2,200 beds dedicated for quarantine cases.
Pilgrimage is big business for Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, and is the backbone of plans to expand visitor numbers under an ambitious economic reform agenda.
The minor umrah pilgrimage, which can take place at any time of the year, brought 7.5 million people to Saudi Arabia in 2019, according to official figures.
Visits by pilgrims accelerate during the fasting month of Ramadan, beginning this year in late April. And in late July, some 2 million pilgrims are expected for the week-long haj, the world's largest annual gathering of Muslims, which has a separate visa regime."

Patel has rejected the allegations and Johnson has supported her, saying he has every confidence in her work.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's acting prime minister said on Monday he was standing down from most of his duties and called for early elections, one day after the man who had been designated to become premier withdrew his candidacy.
The decision by caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi deepened a power vacuum and further complicated Iraq's faltering efforts to deal with mass unrest, a reawakening Islamic State and a spreading coronavirus infection.
Abdul Mahdi, who was pushed out by protests but had stayed on temporarily, called on parliament to hold early elections on Dec. 4.
His designated successor, Mohammed Allawi, withdrew his candidacy on Sunday, accusing political parties of obstructing him.
Analysts fear Islamic State's ultra hardline militants could exploit the political paralysis of the oil producer's leadership, which has been unable to agree on a government after months of protests against the ruling elite.
The search is on for an alternative, but proposing the name of an establishment-backed candidate would spell more trouble.
Protesters who say the elite is corrupt and subservient to neighboring Iran had rejected even Allawi, and vowed on Monday to oppose any replacement lined up by the parties.
""We hope that the President will nominate an acceptable candidate whom everyone on the streets of Iraq can agree on,"" said a young man who gave his name as Mu'mmar at Baghdad's central Tahrir square.
""The Iraqi street is angry. The candidate should not come through the will of parties, the corrupt parties which we want to remove,"" he added.
He was standing next to other protesters, some wearing surgical masks to protect against both the coronavirus and the tear gas cannisters frequently launched by security forces.
STRUGGLE FOR INFLUENCE
A power vacuum could prove challenging for the region, given that a struggle for influence between the United States and its longtime foe Iran plays out regularly on the streets of Iraq.
Thousands of U.S. troops are stationed in the country in positions not far from those of Iran-allied Shi’ite militias.
Demonstrators began protests on Oct. 1, demanding the removal of all politicians, free elections and an end to economic mismanagement. Nearly 500 people have been killed in the unrest, with both security forces and unidentified gunmen shooting people dead.
The leaderless movement is an unprecedented challenge to Iraq's Shi'ite Muslim-dominated and largely Iran-backed ruling elite, which emerged after a U.S.-led invasion toppled Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003.
Allawi had been the man designated to lead Iraq out of the crisis. He was to replace Abdul Mahdi, but quit after majority Shi'ite and Sunni and Kurdish lawmakers failed to approve his cabinet.
Abdul Mahdi said on Monday he would take ""voluntary absence"" and not carry out most official duties. He asked for a deputy prime minister or minister to chair cabinet meetings.
According to the constitution, that would put President Barham Salih in charge as acting premier.
Analysts say Iraq's political parties and allied militias have prolonged the crisis by being unwilling to lose the funds and jobs provided by patronage - unfairness that galvanizes protesters angry about lack of services such as electricity.
""In Iraq the political parties are still governing the country even without formal posts and positions. Allawi's failure was obvious from the start,"" said Renad Mansour, director of the Iraq Initiative at Chatham House.
""ELITE PACT""
""The parties have considerable power over and stake in the system. They saw an existential threat and they came together,"" he added.
Hisham al-Hashimi, an analyst and expert on extremist groups, said Iraq was struggling to contain the coronavirus outbreak, which was spreading thanks to close ties with Iran, the country with most cases outside China.
""The state can also not deal with the economic crisis and the threat of a return of Islamic State,"" he said.
Islamic State, also known as Daesh, has started to regroup since the loss of its Mosul stronghold in 2017, driven by local Sunni complaints of neglect by Shi'ite-led authorities.
Under the constitution President Salih, a Kurd, has 15 days to designate a new candidate but this seems unlikely as parties remain divided on ethnic and sectarian lines.
Several names circulated on Monday with little prospect of success, among them the governor of Basra province, Asaad al-Eidani, who was touted before Allawi and rejected by protesters.
""Allawi was a sideshow and now we are back to where we were,"" said Mansour. ""He tried to go against parties and proved the parties call the shots, the next person will be someone the parties would want.""
Analysts said the constitution is undermined as parties continue to miss deadlines and ignore its provisions.
""The system is an elite pact of political parties making backroom deals,"" said Mansour, adding the parties ""don't mind working outside of constitution, it is there to make things look nice. But if it goes against their interest they have proven time and time again it's just piece of paper."""

One of the new cases was detected in the capital, New Delhi, while the other was in the southern state of Telangana, the government said in a statement.
The New Delhi patient had been in Italy and the one in Telangana had been Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the government said; both were stable and being closely monitored.
""The government is monitoring the situation at the highest-level,"" Health Minister Harsh Vardhan told a briefing in New Delhi.

PARIS (Reuters) - The Louvre museum in Paris shut its doors to art lovers and tourists for a second day on Monday after staff walked out over health risks associated with the coronavirus.
Queues quickly formed in the morning rain outside the world's most visited museum, home to Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo sculpture.
French law gives workers the 'droit de retraite' -- or 'right to withdraw' -- under legislation introduced by Socialist President Francois Mitterrand in the early 1980s, if they feel there is a clear and imminent danger to their safety.
At the Louvre, a large majority of some 300 workers voted in favor of the walkout unless the museum's management provided disinfectant gels and reinstated glass barriers between reception staff and visitors, Le Parisien reported.
A notice at the main entrance told visitors: ""We will inform you about a potential opening time as soon as possible.""
The French government has banned public gatherings of more than 5,000 people as it battles to contain an outbreak in France that has killed at least two people and infected more than 130.
The measure does not cover museums, tourist venues and theme parks and the Louvre's management said all necessary precautions were in place to ensure the museum could operate normally.
""It is not necessary to close the museum under the current circumstances,"" the Louvre's general administrator Maxence Langlois-Berthelot told reporters.
""We are putting into action all the measures which the authorities require of us.""
Disneyland Paris in Chessy, 32 kilometers (19.88 miles) east of central Paris, was open as normal on Monday, a representative said. The Eiffel Tower was also operating normally.
French labor law specialists warned that workers in other roles that involve close contact with the public - including public transport, hospitals, schools and supermarkets - might also invoke their right to walk out unless employers boosted protections against virus transmission.
""We are just at the start,"" said Stephane Beal, head of labor law at legal firm Fidal.
Two unions at the Paris bus and metro operator RATP said they were following the outbreak carefully.

ROME (Reuters) - A policeman and a fireman based in Rome have tested positive for the new coronavirus, authorities said, raising the risk of the virus spreading in the Italian capital.
Around 90% of the 1,694 cases reported in Italy to Sunday are concentrated in the wealthy northern regions of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna.
Cases in Rome, Italy's largest city with 3 million people, had so far been limited to a Chinese couple on holiday and an Italian repatriated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began late last year, on a special flight and hospitalized. All three recovered.
Authorities reported late on Sunday that a Rome policeman had tested positive. On Monday the Spallanzani infectious diseases hospital where he was staying announced that his wife, two children and sister-in-law were also infected.
A fireman living at barracks in the southeast of the city tested positive on Monday.
The school attended by the policeman's son, in the nearby town of Pomezia, was closed and lessons were suspended in the university faculty at Rome's main Sapienza university, attended by his other son.
On Monday, the local government in Lombardy said all its members would undergo tests after a councillor tested positive.
The national civil protection agency will give an update of cases at its daily briefing around 1700 GMT.
Italy, the European country worst affected by the outbreak, has recorded 34 deaths and seen economic sectors from manufacturing to tourism hit by a plunge in orders.
Several international airlines including Lufthansa Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) and countries such as the Czech Republic have reduced or suspended flights to Italian cities, including Milan.
WORK FROM HOME
Milan cathedral reopened to the public on Monday but schools and universities remain closed and many companies told staff to work from home.
The top of UniCredit skyscraper in Milan was lit in red, white and green, the colors of the Italian flag, in a sign of solidarity with people hit by the virus.
Lombardy's regional governor Attilio Fontana and the councillor responsible for welfare Giulio Gallera, the main public faces of the crisis management effort, are among those who will be tested.
Fontana has placed himself in voluntary partial quarantine after an assistant tested positive, isolating himself in a room in his office in the regional government headquarters, an Italian daily reported.
As the human toll grows, the government is increasingly worried about the economic outlook. Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri announced the cabinet would this week approve 3.6 billion euros ($3.5 billion) of measures to help companies.
An aid package worth 900 million euros was unveiled on Friday for the worst-impacted zones.
National statistics bureau ISTAT reported on Monday that the 2019 budget deficit came in at 1.6% of national output, the smallest fiscal gap for 12 years.

KABUL (Reuters) - Taliban militants will not take part in intra-Afghan talks until the Afghan government releases about 5,000 of their prisoners, spokesman said on Monday, presenting a major possible barrier to ending the war.
The statement came as a reduction of violence period came to an end, and the Taliban said a resumption of operations against Afghan government forces could now take place.
Under an accord between the United States and the Islamist Taliban signed on Saturday, the two sides are committed to working toward the release of combat and political prisoners as a confidence-building measure.
The agreement calls for up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners to be freed in exchange for up to 1,000 Afghan government captives by March 10. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, not involved in the talks, has rejected that demand.
""We are fully ready for the intra-Afghan talks, but we are waiting for the release of our 5,000 prisoners,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters by phone.
""If our 5,000 prisoners - 100 or 200 more or less does not matter - do not get released there will be no intra-Afghan talks."" 
The United States has said that after more than 18 years of war, it hopes negotiations toward a permanent political settlement and ceasefire can start in coming days, but Western diplomats and analysts see stark challenges ahead.
Ghani said on Sunday U.S. President Donald Trump had not asked for prisoner releases and that this issue should be tackled as part of a comprehensive peace deal. 
""The Afghan government has not made any commitment to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners before the start of any potential negotiation,"" Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for Ghani, said in response to the Taliban's statements on Monday.
A joint U.S.-Afghan government statement says the Kabul government will take part in discussions on the ""feasibility of releasing significant numbers of prisoners on both sides"" but does not mention the specific number or time frame.
U.S.-led forces ousted the hardline Islamist militants from power in 2001.
REDUCED-VIOLENCE PERIOD ENDS
Zabihullah said a deal on a reduction in violence in the seven days leading up to Saturday's pact had formally ended.
""As we are receiving reports that people are enjoying the reduction in violence, we don't want to spoil their happiness, but it does not mean that we will not take our normal military activities back to the level that we were before,"" he said.
""It could be any time, it could be after an hour, tonight, tomorrow or the day after.""
Two Taliban leaders who declined to be named said the group had initially decided to extend the reduction in violence period for two days beyond Saturday. At a meeting on Monday, the Taliban decided the arrangement would continue to apply to U.S. forces but would end for Afghan government forces, they said. 
A senior NATO defense source told Reuters that the reduction of violence period was indeed technically over, meaning technically the Taliban could attack Afghan forces. 
But U.S. General Scott Miller, commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, said that the United States expected the Taliban to ""be very serious"" about their obligations. 
""The reduction in violence was a confidence builder...The United States has been very clear about our expectations - the violence must remain low,"" he said in a tweet.
An explosion at a football field in Afghanistan's southeastern province of Khost killed at least three civilians and injured 11 on Monday, the interior ministry said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
The Afghan war has been in stalemate for more than 18 years, with Taliban forces controlling or contesting more territory yet unable to capture and hold major urban centers.

A full withdrawal of all U.S. and coalition forces would occur within 14 months, a joint statement said. The withdrawal depends on security guarantees by the Taliban.

Xi, speaking on a visit to several medicine institutes in Beijing, said strenuous efforts are needed to win the battle against the epidemic and that China must offer technological support to aid that campaign.
He also said bio security was an important part of national security, adding that China should set up national vaccine reserves to prepare for possible prevention work.
He emphasized that doing everything possible to save more patients' lives is a top priority.
Xi added that drug and medical equipment research and development and clinical treatment had to be strengthened to effectively improve the cure rate and reduce the mortality rate.
The virus emerged in Wuhan late last year and has since infected more than 86,500 people, with the majority in China, with most in Hubei. Mainland China's total number of confirmed cases is over 80,000 with a death toll at almost 3,000.
Xi added China will develop safe, effective vaccines, medicines and testing reagents to battle coronavirus as soon as possible. China needs to work to break through the bottlenecks of developing technical apparatus and independently develop high-end medical equipment, he said.
The country will stick to using a combination of western and traditional Chinese medicines in its battle, he said.
China will acquire core technology with independent intellectual property rights to come up with products and applications to safeguard people's health and lives in its fight against coronavirus, Xi added.
Xi said he attached great significance to mental health, for the patients who have recovered, for people who lost loved ones and for those separated from their family for a long time.
The virus, said to have originated in a wet market in Wuhan selling illegal wildlife, has led to China banning illegal trading and poaching of wild animals.
""We must resolve to put an end to the bad habits of eating wild animals and promote a civilized, healthy, green, and environmentally friendly lifestyle,"" Xi said."

GAROWE, Somalia (Reuters) - Fighting erupted in south Somalia on Monday between the national army and regional forces, amid deepening divisions that help Islamist insurgents and may exacerbate regional frictions.
Clashes broke out late morning between the Somali army, commanded by the federal government, and forces loyal to Jubbaland state leader Ahmed Madobe, residents in Jubbaland's Balad Hawo district told Reuters.
Jubbaland borders Kenya and is one of five semi-autonomous states in Somalia.
""I see two houses burning,"" shopkeeper Farah Abdullahi told Reuters from Balad Hawo, just over the border from the Kenya.
Fighters were using anti-aircraft guns and mortars, he said. ""Some residents have fled ... the whole town is dead. No business (is) open.""
Madobe is a trusted ally of Kenya, which helped build his forces and cement his rule, but is detested by neighboring Ethiopia, which has backed the central government.
Both Kenya and Ethiopia have troops in Somalia as part of an African Union-led peacekeeping force.
The AU peacekeepers, Somali federal government and local states are all supposed to be fighting the al Shabaab insurgency. Instead, some are fighting each other.
The United States warned last week the rivalries were distracting from the war on al Shabaab, which is linked to al Qaeda and has been battling central government since 2008.
Rashid Abdi, a senior analyst on Horn of Africa politics, warned the conflict also risked entangling Somalia's neighbors Ethiopia and Kenya. ""The Jubbaland situation can escalate very rapidly,"" he told Reuters. ""It is very likely that it can draw in external actors.""
Jubbaland information minister Abdi Hussein Sheikh Mohamed blamed national troops accompanied by Ethiopian troops for attacking Jubbaland forces.
""If the Somali government continues fighting the Somali states, then al Shabaab will get the chance to capture Somalia,"" Mohamed said.
Somalia's minister of information did not respond to calls seeking comment. The Ethiopian foreign ministry referred Reuters to the defense ministry, which did not return calls.
Some of Somalia's states accuse the government of meddling in local elections to entrench allies ahead of national polls scheduled for this year.
Jubbaland is particularly important - it borders both Kenya and Ethiopia and is the breadbasket of Somalia while its capital Kismayo is a strategically important port. Kenya helped Madobe oust al Shabaab from Kismayo in 2012.
Monday's fighting was the second clash between Somali federal and state forces in four days. Eleven people were killed on Thursday and Friday in fighting between Somali national forces and the Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama'a (ASWJ) militia, a group of moderate Sufi Muslims which pushed al Shabaab out of its territory."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rebuffed a bid by gun rights advocates to overturn President Donald Trump's ban on ""bump stocks"" - devices that enable semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like a machine gun - implemented after the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting.
The justices left in place a lower court's decision that upheld the Trump administration's action to define bump stocks as prohibited machine guns under U.S. law.
The ban, which went into effect in March 2019, was embraced by Trump following a massacre that killed 58 people at a music festival in Las Vegas in which the gunman used bump stocks. It represented a rare recent instance of gun control at the federal level in a country that has experienced a series of mass shootings. 
Numerous gun control proposals have been thwarted in the U.S. Congress, largely because of opposition by Republican lawmakers and the influential National Rifle Association gun rights lobby.
The Firearms Policy Foundation, a gun rights group, and other plaintiffs sued in federal court to try to reverse Trump's action. The Supreme Court last year refused to block the ban from going into effect while the legal challenges against it were considered in the courts. The justices also refused to temporarily exempt from the plaintiffs in the case from the ban. 
Bump stocks use a gun's recoil to bump its trigger, enabling a semiautomatic weapon to fire hundreds of rounds per minute, which can transform it into a machine gun. The ban required owners to turn in or destroy the attachments and those caught in possession of them could face up to 10 years in prison.
The Las Vegas gunman, Stephen Paddock, was found to have fired more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition in about 11 minutes, employing semi-automatic rifles modified with bump stocks.
The plaintiffs challenged a new rule issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives at Trump's direction that classified bump stock devices as forbidden machine guns under the 1934 National Firearms Act. 
A federal court refused to issue an injunction against the ban, saying the plaintiffs would likely lose the case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld that decision, deferring to the bureau's new interpretation of the National Firearms Act. 
Justice Neil Gorsuch, a conservative member of the court appointed by Trump, issued a statement agreeing with the decision to deny the appeal. But he criticized the lower court's deference to a federal agency - the bureau - that had changed its interpretation of a longstanding law.
""How, in all this, can ordinary citizens be expected to keep up?"" Gorsuch asked, adding that the bump stock dispute may return to the Supreme Court at a later date. 

The Supreme Court in December heard arguments in the first major gun dispute to come before the justices since 2010 - a challenge backed by the NRA to a handgun transport restriction in New York City.

GEORGETOWN (Reuters) - Guyanans were heading to the polls on Monday for an election that will decide who oversees an oil boom set to transform the poor South American country, which faces a test of whether it can sustainably manage a sudden influx of natural resource wealth.
Irfaan Ali, a 39-year-old former housing minister from the opposition People's Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (PPP), is seeking to unseat incumbent President David Granger, whose five-year tenure has coincided with the discovery of billions of barrels of crude offshore by a consortium led by  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).
While Ali has not threatened to renegotiate the terms of the country's contract with Exxon, members of his party have repeatedly slammed the deal signed under Granger - which includes a 2% royalty and 50% profit share after the consortium recovers its costs - as too generous to the U.S. company.
""They sold us out on the oil and gas sector,"" Bharrat Jagdeo, a former president and the PPP's current leader, told a rally of supporters on Saturday. ""Next week, when Irfaan Ali is the president, the oil companies will have to come back and talk about a fairer deal for Guyanese.""
Granger, a 74-year-old retired army brigadier, has argued his party would handle oil wealth more transparently, helping Guyana avoid the fate of other petro-states whose governments have wasted oil wealth on graft. His allies frequently bring up corruption scandals involving the PPP, which held the presidency from 1992 to 2015.
""The bulk of the money will go into the sovereign wealth fund, not into people's pockets,"" he said at a closing campaign rally in the capital Georgetown, adding that he would use oil money for infrastructure projects such as a bridge over the wide Essequibo River and a highway through the jungle toward the Brazil border.
While oil is set to provide a significant economic boon in the country of fewer than 800,000, the vote was likely to be marked by the same ethnic divisions that have dominated Guyanese politics since it attained independence from Britain in 1966.
Descendants of Indian laborers who came to work on the sugar plantations largely support the PPP, while the descendants of African slaves largely support Granger's APNU-AFC coalition.
Granger, who during his term underwent treatment for cancer that he says is now in remission, won by fewer than 5,000 votes in 2015, after taking over parliament in 2011 through a coalition with a smaller multiethnic party that won over many sugar and rice farmers.
But the closure of four sugar estates during his tenure, resulting in substantial job losses for Indo-Guyanese, could send those voters back to the PPP. Ali has said he would welcome back those who ""made a mistake in 2015.""
In past elections, it has taken the country three to five days to report official results."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian lawmakers pushed and shoved each other in parliament on Monday after opposition parties demanded the resignation of interior minister Amit Shah over the handling of deadly riots triggered by a citizenship law that excludes Muslims.
Police said on Monday that at least 41 people had died in two days of Hindu-Muslim clashes in New Delhi last week, the worst communal riots in the capital in decades.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party says the law, which grants refuge to non-Muslim minorities from across south Asia, is required to protect those groups from persecution. Critics say it is discriminatory and contravenes the spirit of India's secular constitution.
Hundreds of thousands of people - led by students and Muslim groups - have been demonstrating for more than two months, amid fears that the government will also launch a population register that could leave many Muslims stateless.
A week ago, a mob of several hundred people chanting Hindu nationalist slogans torched two mosques and dozens of Muslim houses, eyewitnesses said, while nearby houses carrying Hindu symbols were left untouched.
In parliament on Monday, opposition legislators shouted slogans and waved posters demanding that Shah, who controls Delhi's police and is an key ally of Modi's, step down.
In Shiv Vihar, a low-income area in northeast Delhi where some of the worst violence took place, hundreds of paramilitary police patrolled deserted lanes.
""There has been a big improvement in the situation,"" Delhi's chief of police S.N. Srivastava said while touring the area, littered with burnt-out vehicles and schoolbooks. ""The primary focus is to restore confidence among the people.""
But there was anger from those affected.
""The police took us to another area but didn't even ask how we were,"" said Mohammed Uddin, 70, whose home was burnt by the mob. ""I don't even have clothes."""

French President Emmanuel Macron, who blocked the opening of talks with Skopje and Tirana in October, said last month he was willing to allow them to begin membership talks if the European Commission gave them a positive review in March.
On releasing progress reports on Monday, Enlargement Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi said that the two countries had reformed their economies, judicial systems and other areas of state to prepare for meeting EU standards.
""The Commission stands firmly by its recommendations to open accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia,"" Varhelyi said in a statement. ""I hope that the member states will take a positive decision in the coming weeks.""
EU member governments are set to decide later this month. Approval would lead to a summit of EU leaders and all six western Balkan candidate countries - Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia and North Macedonia - in Zagreb in May.
It may go some way to assuaging concerns in the EU about growing Chinese and Russian influence in the six states and a sense that the bloc is failing to transform the countries scarred by the 1990s Balkan wars into market economies.
Macron had refused to approve the start of so-called accession negotiations at a summit in October, saying the process of admitting new members needed to change.
The Commission in February suggested reforms to the accession process along the lines of a French proposal made in November, giving EU governments more say and making it easier to stop or reset negotiations and freeze funds.

""The GNA (Government of National Accord) and its forces do not want to see Tripoli subject to shelling every day and it will move these forces (of Haftar) away from Tripoli,"" Fathi Bashagha said in an interview with Reuters late on Sunday.
Bombardment around the capital has intensified in recent days, and shelling has repeatedly closed the capital's only functioning airport at Mitiga, held by the GNA.
The escalation is the most serious since the announcement of a ceasefire on Jan. 12 and Bashagha said the GNA believed that Haftar had launched a new assault.

Haftar began his assault on Tripoli last year after advancing from his stronghold in eastern Libya with help from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia.
Turkey in January began sending some of its forces and allied Syrian fighters to support the GNA. Bashagha said this had ""created a military balance"" which should bring Haftar to dialogue.

Yells of ""it's a disgrace"" came from the public seating as the inquiry started hearing evidence on the refurbishment of the tower in the years leading up to the June 2017 blaze.
""What's the point if they (the witness statements) can't be used in a court of law?"" yelled one man as other members of the public remonstrated with him, asking him to let the hearing continue.
Grenfell Tower, a 23-storey social housing block owned by the wealthy borough of Kensington and Chelsea, was destroyed in the fire, which was the deadliest in a residential building in Britain since World War Two. 
The disaster shocked the nation, prompting an outpouring of grief, silent protest marches and a wave of soul-searching over whether neglect of an ethnically mixed, largely low-income community had played a part in the tower's fate.
The public inquiry is running in parallel with a separate police investigation which is considering charges including gross negligence manslaughter.
The public hearings, which started in September 2017, have established that a combustible cladding system fitted to the tower's external walls during the recent refurbishment was the main factor in the unstoppable spread of the fire.
The inquiry chairman, retired judge Martin Moore-Bick, swiftly suspended the hearing when the shouting started, then resumed it less than 10 minutes later after the protesters were ejected.
""People may feel strongly about some of the evidence, but it's very important ... that the witnesses are allowed to give their evidence with dignity,"" Moore-Bick said.
Another member of the public told the chairman that the protesters were not bereaved relatives or survivors of the fire.
The brief outburst stemmed from a decision to give some witnesses, mostly contractors involved in the refurbishment, a guarantee that nothing they told the inquiry could be used to prosecute them.
The witnesses had requested the guarantee days before they were due to appear in front of the inquiry in February, citing their right not to self-incriminate. The request caused a four-week delay while it was processed.
Attorney General Suella Braverman, the government's top legal adviser, confirmed last week that she was granting the witnesses the protection they had sought, on the basis that they would otherwise refuse to answer the inquiry's questions.
Braverman's undertaking does not amount to immunity. Charges could still be brought against the protected witnesses if supported by other evidence than what they tell the inquiry. They could also face charges if they were found to have lied to the inquiry.

GAPYEONG, South Korea (Reuters) - When the elderly leader of a South Korean religious sect knelt before the nation on Monday, he had hoped to defuse public anger over his church's role in spreading the coronavirus.
Yet Lee Man-hee's apology for the national ""calamity"" instead whipped up more outrage - due to a watch he was wearing.
The gold-colored watch, visible on his left wrist, was apparently given by disgraced former President Park Geun-hye, who was impeached and jailed in 2017 for corruption and abuse of power.
Images of the watch quickly trended on Twitter, while ""Lee Man-hee watch"" was the most searched phrase on South Korea's biggest search portal Naver.
""He is bragging about Park's gift,"" fumed one Twitter user.
""His watch was shiny and crystal clear, like his loyalty and ties with Park Geun-hye,"" jibed another.
There was no comment on the controversy from Lee. But a leader at his Shincheonji Church of Jesus said there was nothing untoward about the watch, which was given as a merit award.
""It has nothing to do with politics,"" the official told Reuters, noting that Lee, in his late 80s, was a veteran of the Korean War. ""He wears it because he doesn't have anything else.""
Lee, a self-proclaimed messiah, has been widely criticized for failing to do enough to stop the coronavirus after one of its members tested positive and infected many others.
South Korea has 4,335 cases and has seen 26 deaths.
""We did our best but were not able to stop the spread of the virus,"" Lee told a news conference, asking for forgiveness and bowing low twice in a sign of humility and regret.
The watch Lee wore did not appear an especially valuable one: similar models were being traded for 120,000-500,000 won ($100-$420) secondhand online.
In images from the news conference, the watch seems to have the presidential phoenix insignia and Park's signature inscribed

78,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 07:19AM ET</span>",Trial of Austrian army officer accused of spying for Russia opens,"SALZBURG, Austria (Reuters) - The trial of a retired Austrian army colonel accused of spying for Russia for decades opened on Monday and was ordered to be held behind closed doors on national security grounds.
The 71-year-old defendant, who has not been named, is accused of having provided ""comprehensive information"" on a range of military information to Moscow, above all on weapons systems and how tasks were assigned within the armed forces, prosecutors have said.
""He says no, at no point did he betray any military or state secrets,"" defense lawyer Michael Hofer told reporters before the trial in the city of Salzburg opened. Hofer said his client describes himself as a patriot.
After the defendant entered the court, wearing a suit and carrying a bundle of papers under his arm, the presiding judge ordered that the trial be held behind closed doors on national security grounds, and the public gallery was cleared.
Prosecutors say that in the course of his at least 25-year career as a spy for Russian GRU military intelligence, with which he first came into contact during a foreign assignment in 1987, he was paid hundreds of thousands of euros.
The case has been embarrassing for neutral Austria, which under conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has positioned itself as one of Russia's closest allies in the European Union while saying it wants to be a bridge between east and west.
Austria was in the minority of European Union states not to expel any Russian diplomats over the poisoning in Britain of Russian former spy-turned-British-mole Sergei Skripal and his daughter, which London blames on Moscow. Russia denies the accusation.
Asked about the nature of his client's relationship with a Russian military official who prosecutors say was his GRU handler, Hofer said: ""It developed out of an acquaintance, a friendship, a collegiality, that there was originally interest in how he sees the world.""
He added that his client gathered information for the Russian man, who had a ""language barrier"", apparently suggesting the Russian needed help understanding information in German.
""He (the defendant) says he felt more like a foreign correspondent,"" Hofer said.
His client faces up to 10 years in prison, according to a court statement. Five days in March have been set aside for the trial. It is unclear when a verdict will be reached."

80,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 06:39AM ET</span>",Brazil's cracked city leaves corporate heavyweights on the hook,"By Gram Slattery and Amanda Perobelli
MACEIO, Brazil (Reuters) - A sudden, violent tremor knocked José Rinaldo Januario to the floor of his kitchen one Saturday afternoon two years ago - a mystery given the Brazilian city of Maceio had little history of seismic activity.
After seven seconds or so, when the shaking stopped, the bar owner and his 21-year-old son Arthur raced out onto the street, fearing the house might collapse.
""It was like a volcano exploded,"" said Januario, 47.
Cracks in his home, which he had long assumed to be construction defects, widened in the months after the tremor in March 2018. His family was forced to abandon the house last year, part of an exodus of thousands of people being evacuated from the sweltering seaside city to keep them safe.
Last May, federal authorities identified a culprit: petrochemical giant Braskem. The authorities said nearby salt mines operated by the company threatened the structural integrity of more than 9,000 homes.
The saga, little known outside northeastern Brazil, has enraged many residents and officials in the state of Alagoas, the nation's second-poorest. It represents a serious financial risk for Braskem and its two largest investors, bankrupt construction group Odebrecht and state-run oil firm Petrobras, Latin America's biggest company.
Braskem believes the federal study that determined the reasons for the cracks in Maceio is methodologically flawed and inconclusive, and has commissioned studies of its own.
Nonetheless, in January the company announced a deal with prosecutors to provide 1.7 billion reais ($387.4 million) over two years to relocate and compensate 17,000 residents, though it did not admit blame for the damage. Its Brazil-listed shares shot up on investor hopes the accord would draw a line under a multi-billion-dollar question mark.
However seven state and federal prosecutors involved in the case told Reuters that the 1.7 billion reais - a cost estimate by Braskem - was a minimum initial payment and that the company may have to pay more out.
""That's a floor, not a ceiling,"" said Ricardo Melro, head of the Alagoas public defender's office, the most explicit public indication from officials that Braskem's compensation and relocation costs could exceed the figure flagged in January.
Melro said he believed the company would end up paying about 2.3 billion reais, about a third more.
In response to Reuters queries, Braskem representatives said they were confident in their estimate. The company has an extra 2 billion reais available in the unlikely event costs run over, they added.
Federal prosecutor Niedja Kaspary, however, said Braskem would also likely be required to compensate 23,000 other residents in adjacent neighborhoods as a result of a 6.7 billion reais federal lawsuit launched against the company last year.
Unlike the 17,000 people, those residents are not deemed in imminent danger, but authorities warn their homes could be vulnerable in coming years.
(Graphic: Braskem Disaster - https://graphics.reuters.com/BRAKSEM-DISASTER/0100B5H03VF/braskem-disaster.jpg)
""They're suffering losses because their homes are worth less, they're scared (of a collapse),"" Kaspary told Reuters. ""That gives them a right to compensation.""
All the prosecutors said Braskem would likely have to pay out a significant amount in that case, with Melro estimating close to 2 billion reais. A decision or potential settlement is not expected for at least several months, prosecutors say, while any appeal could take years.
Braskem has not formally provisioned for any potential costs related to that case as its outcome remains ""very uncertain,"" a representative said.
Petrobras, which owns 36.1% of Braskem, and Odebrecht, with a 38.3% stake, declined to comment.
EARTH HOLLOWED OUT
On the ground, the frustration among residents is palpable. Some said financial compensation was beside the point.
""So many people have had their homes here for so long. They've lived here for so long, and they have stories to tell,"" said Silvania Carmo Machado, 67, who moved 35 years ago into her hilltop house, which overlooks surrounding countryside.
While authorities want her to leave, and Braskem is set to offer 81,500 reais for her home, she has pledged to stay put.
Since the 1970s Braskem, Latin America's largest petrochemical producer and a household name in Brazil, has dug more than 30 salt wells in Maceio, many next to the Mundau lagoon, a scenic estuary popular with boaters.
The salt is pumped to a nearby Braskem plant, where it is transformed into chlorine-based products that eventually become PVC piping and other consumer goods.
Above ground, the mining operations are inconspicuous, with little more than a large metal tube above each well.
Yet slowly, authorities say, the mines have hollowed out a layer of the earth about 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) below the surface. As the ground has settled, they say cracks have emerged in homes in four neighborhoods that harbor everything from expensive apartment blocks to hillside shanty towns.
Januario, the bar owner, was among the many residents whose walls and ceilings had been cracking for several years. But the fissures were initially small and easily fixed. That changed with the 2018 tremor, which followed a heavy rainstorm a month before, residents told Reuters. The cracks began to expand, prompting local and federal authorities to investigate.
In May 2019, Brazil's federal geological survey issued a report, saying Braskem was to blame.
Ana Laura Sivieri, Braskem's marketing and communications chief, told Reuters there could potentially be other causes for the tremor and cracking, however, including water damage, the type of soil in the region or a geological fault.
""Outside those other causes, Braskem is singled out by the geological service as one of the principal causes. Braskem has raised doubts about this,"" she said.
'WE WANTED TO STAY'
Braskem, which has closed all its salt mines in Maceio, said it had not laid anyone off at its chlorine plant, where it has halted production. Its operations employ hundreds of people and account for 3% of the state's economic output.
During a Reuters visit to the plant, dozens of workers could be seen performing maintenance tasks such as raking leaves and cleaning the premises. Braskem is considering importing salt to allow it to restart production.
With billions of reais on the line, major shareholders are watching the situation in Maceio closely. In December, the then-CEO of Braskem was dismissed, partly because Petrobras was dissatisfied with how the company was dealing with the case, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
Braskem and Petrobras (Petroleo Brasileiro SA) declined to comment about the circumstances of the former CEO's dismissal. The former CEO, Fernando Musa, could not be reached for comment.
Braskem said it would execute the January deal with speed and compassion. It has hired dozens of professionals, from real estate agents to psychologists, to help those displaced.
For displaced residents like Januario, the wrench of leaving their homes is tough to overcome. Januario's family now lives 22 miles away in a nondescript district next to an airport.
He had to abandon his bar, and is now helping out at a transportation firm. His children have switched schools. His mother and wife have both been diagnosed with clinical anxiety and depression.
""We wanted to stay in our neighborhood,"" he said. ""That doesn't have a price."""
81,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 06:34AM ET</span>","Russia, Turkey may have carried out war crimes in Syria, U.N. says","By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - Russia killed civilians in air strikes in Syria and rebels allied to Turkey carried out murder and pillage in Kurdish areas, U.N. investigators said on Monday, actions it said could amount to war crimes by both Moscow and Ankara.
A report by a U.N. commission, covering the period from July, 2019 to Feb 2020, found that Russia conducted air strikes on a popular market and a camp for displaced people that killed dozens of civilians in July and August.
""In both incidents, the Russian Air Force did not direct the attacks at a specific military objective, amounting to the war crime of launching indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas,"" it said.
It also described abuses by rebels allied to Turkey during an assault on Kurdish-held areas, and said that if the rebels were acting under the control of Turkish military forces, those commanders may be liable for war crimes. 
The U.N. investigators, led by Paulo Pinheiro, called for ensuring accountability for a ""multitude of violations"".
The report blamed Russia for a strike in the city of Maarat al-Numan on July 22, when at least 43 civilians were killed. Two residential buildings and 25 shops were destroyed after at least two Russian planes left Hmeimim air base and circled the area.
Weeks later, an attack on the Haas compound for displaced killed at least 20 people, including eight women and six children, and injured 40 others, the report said.
""Based on the evidence available, including witness testimonies, video footage, data imagery as well as reports by flight spotters, flight communication intercepts and early warning observation reports, the Commission has reasonable grounds to believe that a Russian aircraft participated in each incident described above,"" it said.
The report also called on Turkey to investigate whether it carried out in an air strike on a civilian convoy near Ras al Ain that killed 11 people last October. Turkey has denied a role in the strike, which the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said was conducted by Turkish air craft.

A surge in fighting in northwest Syria has uprooted 1 million civilians since December. Turkey shot down two Syrian warplanes over Idlib on Sunday and struck a military airport well beyond its frontlines in a sharp escalation of its military operations following the death of dozens of Turkish soldiers last week.

82,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 05:49AM ET</span>",EU ministers to discuss coronavirus as concerns mount in Europe,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union ministers will discuss possible responses to the coronavirus outbreak in extraordinary meetings this week, a sign of growing concern over the epidemic's spread to most EU countries.
The spread of the virus raises questions over the EU economy and management of the European open-border Schengen area as well as causing health concerns.
Such a degree of activity in the EU has not been seen Europe's 2015-16 migration crisis and the 2009-12 financial turmoil in which several EU states were bailed out.
EU finance ministers will hold a conference call on Wednesday to ""coordinate national responses"" to the outbreak, Mario Centeno, head of the Eurogroup of countries that use the euro currency, tweeted last week.
EU finance ministers' have rarely held extraordinary talks since the Union overcame the worst phase of its debt crisis in 2012.
Centeno said the teleconference would be devoted to taking stock of the situation, before formal meetings already scheduled in two weeks' time.
The finance ministers' talks will precede an extraordinary meeting of EU health ministers in Brussels on Friday, the second this year to coordinate the reaction to the coronavirus.
Ministers from the 27 EU states agreed common measures to monitor and tackle cases of coronavirus in their territory at a meeting on Feb. 13.
Since then, the number of cases has spiraled in Italy, the third-largest country in the EU, and the number of cases has grown in other EU states.
Experts from EU countries agreed last week to meet on a weekly basis to assess the situation and coordinate possible measures to restrict travel within the Schengen area, which includes most EU countries.
They have decided so far not to re-introduce border checks at internal frontiers but will review that decision every week.
Checks could also be imposed temporarily because of concerns that there could be a new migration crisis, following the one of 2015-2016, after Turkey decided last week to stop patrolling its borders with Greece and Bulgaria.
An extraordinary meeting of EU migration ministers could also be held on Friday to discuss border management over both crises, one EU official said."
83,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 05:43AM ET</span>",Hong Kong police get protective upgrade to fight threat of 'local terrorism',"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong, grappling months of sometimes violent anti-government unrest, is to spend about HK$500 million ($64.3 million) on police protective equipment, including six armored vehicles, to help combat the threat of ""local terrorism"".
Police chief Chris Tang was speaking on Monday after the government announced in its budget last week that police funding would be HK$25.8 billion, up 25 percent from the previous year, drawing widespread criticism from pro-democracy activists.
About HK$300 million will be used to buy protective gear, and HK$200 million will be used for special equipment, including replacing six armored vehicles and buying more water cannon.
The figure includes a planned upgrade in protective gear of HK$10,000 for each of its 28,000 frontline officers.
Tang said he was concerned about a spike in the number of youths violating the law, two days after more than 100 people were arrested following a protest that turned violent.
""We have to beware of local terrorism. In the past nine months, we have discovered explosives in 11 incidents,"" Tang said at a press briefing.
""I think we have to face the reality that there is a new normal. The new normal is that things cannot go back to one year ago.""
Anti-government protests escalated in June last year, plunging the former British colony into its biggest crisis in decades and posing the gravest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.
The city had seen a relative lull in violence until black-clad protesters, some armed with petrol bombs, returned to the streets on Saturday in some of the worst clashes so far this year.
The weekend arrests took the total since June to more than 7,500, Tang said. Around 40% of those were students, of which 60% were from universities and 40% from secondary schools.
The number of arrestees under the age of 18 who committed criminal damage had jumped to 50% in January, up from 5% in June/July, he said.
""The situation of young people violating the law in relation to the anti-extradition bill is getting worse,"" Tang said, referring to the now-scrapped law that triggered the protest which have evolved into a broader democracy movement.
The government said last week it was adding more than 2,500 officers to the colony's 35,000-strong police workforce.
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland which the protesters say are being eroded by Communist Party rulers in Beijing. China denies meddling."

The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) report, which cited government documents and local media reports, identified a network of at least 27 factories in nine Chinese provinces where more than 80,000 Uighurs from the western region of Xinjiang have been transferred.
""Under conditions that strongly suggest forced labor, Uighurs are working in factories that are in the supply chains of at least 83 well-known global brands in the technology, clothing and automotive sectors, including Apple, BMW, Gap, Huawei,  Nike , Samsung (KS:005930), Sony and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),"" the think-tank said in the introduction to its report.
The ASPI report said the transfers of labor were part of a state-sponsored program. 
It says the workers ""lead a harsh, segregated life,"" are forbidden to practice religion, and are required to participate in mandarin language classes. 
It also says the Uighurs are tracked electronically and restricted from returning to Xinjiang. 
China's Foreign Ministry on Monday said reports the government had violated the Uighurs' rights were untrue. 
""This report is just following along with the U.S. anti-China forces that try to smear China's anti-terrorism measures in Xinjiang,"" spokesman Zhao Lijian at a regular press briefing on Monday.
The United Nations estimates over a million Muslim Uighurs have been detained in camps in Xinjiang over recent years as part of a wide-reaching campaign by Chinese officials to stamp out terrorism.
The mass detentions have provoked a backlash from rights groups and foreign governments, which say the arbitrary nature of the detentions violates human rights.
China has denied the camps violate the rights of Uighurs and say they are designed to stamp out terrorism and provide vocational skills. 
""Those studying in vocational centers have all graduated and are employed with the help of our government,"" said the Foreign Ministry's Zhao, ""They now live a happy life."" 
The 83 global brands mentioned in ASPI's report either work directly with the factories or source materials from the factories, it said, citing public supplier lists and the factories' own information.
One of the factories, O-Film Technology Co Ltd, which has manufactured cameras for Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) iPhones, received 700 Uighur laborers as part of the program in 2017, a local media article cited by the report said.
Apple referred Reuters to an earlier statement that said ""Apple is dedicated to ensuring that everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. We have not seen this report but we work closely with all our suppliers to ensure our high standards are upheld.""
The other companies mentioned in the introduction to ASPI's report - BMW (DE:BMWG), Gap Inc (N:GPS) , Huawei Technologies Co Ltd[HWT.UL], Nike Inc (N:NKE), Samsung (SAGR.UL) and Sony Corp (T:6758) did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. 
O-Film Technology did not respond to a request for a comment either. 
Volkswagen told Reuters in a statement that none of the listed companies is a direct supplier. It said the company holds ""direct authority"" in all parts of its business and ""respects minorities, employee representation and social and labor standards."" 
The report said a small number of the brands, including Abercrombie & Fitch Co (ANF.N), advised vendors to terminate their relationships with these companies in 2020, and others denied direct contractual relationships with the suppliers. 
ASPI describes itself as an independent think-tank whose core aim is to provide insight for the Australian government on matters of defense, security and strategic policy.

One by one, voters in face masks and gloves who have been isolated at home after crossing paths with coronavirus carriers filed through more than a dozen tents across the country to fill in their ballot slips in a close contest in which candidates are fighting for every last vote.
Election officials sat on the opposite side of a see-through plastic barrier to make sure things run smoothly.
Ten Israelis have tested positive for the virus and about 5,500 others, including those who have recently traveled to coronavirus hot spots, are under home quarantine, according to Israel's health ministry.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking re-election under the weight of an imminent corruption trial, with the country's third ballot in less than a year predicted to end in another deadlock.
Seeking to reassure voters over coronavirus fears, Israeli Health Minister Yaakov Litzman said he ""hopes it will not have any effect at all, because we did all of the things that we should have done"".
Watching from afar outside a dedicated polling station constructed at the back end of an empty parking lot in Jerusalem, voter Rene Oseasohn, who is not in quarantine, said the virus ""is a troubling feature but I don't think there is much we can do about it"". 

She said she was trying to keep her distance from other people and to not stay put in one place while hoping for the best.

China last month revoked the visas of three Wall Street Journal reporters in Beijing after the newspaper declined to apologize for a column with a headline calling China the ""real sick man of Asia"". Another reporter with the paper had to leave last year after China declined to renew his visa.
""Since 2013, when Xi Jinping's ascension to power was completed, China has forced out nine foreign journalists, either through outright expulsion or by non-renewal of visas. The FCCC fears that China is preparing to expel more journalists,"" the group said, citing responses from 114 reporters to a survey.
""Chinese authorities are using visas as weapons against the foreign press like never before, expanding their deployment of a long-time intimidation tactic as working conditions for foreign journalists in China markedly deteriorated in 2019,"" it said.
""What happened to the Wall Street Journal journalists was just an independent case,"" said Zhao Lijian, spokesman for China's foreign ministry. He said the FCCC report was ""inappropriate"" and that China does not recognize the organization. 
""There are over 600 foreign journalists stationed in China and they don't need to worry about their reporting in China as long as they observe Chinese laws and regulations,"" Zhao told a regular media briefing. 
Beijing has previously strongly denied accusations the government is limiting press freedoms for foreign reporters. It has also criticized foreign media coverage of issues like the treatment of minority Uighurs in Xinjiang, protests in Hong Kong and China's senior leadership, calling it biased.
The FCCC said that for a second year running, none of the respondents to the survey said reporting conditions in China had improved, with 82% saying they had experienced interference, harassment or violence while out reporting.
A quarter of respondents also said they had received visas of less than 12 months. China-based foreign reporters typically receive one-year visas and have to renew them annually.
""As China reaches new heights of economic influence, it has shown a growing willingness to use its considerable state power to suppress factual reporting that does not fit with the global image it seeks to present,"" the report said.
""As scrutiny is intensifying toward China, it is more important than ever for foreign media to have freedom to report and cover the country,"" the report added. 
""The ability for foreign journalists to be based in China without impediment is crucial for quality international news coverage about the country.""

The man that he shot was stable in hospital, he added.
The gunman, Archie Paray, later gave assurances that the hostages would be released without harm, provided that the authorities did not try to trick him.
He was sacked by the company that provides security for the mall and had tried to get other guards involved in what mayor Zamora said was ""some sort of coup d'etat against the mall management"".
Though major hostage incidents are rare in the Philippines, memories are fresh of when a sacked policeman hijacked a Manila bus full of Hong Kong tourists in 2010, and was killed in a gunfight together with eight passengers when police bungled a rescue.
A SWAT team was seen entering the four-storey V-Mall as shoppers were evacuated and crowds of media gathered behind a security cordon.
Among Paray's demands was the opportunity to speak to former colleagues and to media by video call. The negotiators agreed.
Late in the afternoon, a guard held up a smartphone to media during which the gunman panned his camera around the room to show that the hostages were alive. He declined to say how many he was holding.
""Just wait, they will come out alive,"" he said.

Mall staff later handed out a few radios to reporters to allow them to ask Paray questions.

89,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 05:08AM ET</span>",Malaysia's new PM takes office amid economic challenges,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Muhyiddin Yassin took office as Malaysia's new prime minister on Monday, capping a week of political chaos caused by the shock resignation of Mahathir Mohamad, and as the country's economy weakens mainly due to the spread of the coronavirus.
In a marked difference from the administration of his outspoken 94-year-old predecessor, the publicity-shy Muhyiddin, 72, made no public remarks to state media called for his first day in office.
His office issued a two-paragraph statement saying he met government officials but had no plans to see any political leaders. He also visited the graves of his parents in his hometown in Johor, neighboring Singapore, to pay his respects.
Muhyiddin, who unexpectedly fought off a challenge from his former boss Mahathir to get the top job, will have to soon hammer out deals with his new Malay nationalist alliance partners to pick his cabinet colleagues.
One of his biggest challenges would be to revive Southeast Asia's third biggest economy that grew at its slowest pace in a decade in the fourth quarter.
It was not immediately clear if he would stick to a $4.7 billion stimulus package announced by Mahathir last week as interim prime minister to counter the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Malaysia has reported 29 confirmed cases of infection, with 22 already cured and discharged.
""The change of government and assemblance of a new cabinet —appointments expected soon — could delay the roll out of the stimulus measures announced by Mahathir,"" said Peter Mumford of consultancy Eurasia Group.
""In addition, the deterioration in relations between Muhyiddin and Mahathir means there is a risk the former replaces the latter’s appointments at government-linked companies, creating a period of uncertainty that delays investment plans.""
Foreign investors dumped 1.26 billion ringgit ($300 million) worth of equities last week - the highest in 88 weeks - as domestic political uncertainty added to worries over the disease outbreak.
Muhyiddin also faces the possibility of sustained public protests, as supporters of his former political allies accused him of leading a coup to form a backdoor government.
Police said they are investigating whether participants at a rally on Sunday against Muhyiddin's premiership, who included Mahathir's eldest daughter Marina, had contravened a law on illegal assembly.

Police have so far arrested one man and are investigating three others for social media posts that insult the king and threaten public order.

The rocket struck the vehicle's front wheel around 0550 GMT on Monday, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on Twitter. He said ""the terrorists were followed and cornered"", but did not specify who the attackers were believed to be.
Shortly after, Turkish Trade Minister Rushar Pekcan said one of the customs agents had been killed in the attack.
The office of the governor of Agri province said the vehicle was hit in transit from the Dogubayazit border area to the Gurbulak border gate, causing it to skid off the road and flip over. In did not say who had carried out the attack.
The vehicle was near a parking lot for freight trucks, hospital and security sources said. Several ambulances, security teams and search and rescue personnel were sent to the area.
Some Turkish media reports said the attack was carried out by Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants, who have fought an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984. The PKK are active in southeast Turkey but less so in Agri.
Earlier this month, Turkey closed its land and air borders with Iran over an outbreak of the new coronavirus. On Friday, Iran announced nationwide school closures as the death toll from the outbreak rose to 34."

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea fired two short-range missiles off the east coast into the sea on Monday, resuming testing after a three-month pause, South Korea's military said.
The missiles were launched from the eastern coastal city of Wonsan and flew 240 km (149 miles) and reached 35 km in altitude, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. North Korea has launched a series of missiles from the area in the past. 
The North appears to be continuing a firing drill that leader Kim Jong Un oversaw last Friday, JCS said.
Monday's launch was the first since North Korea fired what it called ""super-large multiple rocket launchers"" on Nov. 28. 
South Korea's presidential Blue House said national security adviser Chung Eui-yong held an emergency video conference with ministers of related agencies to analyze the latest test.
""The ministers expressed strong concern over North Korea's resumption of short-range missile launches in three months,"" the Blue House said in a statement. ""Such actions are unhelpful for efforts to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula and they urged North Korea to stop them."" 
JCS said it is monitoring for potential additional launches.
South Korea and the United States indefinitely decided to postpone joint military drills amid a growing coronavirus outbreak in South Korea that has now infected soldiers from both countries.

South Korea on Monday reported 476 new coronavirus cases, taking its tally to 4,212.

MATAMOROS, Mexico (Reuters) - For a few precious hours, Luz thought she would soon see her children again.
The 42-year-old Peruvian is one of about 2,000 migrants, mostly seeking asylum in the United States, who are living in a sea of tents on the banks of the Rio Grande in Mexico, within view of the frontier fence.
On Friday afternoon, a U.S. court blocked the Trump administration's ""Remain in Mexico"" policy that has forced them to wait south of the border as their cases proceed. 
The policy is central to President Donald Trump's quest to reduce the number of people granted entry to the United States. If the ruling is upheld, it would be a blow to Trump, a Republican, as he runs for a second term in office, with hardline immigration policy central to his campaign.
As word of the court's ruling raced through the camp in the Mexican border town of Matamoros, few were more elated than mothers and fathers like Luz who have made the wrenching choice to send their children to cross into the United States alone. 
The ""Remain in Mexico"" program, also known as Migrant Protection Protocols, does not apply to unaccompanied minors, so some parents have sent their children hoping they can stay with relatives in the United States, rather than camping out for months in one of Mexico's most dangerous cities. 
When news of the ruling reached Luz, her eyes filled with tears. She envisioned a reunion with her 11-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son, whose faces she has only seen over video chat since they entered the United States nearly a month ago.
But hope dimmed quickly. Hours later, the court's decision was suspended to allow the government to ask the Supreme Court to take up the issue, leaving Luz and others with nothing but a new set of questions. 
“All I think of is being with my children,” said Luz, who said she left Peru due to domestic violence. “I need my children and my children need me.”
Desperation has pushed many parents to make the same choice, fearful of the poor sanitation and risk of kidnapping or worse if they stay in Matamoros. 
Luz knew her children couldn’t stay. Her daughter, who is disabled, struggled with life in the camp and would scream in frustration.
“I can live here, but my children couldn’t stand it,” said Luz, shielding her face from the sun with a white baseball cap embroidered with the letters ""USA.""
In early February, she sent her children across the bridge. Since then they have stayed in a U.S. government facility as Luz works to provide the necessary documentation so they can be released to a cousin.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
At least 50 unaccompanied minors made the same trip into the United States from Matamoros in 2019, local activists say, and the trend has continued this year. 
As Edixson Sanchez trekked from Venezuela to the United States, his seven-year-old son was always by his side. But shortly after the pair were returned to Matamoros, Sanchez, 39, saw the men who had kidnapped them earlier on their journey lurking near the camp. He sent his son to the bridge the next day. 
On Saturday, Sanchez called his son, now in the United States with his mother, listening helplessly as the boy cried.

Desperate to stop his son’s tears, Sanchez reassured him that he would join him soon, though he still has no idea when that day will come.

94,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2020 10:07PM ET</span>",Murder probe sought for South Korea sect at center of coronavirus outbreak,"SEOUL (Reuters) - The government of Seoul asked for a murder investigation into leaders of a Christian sect at the center of the country's deadly coronavirus outbreak, saying the church was liable for its refusal to cooperate with efforts to stop the disease.
A large majority of the more than 4,000 confirmed cases of the South Korean outbreak, the largest outside China and still growing, have been linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive movement that reveres founder Lee Man-hee.
Park Won-soon, mayor of the capital Seoul, said if Lee and other leaders of the church had cooperated, effective preventive measures could have saved those who later died of the virus.
""The situation is this serious and urgent, but where are the leaders of the Shincheonji, including Lee Man-hee, the chief director of this crisis?"" Park said in a post on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page late on Sunday.
Seoul's city government said in a separate statement that it had filed a criminal complaint with the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, asking for an investigation of Lee and 12 others on charges of murder and disease control act violations.
The prosecutors' office said it had received the complaint and was reviewing it.
Health authorities said the vast majority of the 3,000 cases confirmed in Daegu, another Korean city, were linked to a branch of the church there, where a person who had tested positive in February attended services twice.
Many have blamed the church's secretive nature and tightly packed conditions at services for the large number of cases linked to it.
An additional 600 cases were detected in the province surrounding Daegu.
South Korea's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported 476 new cases of the coronavirus on Monday, raising the total to 4,212 with 22 deaths.
The church issued a statement Sunday reiterating calls for an end to ""stigmatisation, hatred and slander"" against its followers, saying it was cooperating with the government.

Health authorities said they have obtained a list of 317,320 Shincheonji members and ""trainees"", but have been told by some local governments that it was not exhaustive.

95,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2020 08:39PM ET</span>","In Fukushima, Olympic torch relay faces cool welcome from nuclear evacuees","By Mari Saito and Kiyoshi Takenaka
FUTABA, Japan (Reuters) - Dressed in protective plastic coveralls and white booties, Yuji Onuma stood in front of the row of derelict buildings that included his house, and sighed as he surveyed his old neighborhood.
On the once-bustling main street, reddish weeds poked out of cracked pavements in front of abandoned shops with caved-in walls and crumbling roofs. Nearby, thousands of black plastic bags filled with irradiated soil were stacked in a former rice field.
""It's like visiting a graveyard,"" he said.
Onuma, 43, was back in his hometown of Futaba to check on his house, less than 4 kilometers from the Fukushima nuclear power plant, which suffered a triple meltdown in 2011 following an earthquake and tsunami, leaking radiation across the region.
The authorities say it will be two more years before evacuees can live here again, an eternity for people who have been in temporary housing for nine years. But given the lingering radiation here, Onuma says he has decided not to move back with his wife and two young sons.
Most of his neighbors have moved on, abandoning their houses and renting smaller apartments in nearby cities or settling elsewhere in Japan.
Given the problems Futaba still faces, many evacuees are chafing over the government's efforts to showcase the town as a shining example of Fukushima's reconstruction for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
While there has been speculation that the global spread of the coronavirus that emerged in China last month might force the cancellation of the Olympics, Japanese officials have said they are confident the Games will go ahead.
The Olympic torch relay will take place in Fukushima in late March - although possibly in shortened form as a result of the coronavirus, Olympic organizers say - and will pass through Futaba. In preparation, construction crews have been hard at work repairing streets and decontaminating the center of town.
""I wish they wouldn't hold the relay here,"" said Onuma. He pointed to workers repaving the road outside the train station, where the torch runners are likely to pass. ""Their number one aim is to show people how much we've recovered.""
He said he hoped that the torch relay would also pass through the overgrown and ghostly parts of the town, to convey everything that the 7,100 residents uprooted of Futaba lost as a result of the accident.
""I don't think people will understand anything by just seeing cleaned-up tracts of land.""
""UNDER CONTROL""
In 2013, when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was pitching Tokyo as the host of the 2020 Games to International Olympic Committee members, he declared that the situation at the Fukushima nuclear plant was ""under control"".
The Games have been billed as the ""Reconstruction Olympics"" - an opportunity to laud Japan's massive effort to rebuild the country's northeastern region, ravaged by the earthquake and tsunami, as well as the meltdowns at the nuclear plant owned by Tokyo Electric Power Co.
After the disaster, the government created a new ministry to handle reconstruction efforts and pledged 32 trillion yen ($286.8 billion) in funding to rebuild affected areas.
Signs of the reconstruction efforts are everywhere near the plant: new roads have been built, apartment blocks for evacuee families have sprouted up, and an imposing tsunami wall now runs along the coastline. An army of workers commutes to the wrecked plant every day to decommission the reactors.
In March, just days before the Olympic relay is scheduled to be held across Fukushima, Japan will partially ease a restriction order for Futaba, the last town that remains off-limits for residents to return.
This means that residents like Onuma will be able to freely come and go from the town without passing through security or changing into protective clothing. Evacuees will still not be able to stay in their homes overnight.
After a few years bouncing between relatives' homes and temporary apartments, Onuma decided to build a new house in Ibaraki, a nearby prefecture. His two sons are already enrolled in kindergarten and primary school there.
""You feel a sense of despair,"" said Onuma. ""Our whole life was here and we were just about to start our new life with our children.""
When Onuma was 12, he won a local competition to come up with a catchphrase promoting atomic energy. His words, ""Nuclear Energy for a Brighter Future"" was painted on an arch that welcomed visitors to Futaba.
After the nuclear meltdowns, the sign was removed against Onuma's objections.
""It feels like they're whitewashing the history of this town,"" said Onuma, who now installs solar panels for a living.
The organizing committee for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.
""BACK BURNER""
Other residents and community leaders in nearby towns say the Olympics may have actually hindered the region's recovery.
Yasushi Niitsuma, a 60-year-old restaurant owner in Namie, said the Olympics stalled local reconstruction projects because of surging demand and costs to secure workers and materials ahead of the games in Tokyo.
""We need to wait two years, three years to have a house built because of the lack of craftsmen,"" said Niitsuma. ""We are being put on the back burner.""
Fukushima's agriculture and fisheries industries have also been devastated.
""I was astonished by the ""under control"" comment made in a pitch to win the Olympic Games,"" said Takayuki Yanai, who directs a fisheries co-op in Iwaki, 50 kilometers south of the nuclear plant, referring to Abe's statement.
""People in Fukushima have the impression that reconstruction was used as a bait to win the Olympic Games.""
A government panel recently recommended discharging contaminated water held at the Fukushima plant to the sea, which Yanai expects to further hurt what remains of the area's fisheries industry.
At a recent news conference, Reconstruction Minister Kazunori Tanaka responded to a question from Reuters about criticism from Fukushima evacuees.
""We will work together with relevant prefectures, municipalities and various organizations so that people in the region can take a positive view,"" he said, referring to the Olympics.
Local officials also say they are making progress for the return of residents to Futaba.
""Unlike Chernobyl, we are aiming to go back and live there,"" Futaba Mayor Shirou Izawa said in an interview, calling the partial lifting of the evacuation order a sign of ""major progress"".
There were a lot of misunderstandings about the radiation levels in the town, including the safety of produce and fish from Fukushima, Izawa said.
""It would be great if such misunderstanding is dispelled even a little bit,"" he said.
Radiation readings in the air taken in February near Futaba's train station were around 0.28 microsieverts per hour, still approximately eight times the measurement taken on the same day in central Tokyo.
Another area in Futaba had a reading of 4.64 microsieverts per hour on the same day, meaning a person would reach the annual exposure upper limit of 1 millisievert, recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, in just nine days.
Despite the official assurances, it's hard to miss the signs of devastation and decay around town.
The block where Takahisa Ogawa's house once stood is now just a row of overgrown lots, littered with concrete debris. A small statue of a stone frog is all that remains of his garden, which is also scattered with wild boar droppings.
He finally demolished his house last year after he failed to convince his wife and two sons to return to live in Futaba.
Ogawa doubts any of his childhood friends and neighbors would ever return to the town.
""I've passed the stage where I'm angry and I'm resigned,"" he said."

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co has started calling back many of the 450 workers it laid off earlier this month in eastern Canada, when blockades crippled operations on strategic rail lines, according to a company email sent to customers on Friday.
Earlier this week, police made 10 arrests and cleared a blockade in eastern Canada that had been stopping freight and passenger traffic for almost three weeks on one of Canada's busiest lines.
The blockades were held in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en people in the Pacific province of British Columbia, who are seeking to stop TC Energy Corp from building a gas pipeline over their land.
""In the absence of illegal blockades on our network over the last 24 hours, and while we are keeping a close watch for any further disruptions, we have started calling back many of the temporarily laid off employees based in Eastern Canada,"" CN chief executive Jean-Jacques Ruest said in the email seen by Reuters.
The email did not specify how many of the 450 workers were being called back.
After 21 days of disruptions, ""there is a significant backlog of trains parked on our tracks and in our yards that will be processed,"" the email said.
""The complete network recovery process will take several weeks.""
Montreal-based CN said the company was on its way to recovering in Western Canada, and said products like export grain, imported containerized goods, coal, potash and other commodities are moving to market.
Canada relies on CN and rival Canadian Pacific Railway to move crops, oil, potash, coal and manufactured goods to ports and the United States. About half of Canada’s exports move by rail, according to industry data."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union kick off talks on Monday on how their relationship will shape up after Brexit, with half a trillion euros worth of annual trade and close security ties at stake in what are bound to be tense talks.
Both sides say they want to reach a deal by the end of the year so that new cooperation on everything from aviation to fisheries to student exchanges can kick in from 2021.
The current status-quo transition period that followed Britain's exit from the bloc on Jan. 31 expires at the end of year.
Around 100 UK officials will be arriving in the EU hub Brussels for the first round of talks with the bloc's executive European Commission that are due to last until Thursday.
The second round will be held in London later in March and then more are due to follow every two-three weeks.
The EU wants give Britain beneficial access to its single market of 450 million people in exchange for solid guarantees that London would prevent dumping.
But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants to move away from the EU and refuses to be bound by its rules or the jurisdiction of its top court -- all necessary, in the bloc's view, to ensure fair competition.
He has upset the bloc by backpedaling on a possible more ambitious and broader future relationship the sides had agreed in their divorce package last year.
Senior British minister Michael Gove set an uncompromising tone for London's position in a an editorial on Sunday, the eve of the new talks.
""We want the best possible trading relationship with the EU. But we will not trade away our newly recovered sovereignty,"" he wrote.
Britain and the EU will assess in June whether sealing a basic trade deal is possible by the end of the year.
Without one, trade volumes could shrink dramatically if the sides default to World Trade Organization terms, which include tariffs and quotas.
The lack of trust between the EU and Britain has been exacerbated by comments from London that it might not carry out border controls on the sensitive Irish frontier, the most fraught issue in the talks.
There is also a tonal gap between the bloc's more rigid, legalistic approach and Johnson's free-wheeling style.
""All in all, it's already clear that June will the a difficult month. It is hard to see much progress being possible by then so things will start getting tense,"" said one EU diplomat involved in Brexit talks."
99,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2020 07:13PM ET</span>",Campaigners urge PM Johnson to 'turbocharge' climate plans ahead of U.N. summit,"By Matthew Green
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson should ""turbocharge"" policies to cut Britain's carbon emissions so the country can lead by example when it hosts a major U.N. climate summit in Glasgow in November, campaign groups said on Monday.
Although Britain was the first G7 nation to adopt a legally-binding target to cut CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050, campaigners say the commitment will carry little weight unless the government starts showing it is serious.
""The UK must also get its own house in order,"" said a letter to Johnson backed by 60 groups working on the environment and international development, including Oxfam, Greenpeace, ShareAction and the World Wildlife Fund.
""The coming months must see a green turbocharging of our decarbonisation policies and investment to maximize our emissions reductions, so that we reach net-zero as soon as possible,"" said the letter, signed by representatives of the Climate Coalition and Bond, two umbrella groups.
The campaigners set out their priorities in a ""Glasgow Action Plan https://www.theclimatecoalition.org/glasgowactionplan"" that included Britain unveiling more ambitious and detailed decarbonization plans ahead of the summit, stopping financing fossil fuel projects abroad, and leading international efforts to boost aid for countries hit by climate disasters.
Britain should also ramp up support for what are known as ""nature-based solutions"" - harnessing processes at work in soil, forests, grasslands, peatlands, mangroves or other ecosystems to absorb and store large amounts of carbon, the letter said.
Preparations for the Nov. 9-20 summit were marred by acrimony in January when Johnson sacked former energy minister Claire O'Neill as summit president, prompting her to write a scathing letter saying his government's promises of action ""are not close to being met.""
With the Earth currently on track for temperature increases that could render many currently densely populated regions uninhabitable, the summit is seen as critical to shoring up the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.
The British hosts are supposed to take the lead in cajoling big polluting countries into announcing more ambitious targets to cut emissions in the run-up to the gathering.
For its part, Britain can point to progress in reducing emissions from its power sector by switching to renewables, but it has made less headway in cleaning up heating, transport, agriculture and industry.

Three days of national mourning were declared for Cardenal, who rose to fame in 1983 when Pope John Paul II refused to acknowledge the kneeling priest due to his refusal to relinquish his involvement in politics. He was later suspended by the church for more than three decades over his political activism.
Despite his passion for politics and religion, Cardenal's love for writing came first.
""I've had the vocation of a poet since I was born. The religious involvement came later in life,"" Cardenal told Mexican newspaper La Jornada in an interview in 2003. ""To that I added the revolutionary vocation: surrender to God led me to surrender to the people.""
Cardenal practiced Latin America's liberation theology, which combines religious teachings with calls for social justice.
He was born in the central city of Granada on Jan. 20, 1925, in one of the country's most influential families. 
After being ordained in 1965, he founded a Christian community on an island that he bought with family money.
Early last year he was admitted to a Managua hospital for a serious kidney infection. However, he recovered and returned to his literary routine, wearing his signature black beret. 
A LOVE OF LITERATURE 
Cardenal's support for the Sandinista National Liberation Front party dates back to the early 1960s. After the party rose to power in 1979, he became more involved and even served as minister of culture for about eight years.
For those political activities, Pope John Paul II sanctioned Cardenal in 1984, expelling him from the priesthood. The papal sanction lasted for 35 years, despite the fact that Cardenal distanced himself from the party and became one of Ortega's fiercest critics after his return to power in 2007.
He kept up that criticism as protests against the Ortega government mounted in recent years. 

In mid-February 2019, as Cardenal's health worsened, Pope Francis overturned the papal sanction.

101,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2020 05:25PM ET</span>","Recession, record violence hit support for Mexico president: poll","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Record levels of violence and an economic slump are taking an increasing toll on support for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, an opinion poll showed on Sunday.
The Feb. 20-26 survey of 1,000 Mexican adults by pollster Buendia & Laredo showed the president's approval rating had slipped to 62% from 67% in late November. In February 2019, backing for the veteran leftist stood at 85%, the poll said.
""Bit by bit, the economy and security are starting to cut through more,"" said Jorge Buendia, head of the polling firm.
Lopez Obrador took office in December 2018 promising to bring down record levels of gang-fueled violence and to ramp up economic growth. Instead, he presided over a mild recession last year, and was unable to stop homicides rising to new heights.
Holding daily news conferences at 7 a.m., the 66-year-old has been adept at shaping the political agenda, blaming Mexico's problems on the legacy of corruption and ""neo-liberal"" privatizations he says he inherited from previous governments.
But his response to a slew of brutal murders in recent weeks, including one of a 7-year-old girl and another of a young woman mutilated by her partner, has been less surefooted, sparking protests and helping galvanize opposition to him.
The survey suggested that confidence in the government was lower than in the president. Some 40% of respondents said the country was on the wrong track, up from 29% in November, while 49% took the opposite view, down from 57% in the previous poll.
That net positive balance of opinion of 9 percentage points represented a sharp decrease from the survey's positive balance of 56 points one year earlier.
Launching attack after attack on what he describes as his ""conservative"" opponents, Lopez Obrador has admitted to polarizing Mexico. The latest survey suggested that divisions in society have widened as his popularity frays.
Support for the president among Mexicans with lower levels of education has held up far better, the poll showed.
In August 2019, Lopez Obrador had a 70% approval rating among respondents with only primary education, a 73% rating among those attaining only secondary levels of education, and 68% among Mexicans who had university degrees or better.
By February, the approval rating among the first two groups was only slightly lower, standing at 69% and 67% respectively. But support among the university-educated had plunged to 43%."

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology experts that called into question the alleged election fraud that drove Bolivian President Evo Morales to resign has triggered sniping between left and right-leaning governments in Latin America.
The analysis by two researchers in MIT's Election Data and Science Lab, made public last week, stated that an Organization of American States (OAS) finding that fraud helped Morales win was flawed and concluded that it was ""very likely"" the socialist president won the October vote by the 10 percentage points needed to avoid a runoff.
The OAS in a statement on Friday dismissed the MIT study as ""unscientific.""
Bolivia will run a fresh election in May. The MIT study prompted Morales, who fled Bolivia first to Mexico and then to Argentina, to call on Sunday for the ""democratic"" international community to steward the upcoming election carefully.
""The coup-mongerers intend to disqualify our candidates,"" Morales wrote on Twitter.
The OAS report cited several violations in the October election including a hidden computer server designed to tilt the vote toward Morales, who served as Bolivia's president for 14 years. Morales resigned amid violence in Bolivia in the aftermath of the election fraud allegations, declaring he was the victim of a ""coup.""
Morales has said he will return to Bolivia, but has been charged by the caretaker government with sedition and blocked from running as a candidate for senator.
Leaders of a number of left-leaning Latin American countries supportive of Morales have weighed in since the release of the MIT report, with Mexico asking the OAS to clarify its findings.
Venezuela's socialist President Nicolas Maduro reiterated his claim that the OAS is a tool of the United States, posting on Twitter on Sunday that the MIT study was ""more proof that the Ministry of the Colonies (OAS) threatens the will of the free peoples of the continent.""
Argentine President Alberto Fernandez said the report's findings justified his continued support for Morales.
""We demand the prompt democratization of Bolivia, with the full participation of the Bolivian people and without prescriptions of any kind,"" Fernandez wrote on Twitter.
Conservative leaders in Latin America backed the OAS.
Ernesto Araujo, Brazil's foreign minister, said fraud in Bolivia's election had been ""crystal clear"".
Tuto Quiroga, a former Bolivian president who is running in the upcoming election, called the MIT study a ""rehash of old lies."" Quiroga pointed out that Morales had himself asked the OAS to review the October election, called a fresh vote after the OAS report on the matter and dismissed members of the country's electoral board.
MIT did not respond to a request for comment."

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Any reservations Afghanistan has with Islamabad should be resolved bilaterally rather than involving the United States, Pakistan’s foreign minister said on Sunday, in reference to part of a joint U.S.-Afghan declaration on peace efforts.
The declaration was announced on Saturday by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at a ceremony to coincide with the signing in Doha of an agreement between the Taliban and the United States.
""The United States commits to facilitate discussions between Afghanistan and Pakistan to work out arrangements to ensure neither country’s security is threatened by actions from the territory of the other side,"" one of the clauses of the declaration reads.
Pakistan bristled.
""They should talk directly to Pakistan. The U.S. is planning to withdraw and we will always remain neighbors,” Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told Reuters in an interview, referring to Washington's intent to withdraw troops from Afghanistan.
""If I have an issue with Afghanistan, I will not ask Washington to play a role.""
Pakistan and Afghanistan have been at loggerheads for years. Kabul publicly blames Pakistan for harboring Taliban leaders after they were ousted from power Afghanistan in 2001, and allowing safe havens for attacks against international and Afghan forces.
Islamabad has denied these allegations and blames Afghanistan for giving anti-Pakistan militants refuge to plot attacks in Pakistan, which, in turn, Kabul denies.
""You know a trust deficit has existed and Pakistan has done its best to bridge that trust deficit,"" Qureshi said, adding there are institutionalized mechanisms through which Afghanistan can raise ""any issue under the sun"" instead of turning to the United States.
He said that the U.S.-Taliban agreement in Doha would never have happened if Pakistan had not convinced everyone that there was no military solution to the 18-year conflict in Afghanistan.
The Doha agreement was signed by U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Abdul Ghani Baradar. 
Under it, Washington committed to a full withdrawal in 14 months, and to working with allied international forces to do the same – contingent on the Taliban keeping a pledge to renounce violence and sever ties with militant organizations threatening the Untied States and its allies.
FACILITATION ROLE
Qureshi said Pakistan had facilitated the accord by persuading both the Taliban and the United States to find a political settlement, adding that getting both sides to see this had not been easy.
""We convinced the Taliban to put forward an authoritative delegation that has the capacity to implement what they agree upon, and that wouldn’t have happened without Pakistan’s facilitation,"" Qureshi said.
Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Baradar, who signed the Doha agreement on the militant group’s behalf on Saturday, was held in Pakistani custody for eight years after being captured in a joint raid with U.S. agents in 2010 in the Pakistani port city of Karachi where he was in hiding.
The arrest followed months of behind-the-scenes prodding by U.S. officials who saw inaction by Islamabad as a major threat to their Afghan war strategy.
Baradar was not handed over to Afghanistan or the United States and was released in 2018. After that he became the head of the Taliban’s negotiation team that held talks with the U.S. negotiators for over a year in Doha.
“That was another demonstration of facilitation,” Qureshi said, adding, “You required someone who who enjoyed the confidence of the leadership to engage (with the U.S.) that would make the talks possible.”
“He (Baradar) played a very positive role.”
Qureshi also said Pakistan played a part in pushing for the negotiation process to restart after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the plug on negotiations in September last year.

In October 2019, while the Doha talks were off, Washington’s chief negotiator, special representative Zalmay Khalilzad, and the Taliban political delegation held talks in Islamabad in a meeting that was not publicly acknowledged.

Officials with King County Public Health said the two latest cases involved men in their 60s with underlying medical issues. Both were listed in critical condition, one at Valley Medical Center, and the other at Virginia Mason Medical Center.
Separately, officials at the Life Care Center of Kirkland said in a statement late on Saturday that it was not accepting new patients or allowing visitors, family or vendors into the facility while officials focus on the health of the current residents and staff.
The two cases, announced on Saturday by Washington state officials, involved a worker who is in her 40s and in satisfactory condition and a 70-year-old woman who lived there and is in serious condition.
State officials said an additional 27 residents of the nursing home and 25 staff members were reporting symptoms of the virus, which can be similar to that of the common flu.
""Concerned family members or responsible parties may call our facility,"" the statement said. ""The facility is currently placing a hold on admissions as well to fully focus on our current residents and associates.""
A representative for the nursing home could not be reached by Reuters on Sunday for further comment.
The nursing home said members of its corporate clinical team were on site to provide assistance and that the home was in contact with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Washington Health Department.
On Saturday, officials said a Washington state man in his 50s with underlying health issues became the United States' first fatality from the coronavirus.
The patient, who was chronically ill before contracting COVID-19, died at EvergreenHealth Hospital in Kirkland, near Seattle, and officials are unsure how he was exposed to the virus, said Jeffrey Duchin, head of the Washington state Health Department's communicable disease unit.
The fast-spreading virus has infected around 83,000 people in more than 50 countries, with about 70 cases in the United States."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Sunday said it was investigating complaints that federal workers were not given proper protective gear and training before greeting U.S. citizens evacuated from a cruise ship that had 691 people infected with the new coronavirus.
U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" he was personally involved in the probe, and the government was determined to make sure its workers were kept safe.
Azar told CBS it had been 14 days since any HHS worker had contact with the evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and none had contracted the disease.
About 70 cases have been reported in the United States, including 47 cases among people repatriated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the supposed epicenter of the outbreak, or from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan.
""Even if these allegations proved to be true, there was no spreading of the disease from this,"" he said, adding that the department had offered to test any HHS employees involved if they wanted what he called ""that extra piece of mind.""
Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Azar said the government would not allow any retaliation against the HHS worker who first raised concerns about the issue or other employees.
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal and Representative Jimmie Gomez, a Democrat from California, last week asked the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office to provide answers within a week about reports that HHS had retaliated against the whistleblower in question. 
In a separate letter to Azar, the lawmakers said the whistleblower alleged that ""staff were sent into quarantined areas 'without personal protective equipment, training, or experience in managing public health emergencies, safety protocols, and the potential danger to both themselves and members of the public they come into contact with.'""
They said the whistleblower also reported that when staff raised safety concerns, they were ""admonished ... for decreasing staff morale, accused of not being team players, and had their mental health and emotional stability questioned.'""
On Sunday, Azar declined to provide details on whether the whistleblower had been reassigned to a different position, saying it would be inappropriate to discuss personnel matters.

""Nobody would ever be reassigned or discriminated against or prejudiced or retaliated against because of raising concerns about the functioning of the department,"" Azar said. ""If our employees raise concerns about our processes, if something proves not to be right, we are grateful.""

107,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2020 02:51PM ET</span>","Angered by Trump's plan, Israel's Arabs look to oust Netanyahu","By Rami Ayyub
NAZARETH, Israel (Reuters) - On the eve of Israel's third election in a year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been urging supporters to mount a final push to win the one or two more seats he says he needs to form a government.
But as he campaigns, another force in Israeli politics - the Arab minority - is hoping to use a new surge of anger against the right-wing leader and his U.S. allies to edge the electoral arithmetic the other way.
Arab lawmakers are urging their communities to turn out in ever greater numbers on March 2 to show their opposition to the new peace plan - dubbed the ""Deal of the Century"" - unveiled by U.S. President Donald Trump in January.
Anger among Israel's Arabs has focused on one part of that plan in particular, a proposed redrawing of borders that would put some Arab towns and villages outside Israel and into the area assigned to a future Palestinian state.
""There is someone who set this plan: Benjamin Netanyahu,"" said Ayman Odeh, chief of the Arab-dominated Joint List coalition.
""We need to overthrow him, our biggest agitator, the person behind the Deal of the Century,"" Odeh added during a stop in Taibe, a village that could be moved outside Israel under Trump's plan.
Polls show Netanyahu's Likud movement virtually neck and neck with centrist leader Benny Gantz's Blue and White party. 
Arab lawmakers currently hold 13 seats in the 120-member Knesset. If the Arab and centrist blocs both hold their voting share - and certainly if they increase - that would make it harder for Netanyahu to get the extra seats he needs in the country's finely-balanced political set-up.
Nearly 80% of Arabs who are familiar with the Trump plan oppose it, according to a Feb. 24 poll by the Konrad Adenauer Program for Jewish-Arab Cooperation at Tel Aviv University.
The poll's author, Arik Rudnitzky, said the Trump initiative had injected ""new blood into this relatively calm electoral campaign"" and forecast a slight increase in Arab turnout over last September's election, from 59% to 60%.
Graphic: Trump's Middle East plan - https://graphics.reuters.com/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-PLAN/0100B5B73B0/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-PLAN.jpg 
""I AM STILL OCCUPIED""
Israel's Arab minority - Palestinian by heritage, Israeli by citizenship - makes up 21 per cent of Israel's population.
Mostly Muslim, Christian and Druze, they are descendants of the Palestinians whose communities, including Nazareth, found themselves inside Israel as the country was formed in 1948.
Their political representatives have had to choose their words diplomatically as they push their campaign against Netanyahu.
If they reject the notion of coming under Palestinian rule too aggressively or overtly, they could be seen as selling out their brethren in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. But if they embrace that notion, they risk losing the benefits of Israeli citizenship.
""Everyone wants to stay in Israel, everyone wants an Israeli I.D. because they can see the situation in the West Bank, and here it is better,"" said Zuhri Haj Yahya, a Taibe resident.
He said it made no difference to his sense of identity whether he lived under Israeli or Palestinian rule. 
""I am Palestinian,"" he said. ""I am still occupied, whether I am here or there.""
As the election neared, Netanyahu dismissed concerns about land swaps and sought to win over Arab voters. 
""The last thing I believe in is uprooting anyone from their home. No one will be uprooted,"" he told Arabic-language channels PANET and Hala TV on Feb. 18.
Likud also said its 15 billion shekel ($4.37 billion) investment program was more than any government ever invested in Arab communities.
But Arab politicians derided Netanyahu's appeals, and his promises of direct flights to Mecca for Muslim pilgrims. 

""What did Netanyahu really do for us,"" asked politician Ahmad Tibi, calling it a last-ditch effort to ""manipulate our community"".

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Argentine President Alberto Fernandez announced on Sunday that he will send to Congress a bill to legalize abortion, an initiative that has broad social support but is also strongly opposed by religious groups in Pope Francis' home nation.
The center-left Peronist president, who took office in December, will also capitalize on his strong electoral mandate to reform the judiciary and Argentina's intelligence services, he told Congress in a speech to open the body's ordinary sessions.
Fernandez was accompanied by a crowd waving the flags of his ""Frente de Todos"" coalition and presented to the house by his vice president and the senate head, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.
The president said the legislative measures would help him keep his promise to fight poverty, which in Argentina blights almost 40% of the population following years of recession and high inflation.
""Within the next 10 days I will present a bill for voluntary termination of pregnancy that legalizes abortion at the start of pregnancy and allows women to access the health system when they make the decision to abort,"" Fernandez said to loud applause.
The initiative, promoted for years by an increasingly powerful feminist movement in Argentina, will be accompanied by a sexual education and pregnancy prevention drive, according to the Fernandez government.
Current Argentine law only permits abortions in cases of rape, or if the mother’s health is at risk. A previous bill to legalize abortion up to 14 weeks was passed by the lower house but rejected by the senate after a campaign by the country's powerful Roman Catholic Church.
Fernandez has also pledged to bolster investment in hydrocarbons production and kick start economic growth.
Successfully renegotiating the repayment terms of some $100 billion of public debt, which the government has said is unpayable in its present condition, will be key to achieving the latter goal.
Fernández hopes to close an agreement with private creditors brokered by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by the end of this month.
""The most important thing is that the agreement we reach with the creditors is sustainable,"" he told Argentine legislators.
On Monday, a new round of dialogues will begin with IMF officials and private creditors."

Juan Carlos Navarrete, a 58-year-old Cuban national serving as a helmsman aboard the Petion Panamax tanker, died after falling overboard while the tanker was anchored in Amuay Bay in western Venezuela, one of the sources, union leader Ivan Freites, said on Sunday.
Neither Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA, nor its oil or information ministries, immediately responded to requests for comment.
Both the Petion and its operator, Cyprus-registered Caroil Transport Marine Ltd, were hit with sanctions by the United States last September for transporting Venezuelan oil to Cuba. Washington has imposed sanctions on PDVSA as part of its bid to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who Cuba supports.
Freites said that since the sanctions, tankers transporting oil between Venezuela and Cuba frequently turn off their lights at night and switch off their location transmission systems to avoid detection, putting the safety of the crew at risk.
""They do these maneuvers without the necessary security conditions,"" Freites said. ""They are not complying with anything.""
Despite the sanctions, the Petion has taken several trips between Cuba and Venezuela in the past three months, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. It was scheduled to depart for Cuba in late February, according to Venezuelan port documents seen by Reuters, but the data show it has remained near Amuay.
Caroil Transport could not immediately be reached for comment.

ROME (Reuters) - The death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy has risen to 34, five more than a day earlier, officials said on Sunday, as the government prepared to boost spending to help the fragile economy.
The head of Italy's Civil Protection Agency said the cumulative number of confirmed cases of the virus had jumped to 1,694 from 1,128 on Saturday, virtually all of them coming to light since Feb. 20 in the worst such contagion in Europe.
Of that number, 83 people had fully recovered, while 140 patients were in intensive care. The vast majority of those who have tested positive have few, if any symptoms.
Around 90% of all cases are concentrated in the wealthy northern regions of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna. The government has ordered that schools and universities must remain closed there for a second week, with large public gatherings still banned in an effort to halt the contagion.
As the human toll grows, the government is increasingly worried about the economic outlook. Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri announced the cabinet would approve this week 3.6 billion euros ($3.5 billion) of measures to help companies.
This came on top of an aid-package worth 900 million euros that was unveiled on Friday for the worst-impacted zones.
""I want to reassure Italians that we are well aware of the problems and dangers,"" Gualtieri said, adding that if additional help was needed it would have to come at a European level.
Opposition politicians said the proposals were far too limited, with the head of the far-right League, Matteo Salvini, demanding ""at least 20 billion euros"" of additional spending.
FLIGHTS CUT
One of the hardest hit sectors is likely to be tourism, which accounts for 13% of gross domestic product, with hotels reporting mass cancellations even in cities with few or no coronavirus cases, such as Rome.
Underscoring the challenges, Turkey on Sunday banned all flights to and from Italy, while both the United States and Japan advised their citizens not to travel to swathes of the north, including tourist hotspots like Venice and Verona.
Cinemas, discos and theaters, including Milan's prestigious La Scala opera house, must remain shuttered in the three hardest-hit regions for a further week, while museums will be allowed to reopen to a limited number of visitors.
For the first time, a church in the heart of Rome announced that it was closing as a precautionary measure after a priest who had been working there came down with the virus.
The St. Louis of the French in Piazza Navona is particularly popular with tourists because it houses paintings by Caravaggio.
A Roman Catholic news agency said the 43-year-old priest had returned to Paris by car in the middle of February and tested positive for the virus on Friday. Only two cases of the disease have come to light so far in Rome -- two Chinese tourists in January -- and it was not clear where the priest was infected.
Pope Francis said on Sunday he had a cold and would have to skip a week-long Lenten spiritual retreat for the first time in his papacy. The Vatican has played down speculation he might have coronavirus, saying he only had a ""slight indisposition"".
The contagion has also hit the sporting world, forcing the cancellation this weekend of five top flight Serie A matches, which followed a similar disruption last week.
The chief executive of Inter Milan, which is vying for the Serie A title, warned on Sunday that the season might not finish at all if any more matches are postponed."

ISTANBUL/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Turkey shot down two Syrian warplanes over Idlib on Sunday and struck a military airport well beyond its frontlines in a sharp escalation of its military operations following the death of dozens of Turkish soldiers last week.
Ankara has ramped up its attacks, including drone strikes, against the Russian-backed Syrian forces since Thursday, when 33 Turkish soldiers were killed in an air strike by Damascus.
It has already deployed thousands of troops and military vehicles in northwest Syria's Idlib province in the last month to stem advances by Syrian government forces which have displaced 1 million people close to Turkey's southern border.
Already hosting 3.6 million Syrian refugees, Ankara is determined to prevent any further influx from Syria. It has also let migrants cross its borders into the European Union, in an apparent effort to press for EU support in tackling the Syria crisis.
Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said in the last four days Turkish forces destroyed eight helicopters, 103 tanks, 72 howitzers, rocket launchers, a drone and six air defense systems. He dubbed Turkey's operation, its fourth incursion in Syria in four years, ""Operation Spring Shield"".
In response, Syria's army said it shot down three Turkish drones and warned it would take down any aircraft breaching the air space over the northwest, which has been controlled for years by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's main ally Russia. 
Despite the warning, Turkish warplanes downed two Syrian warplanes, while Turkey's state-owned Anadolu agency said the Turkish military had targeted and rendered unusable Nayrab airport, west of Aleppo city.
Turkey-backed opposition commanders also said Kuweires airport, east of Nayrab, had been bombed since midnight. Both airports are well inside Syrian government controlled territory, marking a significant expansion of Ankara's targets.
The fighting has risked drawing Russia and Turkey, who cooperated for years to contain the fighting despite backing rival sides in Syria's nine-year war, into direct conflict. 
""We have neither the intention nor the notion to face Russia. Our only intention there is for the (Syrian) regime to end the massacre and thereby prevent ... radicalization and migration,"" Turkey's Akar said.
He said that 2,212 members of the Syrian forces had been ""neutralized"", a term used to designate killed, wounded or captured. The Syrian Observatory, a Britain-based war monitor, said 74 Syrian government troops and pro-Damascus fighters had been killed since Feb. 27.
Fifty-five Turkish troops were killed in Idlib in February. 
CRISIS DIPLOMACY
Diplomatic efforts by Ankara and Moscow to defuse tensions have failed to agree a ceasefire in Idlib, part of Syria's last major rebel stronghold.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Saturday that while there was progress in talks between Turkish and Russian delegations, the Idlib issue would only be resolved between presidents Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin.
A senior Turkish official and a security official said the meeting would be held on Thursday in Moscow. The officials said the two leaders would discuss steps to take in Idlib and that they were expected to reach a mutual agreement.
The Kremlin said it hoped Erdogan and Putin would meet on Thursday or Friday. Cavusoglu and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov agreed on the need to create a ""favorable atmosphere"" to improve working relations between their countries, Russia's foreign ministry said.
The latest fighting in Idlib has uprooted 1 million civilians since December, many of them women and children fleeing towards the Turkish border. 
Turkey said it would allow migrants to cross into Europe in anticipation of an imminent new migrant influx from Idlib, lifting restraints on movement in place since 2016 under a deal with the European Union.
Greek police fired tear gas to repel hundreds of stone-throwing migrants who sought to force their way across the border from Turkey on Sunday, witnesses said, with thousands more behind them after Ankara relaxed curbs on their movement. [nL8N2AU05E]

Turkey's borders to Europe were closed to migrants under the accord between the Turkish-EU deal that halted the 2015-16 migration crisis, when more than 1 million people crossed into Europe.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis announced on Sunday that a cold he is suffering from has forced him to skip a Lenten spiritual retreat with senior Vatican officials near Rome for the first time in his papacy.
The surprise announcement, which will keep him from attending a gathering he holds dear, marked the first health scare for the 83-year-old pontiff since his election in 2013.
As of late Saturday night, the Vatican said that the pope would be taking part in the retreat, indicating that the decision to skip it was a last-minute one. The retreat was due to start on Sunday afternoon.
The pope made the announcement to thousands of people in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) during his first public appearance since last Wednesday, when he was seen coughing and sneezing. 
""Unfortunately a cold will force me not take part this year (in the retreat). I will follow the meditations from here,"" he said, departing from his prepared address.
Francis coughed several times while making his brief address on Sunday and sounded like he had a stuffy nose. Francis is missing a part of one lung. It was removed when he was in his early 20s in his native Buenos Aires after an illness.
The Vatican had previously said only that Francis was suffering from a ""slight indisposition"" that forced him to cancel most audiences in the past three days.
""I will unite myself spiritually with the (participants) and all people who are living moments of prayer. I will do the spiritual exercises from home,"" he said.
The respected website Il Sismografo, which follows Church affairs, said it was the first time since 1950 that a pope has missed a Lenten retreat. 
Home for the pope is Santa Marta, the Vatican guest house where he lives in simple quarters after opting not to use the spacious papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace.
CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK IN ITALY
The pope has been taken ill at a time when Italy is battling a surging outbreak of the potentially deadly coronavirus. His spokesman Matteo Bruni dismissed on Friday speculation that Francis was anything more than slightly unwell.
""There is no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition,"" he said.
A number of people in St. Peter's Square to hear the pope wore surgical face masks. 
Italy has registered more than 1,100 confirmed cases of coronavirus since Feb. 20 and at least 29 deaths - the worst such contagion in Europe.
After his election, Francis broke with the tradition of his predecessors, who held the retreats in the Vatican, and moved them to a Church property in the town of Arricia, south of Rome. 
The cancellation was a personal setback for the pontiff, a member of the Jesuit religious order, which, like other groups in the Church, places great significance in holding retreats and spiritual exercises away from one's normal workplace. 
Some Lent Ash Wednesday services were cancelled or limited in areas of northern Italy hit by the spread of the virus.
The pope skipped a few events at the start of his papacy in 2013 and 2014 but the cause was believed to be of an intestinal nature. 

Francis also suffers some leg pain due to sciatica, for which he undergoes regular physical therapy and which explains his occasional difficulty climbing steps.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani rejected on Sunday a Taliban demand for the release of 5,000 prisoners as a condition for talks with Afghanistan's government and civilians, included in a deal between the United States and the Islamist militants.
""The government of Afghanistan has made no commitment to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners,"" Ghani told reporters in Kabul, a day after the deal was signed in Qatar to start a political settlement aimed at ending the United States' longest war. 
U.S. negotiators face difficulties in shepherding the Afghan government and Taliban toward intra-Afghan negotiations, according to Western diplomats.
Under the accord, the United States and the Taliban are committed to work expeditiously to release combat and political prisoners as a confidence-building measure, with the coordination and approval of all relevant sides. The agreement calls for up to 5,000 jailed Taliban prisoners to be released in exchange for up to 1,000 Afghan government captives by March 10.
On the issue of the prisoner swap, Ghani said, ""It is not in the authority of United States to decide, they are only a facilitator."" 
Ghani told CNN on Sunday that U.S. President Donald Trump had not asked for the release of the prisoners and that the issue of prisoner releases should be discussed as part of a comprehensive peace deal.
""The political consensus ... that would be needed for such a major step does not exist today,"" Ghani said.
Ghani said key issues need to be discussed first including the Taliban's ties with Pakistan and other countries that had offered it sanctuary, its ties with what he called terrorist groups and drug cartels, and the place of Afghan security forces and its civil administration. 
""The people of Afghanistan need to believe that we've gone from war to peace, and not that the agreement will be either a Trojan horse or the beginning of a much worse phase of conflict,"" Ghani added.
Ghani said verifiable mechanisms were needed to ensure commitments made were actually delivered.
Saturday's accord was signed by U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, witnessed by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
After the ceremony, Baradar met foreign ministers from Norway, Turkey and Uzbekistan in Doha along with diplomats from Russia, Indonesia and neighboring nations, the Taliban said, a move that signaled the group's determination to secure international legitimacy.
""The dignitaries who met Mullah Baradar expressed their commitments toward Afghanistan's reconstruction and development. ... the U.S.-Taliban agreement is historical,"" said Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid.
Trump rejected criticism around the deal and said he would meet Taliban leaders in the near future.
Ghani's aides said Trump's decision to meet the Taliban could pose a challenge to Afghanistan's government at a time when the U.S. troop withdrawal becomes imminent.
'NO LEGAL STANDING'
Iran on Sunday dismissed the agreement as a pretext to legitimize the presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
""The United States has no legal standing to sign a peace agreement or to determine the future of Afghanistan,"" the Iranian Foreign Ministry said in a statement reported by state media.
Under the agreement, Washington is committed to reducing the number of its troops in Afghanistan to 8,600 from 13,000 within 135 days of signing. The United States also is committed under the accord to work with allies to proportionally reduce the number of coalition forces in Afghanistan over that period, if the Taliban forces adhere to their security guarantees and ceasefire.
A full withdrawal of all U.S. and coalition forces would occur within 14 months, the joint statement said.
The withdrawal depends on security guarantees by the Taliban, who ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and imposed many restrictions on women and activities it deemed ""un-Islamic"".
After being ousted from power in 2001 in a U.S.-led invasion following the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States engineered by al Qaeda forces harbored by the Taliban, the Taliban have led a violent insurgency.

The Afghan war has been a stalemate for more than 18 years, with the Taliban increasingly controlling or contesting more territory yet unable to capture and hold major urban centers.

DUBAI (Reuters) - As the new coronavirus spreads across Iran, the epicenter of the outbreak in the Middle East, so a feeling of anxiety grows among many Iranians, some of whom worry the clerical establishment has not got a firm grip on the illness.
Every day trucks filled with disinfectants spray down streets, shrines, public parks, trash bins, public toilets and markets in Qom, Tehran and other areas that have had cases of infection.
State TV showed workers wiping down metro and bus stations.
""The smell of disinfectants has become my nightmare,"" said retired teacher Ziba Rezaie, 62, from Qom. ""The city smells like a cemetery, a morgue.""
The escalating outbreak in Iran has killed 54 people and infected 978, according to the Health Ministry on Sunday.
Authorities have called on Iranians to avoid public places and stay at home, while schools, universities, cultural and sports centers have been temporarily closed across the country.
""We have not left the house for a week. Children have online classes. Only my husband leaves the house for shopping and for work,"" said Samar, 38, in the city of Shiraz.
Trying to prevent panic, the government has not locked down Qom, a holy Shi'ite Muslim city identified by authorities as the center of contagion, but has imposed broad restrictions such as limitations on who is allowed in and out of the city.
Some religious hardliners, including clerics, have dismissed the idea of closing the holy site to prevent the spread of the virus, arguing that the shrine in Qom is ""a place for healing"".
Videos on social media showed some people licking the doors and the burial mound inside the Masumeh shrine, defying advice by the Health Ministry to avoid touching or kissing any surfaces in the shrine, a common practice for pilgrims.
DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCES
The head of the World Health Organization's emergencies program, Mike Ryan, said on Feb. 27 that Iran may be dealing with an outbreak that is worse than yet understood.
Authorities announced Iran's first infections and two deaths from the virus on Feb. 19. Iranian officials, including President Hassan Rouhani, have repeatedly dismissed concerns raised by many Iranians over the handling of the outbreak, saying all the necessary measures to overcome the crisis have been taken.
Some doctors and nurses contacted by Reuters said hospitals in Tehran, Qom and Rasht city were overloaded.
""Hospitals are full of infected people. We hear about hundreds of deaths,"" said a doctor in Tehran, who asked not to be named. ""We need more hospitals. The death toll will rise.""
The Health Ministry has ordered hospitals to admit only infected people and those patients who need immediate care. Dozens of military-run hospitals have been allocated to treat the infected people.
A doctor in Qom, who also asked not to be named, told Reuters on Sunday that the illness had been circulating days before it was announced. ""We had many patients with the same symptoms. But they were treated with flu medicine and sent back home.""
Some critics accused the clerical rulers of initially concealing the outbreak to secure a high participation in state-organized rallies in February. Some others suggested there was a cover-up to ensure a high turnout in Feb. 21 parliamentary polls. Government spokesman Ali Rabeie on Thursday rejected this accusation, saying the outbreak should not be politicized.
""It has spread across the country. How is it possible in 10 days? Obviously they concealed facts to go ahead with their own plans. They lied to us again,"" said Fariba, 34, a high school teacher in the city of Tabriz.
Iranians' confidence in their leaders has been damaged over bloody crackdowns of several protests since last year and the belated acknowledgement of the accidental shooting down in January of a Ukrainian airliner that killed all 176 aboard.
""If my children don't die from this virus, they will die of hunger,"" construction worker Ali Hosseini, 39, told Reuters from Qom. ""Construction business is dead now and I am jobless."""

The 32-year-old woman had been under an Interpol arrest warrant. She had escaped to Slovakia from Budapest in the boot of a car after her hiding place in the Hungarian capital had been identified by police last week, police said.
After taking control of the group in 2017, the woman reorganized the gang by recruiting members of the KS Cracovia soccer team's extremist fans to engage in international drug trafficking, according to a police statement.
Slovakian authorities must now decide whether to extradite the woman to Poland, but her lawyer said recent judiciary reforms had undermined the fairness of the Polish court system.
""In current circumstances handing (the woman) over to Polish law enforcement authorities would be tantamount to handing her over to wild cannibals,"" Maciej Burda told private broadcaster TVN24.
No one at Poland's Justice Ministry or Cracovia soccer club was immediately available to comment.

The man arrived in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, on Feb. 24 from Milan on a Turkish Airlines flight that had a connection in Istanbul. The following day he traveled to neighboring Ogun state and was in the country for almost two full days before being isolated. Asked in a telephone interview about the number of people Nigerian authorities had been in touch with who may have had contact with the man, Lagos state Health Commissioner Akin Abayomi said: ""It is around 100 people but that number is increasing every minute."" The Italian man, who is being treated at a hospital in the Yaba district of Lagos, works as a vendor for cement company Lafarge Africa Plc in the southwestern state of Ogun. The company issued a statement on Sunday in which it said its cement production lines remainED open. It said 39 people who were in direct contact with the man had been quarantined. The case, which is the first in sub-Saharan Africa, has prompted fears the virus could spread quickly in a region where health systems are already overburdened with cases of malaria, measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases."
122,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2020 09:49AM ET</span>",Newsmaker: So near yet so far for Malaysia's Anwar,"By Krishna N. Das
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Settling down for a recent interview, Anwar Ibrahim recalled his 20-year struggle to become Malaysia's prime minister: surviving a decade in jail on sodomy charges, dealing with allegations of sex tapes and struggling with infighting in his party.
Confident that his dream would be realized within months, he jokingly asked what might be an ""auspicious"" day for a swearing-n.
That day looked as far off as ever on Sunday after a week of turmoil during which his alliance with old foe Mahathir Mohamad unraveled and a third candidate emerged to become prime minister as they fought over the job yet again.
""This ends his lifelong dream to be PM,"" said Harrison Cheng of consultancy Control Risks.
""His coalition has a massive mountain to climb ahead of the next general election... it was hard enough fighting it while in power; it will be exponentially harder from the opposition benches.""
The relationship between Anwar and Mahathir shaped politics in the Southeast Asian country for two decades.
Their pact in 2018 at the head of a multi-ethnic coalition ended the 60-year dominance of a party that both were once part of, but tensions persisted - particularly over Mahathir's promise to one day hand power to Anwar.
That promise appeared nullified when Mahathir resigned abruptly a week ago.
It become an impossibility once both were swept aside despite a late attempt to restore their alliance.
Anwar had tried to build a coalition to show the king that he could win a majority in parliament, but he never had enough seats without Mahathir's support. Mahathir meanwhile failed in a bid to form a unity government that Anwar rejected.
The king chose Malay nationalist Muhyiddin Yassin as the leader most likely to win majority support.
""Clearly there was treachery. But as I said, we have to move on,"" Anwar told reporters.
His movement, now behind Mahathir, said it would still try to challenge Muhyiddin's legitimacy in parliament.
FALLING OUT
Anwar joined the United Malays National Organization (UMNO)in 1982, soon after Mahathir became prime minister for the first time. He rose rapidly to become deputy prime minister in 1993, on course to succeed Mahathir.
He was sacked in 1998 due to differences over economic policy and emerged as Mahathir's main opponent.
His battle cry was ""Reformasi"" (Reform) and he drew support from Malays tired of the old order as well as ethnic minorities. He was more liberal than Mahathir and other rivals and became a darling of the West.
But his campaign was crushed in 1999 when he was jailed on corruption and sodomy charges that he denied and said were politically motivated.
He tried to rebuild his base after being released in 2004, but was again jailed for sodomy in 2015 under then prime minister Najib Razak - now on trial for corruption.
Anwar was pardoned by the country's king and released after the shock election win that toppled Najib in 2018.
Anwar took no official position in Mahathir's administration, but helped to shape policies. His wife, Wan Azizah Ismail, was deputy prime minister.
Anwar faced yet more accusations of sexually assaulting a former male aide last year. The case was dropped, but his supporters saw yet another attempt to destroy him.
""I've had such a horrific life and experience in the past. More than 10 and a half years in prison,"" he told Reuters in the interview last month. ""But do I live to just reflect and clear the excess of the past, or move on? So that's my intended interest, to move on."""

Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy agreed in December to send prisoners home, and scores were handed over just before the end of the year.
But many others are still being held, casting a shadow over efforts to roll out a peace deal and, eventually, settle the status of the disputed region where the fighting raged between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's parliament adjourned again on Sunday a session to approve the cabinet proposed by Prime Minister-designate Mohammed Allawi because of a lack of quorum, state TV said.
Lawmakers had already on Thursday failed to agree on a new government, prolonging deadlock and delaying attempts to resolve unprecedented mass unrest and has stalled the country’s recovery from years of war. 
Political infighting and alleged widespread corruption have crippled Iraq’s efforts to recover from two U.S. invasions, sanctions and the war to defeat Islamic State in 2017.
The country faces a mass protest movement that broke out in October and brought down former Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi two months later. His cabinet has stayed on in a caretaker capacity.
The protests, which first demanded jobs and services, quickly turned into calls for the removal of Iraq’s entire ruling elite. Protesters oppose Allawi because they view him as part of the system they want to bring down.
Lawmakers have until Monday to agree a cabinet or President Barham Salih will need to designate a new candidate for prime minister, according to the constitution.
Security forces and powerful militia groups have shot dead hundreds of mostly unarmed demonstrators. Around 500 people have been killed in unrest since October, most of them protesters, according to a Reuters tally from medics and police. 
The number of protesters has reduced somewhat, but demonstrations continue on a daily basis.
Allawi issued a long list of promises when he was nominated this month: to hold early elections, punish people who killed protesters, end foreign interference and check the power of non-state armed groups - an ambitious program for a prime minister who has no particular party behind him.
Abdul Mahdi became beholden to the interests of Iran-backed Shi’ite Muslim paramilitary groups and other parties that have a strong representation in parliament and control government posts.
Government officials say Allawi’s cabinet selection was heavily influenced by renegade Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has gained from the general chaos in Iraq after the United States killed a senior Iranian commander in Baghdad in January.

Sunni and Kurdish political groups who stood to lose portfolios in a cabinet of ostensible independents have vehemently opposed Allawi’s choices.

DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar's role in clinching a historic U.S.-Taliban accord over the weekend could further strengthen its relationship with key ally Washington despite efforts by fellow Gulf Arab states locked in a dispute with Doha to sideline it on the world stage.
The deal, which creates a path for the United States to gradually pull out of Afghanistan and opens the way for a potential end to the 18-year conflict, was signed after more than 1-1/2 years of talks that were held mostly in Doha, which hosts the Taliban's political headquarters.
""Qatar has been an enormously important partner to get us to this very moment. When we've had hiccups in the road they have helped us smooth them out,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters after the signing ceremony in Doha on Saturday.
Although peace negotiations between the sides within Afghanistan could now drag on for years, the Doha accord allows Trump to claim a major foreign policy success.
""The Qataris have essentially tried to make themselves crucial to the United States in being mediators where the Americans need mediators and of course post-2017... positioning Qatar that way was very important,” said James Dorsey of S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies and Middle East Institute in Singapore.
In 2017, Trump initially appeared to side with Saudi Arabia and its allies when they severed ties with Qatar over allegations it supports terrorism and is cosying up to regional foe Iran.
Doha denies the charges and says the political, trade and travel embargo imposed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt since mid-2017 aims to curtail its sovereignty.
Washington, which wants a united Gulf front against Iran, has tried to mediate an end to the dispute which erupted from long simmering tensions over tiny but wealthy Qatar's outsized role in the Middle East and its sponsorship of opposing factions in regional conflicts.
SOFT POWER
The Taliban deal could place Qatar in a position to help de-escalate tensions between Washington and Iran. Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base in the region and shares a giant gas field with Iran, which sided with Doha in the Gulf spat.
""I think now global actors know where to go if they want conflicts resolved in our region,"" Qatar's assistant foreign minister Lolwah Rashid Al Khater told reporters on Saturday.
Two Western diplomats told Reuters that Qatar played a vital role when U.S.-Taliban negotiations broke down.
A Qatari official involved in the process said Doha looked for a ""face-saving"" way to salvage talks when Trump canceled a meeting in September with Taliban leaders at Camp David after the group claimed an attack in Kabul that killed a U.S. soldier.
""We thought about two things to do. Number one a hostage release or swap and the second one to work on a reduction in violence,"" said Mutlaq Al Qahtani, Qatar's foreign ministry envoy for counterterrorism and mediation of conflict resolution.
""We thought if we succeeded in those two points we can save the process and bring the parties to the negotiating table again, and that's what we did in November,"" he told Saturday's news briefing.
He was referring to the Talibans' release of American and Australian professors, held hostage for over three years, in November in return for the release of three Taliban commanders. A seven-day reduction in violence period preceded Saturday's signing.
Qatar also advised Washington against ""fragmentation and proliferation"" of efforts, he said, in an apparent reference to attempts by Doha's rivals to host some rounds of the talks.
Taliban representatives and U.S. officials had met in the UAE in December 2018 with representatives from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the UAE also taking part.
Prominent UAE commentator Abdulkhaleq Abdulla said in a Twitter post on Saturday that while the U.S.-Taliban deal should have happened under the aegis of ""a Gulf state other than Qatar"", it was still considered a victory for Gulf diplomacy.
Qatari Twitter user Hamad al-Qahtani shot back that the ""victory is solely for Qatari diplomacy""."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian summers are now effectively twice as long as its winters as climate change has increased temperatures since the middle of the last century, research released in the wake of the nation's unprecedented fire season showed on Monday.
The report by the Australia Institute, a Canberra-based think tank, compared data from the past two decades with mid-20th century benchmarks of temperatures at the calendar start of seasons in temperate and sub-tropical parts of the country.
Over the last two decades, summer across most of Australia has been on average one month longer than half a century ago, while winter has contracted by an average three weeks.
Over the past five years, the analysis showed, Australian summers were on average 50% longer than they were in the mid-twentieth century based on temperature readings.
""Our findings are not a projection of what we may see in the future,"" said Richie Merzian, climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute. ""It's happening right now.""
The report was released as Australia counts the cost of a devastating and lengthy bushfire season that burned nearly 12 million hectares (30 million acres) of bushland, killing 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals.
Dubbed a ""black summer"" by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the unusually prolonged and intense bushfires have increased pressure on the government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
While the major fires have been contained or extinguished, more than a dozen were still burning at the end of February, which traditionally marks the end of summer in Australia.
Scientists have warned that increased temperatures and heatwaves will lead to more dangerous fire seasons and severe weather events, while shorter winters will reduce the window for hazard reduction to mitigate the impact of fires.
The Australia Institute report found that some regional areas, such as Port Macquarie on the mid-north coast of New South Wales state, experienced more pronounced shifts, with seven additional weeks of summer. The Port Macquarie region was one of the hardest hit by wildfires in recent months.
""Extreme heat events are the most fatal of all natural hazards and have been responsible for more deaths in Australia than all other natural hazards put together,"" Merzian said."
131,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2020 07:49AM ET</span>",Newsmaker: Malaysia's Mahathir down but still not out at 94,"By Rozanna Latiff and Joseph Sipalan
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - ""I feel like I should retire, I'm so old now. But when I see what's happening in this country...,"" 94-year-old Mahathir Mohamad said at a youth meeting of his party on Sunday.
After his spectacular political gamble backfired and left him out of the prime minister's office, the man who has dominated Malaysian politics for decades spent the day rallying opposition to the man who replaced him.
Mahathir was the world's oldest head of government after a surprise comeback in a 2018 election, but his resignation a week ago triggered turmoil that he failed to control.
While he conceded that he would have to leave office on Sunday morning after former ally Muhyiddin Yassin was picked as prime minister by the king, he promised to challenge his successor's legitimacy in parliament.
""If we go according to constitution, he is not the right prime minister,"" Mahathir told reporters, looking little dismayed by the possibility that he might not regain power.
""The best proof of the pudding is the eating, so we need to have a parliament sitting now.""
In a career spanning more than seven decades, Mahathir transformed Malaysia into an industrial nation from a rural farming backwater during his first tenure from 1981 to 2003.
He came out of retirement after a corruption scandal at state fund 1MDB to form an alliance with protege-turned-fierce- rival Anwar Ibrahim, now 72, to end more than 60 years of rule by the coalition he once led.
In the process he unseated prime minister Najib Razak, another former ally who is now on trial for corruption.
DOCTOR M.
Born in 1925 during the era of British colonial rule, the medical doctor emerged as a politician with a talent for playing to the feelings of the mainly Muslim ethnic Malay majority.
In 1981, he became prime minister for the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) and launched a mission of modernization and grand construction projects such as Kuala Lumpur's iconic twin towers.
But he was also accused of human rights abuses and detaining political opponents arbitrarily.
In 1998, he fell out with Anwar over the handling of the Asian financial crisis. After Anwar summoned opposition forces against Mahathir, he was jailed for sodomy on charges which he denied and said were politically motivated.
""Looking back now, I realize why, as prime minister of Malaysia, I was described as a dictator,"" Mahathir wrote later.
He stepped down in 2003 for a hand-picked successor, but he never disappeared from view and remained vocal, often criticizing the West and repeatedly claiming that Jews ruled the world by proxy and calling them ""hook-nosed"".
It was the mismanagement under the leadership of Najib, another of his proteges, that brought Mahathir out of retirement and back together with Anwar.
But the relationship between the two men remained strained over a promise that Mahathir would one day hand over to Anwar. That helped precipitate Mahathir's resignation in a bid to form a unity government that could have bolstered his power.
Mahathir said on Sunday that he was also under pressure to resign as Muhyiddin and others in his party tried to form a new alliance that would ditch Anwar and bring back UMNO.
""I had no choice. I had to resign,"" Mahathir said. ""That means I will be back with people I fought against because of their corruption."""
132,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2020 07:19AM ET</span>","No kissing please, we're Swiss, minister urges over coronavirus","VIENNA (Reuters) - Swiss people should consider dropping the everyday greeting of kissing each other on the cheeks, to avoid spreading the coronavirus, Switzerland's Health Minister Alain Berset said in remarks published on Sunday.
In Switzerland, as in neighboring France, it is common for women and people of opposite sexes to greet each other with alternating kisses on both cheeks. The Swiss version generally involves an asymmetrical three in total, in contrast to the two more usual for 'la bise' (the kiss) across the border.
""We know that keeping one's distance socially is the best way to slow the spread of the virus. That is why renouncing greeting kisses is a measure that should be seriously taken into consideration,"" Berset told the SonntagsZeitung newspaper, when asked if he was advising against the greeting.
French Health Minister Olivier Veran advised on Friday against shaking hands because of the coronavirus outbreak, though he stopped short of saying the same of la bise. Switzerland and France border northern Italy, where Europe's worst outbreak has occurred.
Regularly washing or disinfecting your hands is central to the advice issued by the World Health Organization and other authorities on how to prevent the spread of the disease.
Separately, newspaper NZZ am Sonntag quoted a health official as saying Switzerland would issue new guidelines in the coming days on how to guard against the illness.
""One will be to immediately stop shaking hands,"" Daniel Koch, head of the communicable diseases unit at the Swiss Federal Department of Health, told the newspaper.
Switzerland has already introduced a ban on events expected to draw 1,000 people or more until March 15 in an effort to combat the coronavirus. It has fewer than 20 confirmed cases, in contrast to the hundreds in Italy, though that number is rising."

Saturday's fighting broke out after Arakan Army rebels attacked a military convoy passing the historic temple town of Mrauk U, the regional MP, Tun Thar Sein, and a spokesman for the armed group, Khine Thu Kha, said.
Two military spokesmen did not answer telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment, and the army did not immediately issue a statement on its website.
Khine Thu Kha, the Arakan Army spokesman, blamed government troops for the civilian casualties.
A government spokesman said he could not comment.
Reuters was unable to independently confirm the details of the attack in the remote area, where journalists are barred and internet access curtailed.
Myanmar army artillery shells hit the village of Bu Ta Lone, killing four people, the Arakan Army spokesman said in a message.
The MP, a health worker who treated the injured, and a villager said at least five Rohingya, members of a persecuted Muslim minority, had died. A 12-year-old boy was among them, the villager said. 
Military spokesmen did not respond to phone calls from Reuters seeking additional details. A government spokesman sent a text message saying he was in a meeting. 
There were conflicting accounts of the number of Rohingya injured, which ranged from six to 11, along with several members of the state's Rakhine ethnic majority.
Rakhine is the state from which more than 730,000 Rohingya were forced to flee for neighboring Bangladesh after a military crackdown in 2017 that the U.N. has said was executed with genocidal intent. Myanmar denies committing genocide.
Several hundred thousand Rohingya remain in Myanmar, many confined to camps and villages where they are caught in the middle of fresh fighting between the military and Arakan Army, which recruits from the mostly Buddhist majority in a drive for greater autonomy from the central government.
That conflict has displaced tens of thousands and killed dozens.
Tun Thar Sein, the Mrauk U MP, said troops responded with gunfire and shelling in two villages on Saturday after rebels attacked their convoy.
""In response to that, the military started firing at suspicious locations,"" he said.
A local health worker, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, said three of the Rakhine ethnic majority were also injured and one woman had died of cardiac arrest.
TRAPPED BY FIGHTING
Journalists are blocked from traveling to most of central and northern Rakhine, now in the eighth month of a mobile internet shutdown the government justifies on grounds of security.
Many of the several hundred thousand Rohingya still in Rakhine are confined to apartheid-like conditions, unable to travel freely or access healthcare and education.
""Five Muslims died as their bodies were found,"" a Rohingya villager from the area told Reuters on Sunday, asking not to be named for fear of retribution. ""Their funeral was held today.""
He said the bodies had bullet wounds. 
""We can't go out and we can't go anywhere,"" he added. ""We are just staying safe in our village. If this keeps happening, I feel like there is no hope."" 
Saturday's attack was one of several to kill Rohingya this year.
In early January, four Rohingya children died in a blast the military and rebels blamed on each other.
Weeks later, two women were killed after shells hit a village in Buthidaung township, two days after the world court ordered Myanmar to protect the minority. 
At the time, the military blamed the Arakan Army for those deaths, saying it would not have carried out an attack just after a world court verdict in a genocide lawsuit brought by Gambia in November against Myanmar.
In January, the International Court of Justice at the Hague had ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya against further atrocities and preserve evidence of alleged crimes.

The 83-year-old Roman Catholic leader appeared at the window of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace to address thousands of people in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) for his weekly Sunday noon message and blessing.
It was his first public appearance since an Ash Wednesday Mass in Rome, during which he was seen coughing and sneezing.
The Vatican has not specified what was ailing Francis. However, amid fears in Italy over an outbreak of coronavirus, spokesman Matteo Bruni dismissed on Friday speculation that the pope was anything more than slightly unwell.
""There is no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition,"" he said.
Italy is suffering the worst outbreak of coronavirus in Europe, registering more than 1,100 confirmed cases since Feb. 20. At least 29 people have died.
Francis is missing a part of one lung. It was removed when he was in his early 20s in his native Buenos Aires after an illness.
On Sunday afternoon, he and senior Vatican officials were due to travel to a Church residence south of Rome for their annual week-long Lenten spiritual retreat.
Francis will have no official activities during the retreat."

MONTEVIDEO(Reuters) - Uruguay will shift to the right on Sunday with the inauguration of conservative Luis Lacalle Pou as president after 15 years of left-wing rule.
Lacalle Pou has vowed to tame the small South American nation's high fiscal deficit and sign fresh trade deals to dig the beef and soy exporter out of an economic rut.
He faces a delicate balancing act between his two powerful and ideologically-opposed neighbors, Brazil, run by far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, and Argentina, where left-leaning Peronist Alberto Fernandez recently took office.
Bolsonaro is due to attend the inauguration at Montevideo's Legislative Palace, at 1300, along with fellow rightist presidents Sebastian Pinera of Chile and Ivan Duque of Colombia. Argentina's Fernandez said he could not attend because of scheduling problems.
Lacalle Pou has already broken with Uruguay's previous foreign policy norms, declaring the presidents of Venezuela and Cuba to be ""dictators.""
Lacalle Pou, 46, the son of a former president, won election in November by a slim margin, defeating the candidate of the Broad Front, which has been in power for 15 years.
Uruguay, a nation of around 3.5 million people known for its cattle ranches and liberal policies on legalized marijuana and abortion rights, has enjoyed an extended period of stability and growth, but has seen its economy stall amid global trade tensions and bad crop weather that dented agriculture.
Uruguay´s fiscal deficit is equivalent to 4.7% of its gross domestic product, according to data from the central bank at the end of 2019, while last year GDP growth was just 0.5% compared with 7.8% in 2010.
Lacalle Pou will lead a government made up of a coalition of five political parties. He has been in discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to sign a free-trade agreement, which would mark a new direction in relations with the global superpower.
Despite economic concerns, all risk rating companies that audit the Uruguayan economy have maintained it at investment grade in their latest reports, giving the new government some breathing space."
136,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2020 05:38AM ET</span>",Dozens detained at Kazakh protests over activist’s death,"ALMATY/NUR SULTAN (Reuters) - Police in Kazakhstan detained dozens of opposition supporters on Sunday who took to the streets after the death of an anti-government activist in a detention center.
Activist Dulat Agadil died in a jail cell on Feb. 25, a day after police took him in on charges of contempt of court and insulting a judge. The authorities - including President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev - have said his death was caused by acute cardiovascular failure, ruling out any foul play.
Agadil's case has galvanized the oil-rich Central Asian nations' opposition movement, triggering several small-scale protests during the week and calls for a larger one on Sunday that would bring together groups that otherwise rarely coordinate their activities.
But police in the capital, Nur-Sultan, and the biggest city, Almaty, detained dozens of activists while they were still walking toward the rallying points. In Almaty, policemen including some in riot gear cordoned off the city's main square and Reuters reporters saw them detain some 40 people.
A few people shouted ""Wake up Kazakhstan!"" or ""Old man, go away!"" - an opposition slogan aimed at Tokayev’s predecessor and patron Nursultan Nazarbayev who retains sweeping powers even after giving up the presidency a year ago.
In Nur-Sultan, some protesters carried posters that read ""Dulat is a victim of the system"" and ""No to dictatorship"". A Reuters reporter saw police detain about 30 people there.
Street protests are illegal in the former Soviet republic of 19 million unless sanctioned by the authorities."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - ""The power of the Malays has returned,"" rejoiced street hawker Mohd Nor Afiq in Kuala Lumpur after a new prime minister was sworn in to replace 94-year-old Mahathir Mohamad.
With the ascendancy of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, the Southeast Asian country's political switchback will accelerate a return to the days of prioritizing a Malay majority that has felt hard done by since the 2018 election, analysts said.
That is likely to mean an administration willing to spend more freely on affirmative action projects and to put more Malays back into key positions - as well as one that is more religiously conservative in the largely Muslim country.
""The coming to power of a coalition largely based on Malay nationalist and Islamic party credentials completely upends the inclusive and multi-racial government that swept to power in 2018,"" said Michael Vatikiotis, author of a recent book on Southeast Asian politics.
Disaffection among Malays had already been evident through five by-election defeats for the ruling coalition before Mahathir's sudden resignation as prime minister a week ago pitched the country of 32 million into turmoil.
Insiders said such anger was also a factor in the political maneuvering in the days before the king - a post that rotates through Malaysia's nine Malay sultanates - chose Malay nationalist Muhyiddin as the new prime minister.
DIVERSITY
Although Mahathir's own rise in past decades was based on prioritizing what Malaysians refer to ""bumiputera"", the coalition he formed with more liberal old rival Anwar Ibrahim to win the 2018 election was unprecedented in its diversity.
The finance ministry went to someone of Chinese origin for the first time in four decades, and the attorney general's job to a man with Indian roots.
More than 40 percent of Mahathir's ministers were non-Malay Muslims. That compared to only a fifth in the cabinet of his ousted predecessor Najib Razak.
While celebrating its inclusiveness as a badge of modernizing reforms, the fallen government had not done enough to assuage the concerns of Malay Muslims, according to prominent social rights activist Ivy Josiah.
""We were so proud that non-Malays become ministers,"" she said. ""The government didn't realize the fragile relationship between the races, the insecurity of the Malay Muslim and how the opposition could use religion and race to divide.""
There had been plenty of warning signs.
The government was forced to drop a promise to ratify a U.N. convention on racial discrimination after protests by groups that feared it would limit privileges for ethnic Malays. The death of a Malay Muslim fireman at a Hindu temple became a rallying cry and brought accusations of a government cover-up.
This year, hardliners were annoyed when the government defended a Chinese school's right to put up New Year lanterns, complaining it was promoting foreign culture. There was also anger when the finance ministry began to issue statements in Chinese as well as Malay and English.
TRADITIONALISTS
""It’s not that this government will have no Chinese, but at least it will be more balanced,"" said Mohd Nor, echoing sentiment among Malays in the capital Kuala Lumpur.
Muhyiddin took office with the support of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), which prospered through six decades of putting Malays first, but was felled amid anger over corruption at the 1MDB state fund.
During the election campaign, Mahathir had said his administration would end handouts and that there would be greater transparency in awarding government contracts - which often went to Malays, but there was little sign of action.
""I think Muhyiddin would lead a more overtly pro-ethnic Malay government characterized by social division, economic nationalism, and possibly less fiscal restraint,"" said Peter Mumford of the Eurasia consultancy.
There is also a religious dimension to support for the Malay traditionalist camp.
According to the constitution, all Malays are Muslim. They make up more than 60 percent of the population. Most non-Malays are not Muslims.
Alongside UMNO in supporting Muhyiddin is the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), which has tried for decades to turn the country into an Islamic state and enforce harsher penalties on Muslims for adultery, theft and drinking alcohol.
""Malaysia's brief dalliance with political reform and social transformation has come crashing down,"" said Vatikiotis, saying he believed it resulted from the power struggle that flared between Mahathir and Anwar in the final week of chaos.
""It weakened the governing coalition and gave UMNO, PAS and the Malay right a chance to seize power through the back door."""

KASTANIES/LESBOS Greece (Reuters) - Migrants trickled through permeable borders to Greece from Turkey on Sunday, as thousands more gathered on the Turkish side seeking entry after Ankara relaxed curbs on their movement.
At least 220 people had arrived by sea on the Greek island of Lesbos on Sunday morning, a Greek defense ministry source said. 
Further north, groups waded across a river at Kastanies on the shared border.
Turkey said on Thursday it would no longer restrain hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers in its territory from reaching Europe, after an air strike on Idlib in neighboring Syria killed 33 Turkish soldiers. Its announcement triggered an almost instant rush to the borders it shares with European Union member Greece.
There was tension at Kastanies on Saturday after riot police used teargas to repel hundreds of migrants on the Turkish side demanding access to Greece.
""Yesterday there were 9,600 attempts to violate our borders, and all were dealt with successfully,"" deputy defense minister Alkiviadis Stefanis told Greece's Skai TV.
The International Organization for Migration put the number of people along the Greek-Turkish border at 13,000. By late Saturday, buses in Turkish cities were still being loaded with people bound for the border area, it said. 
Greece has said there was an orchestrated attempt on its borders, and has accused Turkey of actively guiding migrants. 
""Not only are they not stopping them, but they are helping them,"" Stefanis told Skai.
Greece was a gateway for hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers into Europe in 2015 and 2016. There are already more than 40,000 migrants on the Aegean islands, living in severely overcrowded camps and filthy conditions.
Last week, clashes broke out on Lesbos between riot police and locals to create closed detention centers to move the existing migrant population. Locals say the islands are suffering a disproportionate burden. 
The European Union said it was supporting Greece. 
Greece has vowed to keep a mass influx out. ""We don't want this influx in our country, this country is not a free-for-all,"" Migration Minister Notis Mittarachi told Greece's Ant1 TV. 
Reuters witnesses saw small groups of people making their way across fields outside the Greek town of Orestiada, close to the frontier. Four young Afghans, looking exhausted, sat around a small campfire.
Further along, Najibe Rezayi, 26, also from Afghanistan, cradled her seven-month daughter in her arms. ""We want a place to stay, food, warmth,"" she said through an interpreter as they walked through mist in frost-covered fields.
Police and the army have been arresting people who attempt to cross into the country.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israelis head to the polls on Monday with a sense of deja vu after trying and failing twice in the past year to break the country's political deadlock.
WHY SO MANY ELECTIONS?
In late 2018, Benjamin Netanyahu, veteran leader of Israel's right-wing Likud Party, seemed to be at the peak of his powers.
The dominant political figure of his generation, Netanyahu was about to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister.
But he had a precarious one-seat majority in parliament, and called a snap election for April 9, 2019.
The immediate reason given was the vulnerability of his ruling coalition after the resignation of Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman. More hawkish than even Netanyahu, Lieberman quit, accusing the prime minister of being too soft on Palestinian militants in Gaza.
But many Israelis saw it as a ploy by Netanyahu to gain a renewed public mandate to ward off prosecutors who were then in the final stages of drafting charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust against him.
Once re-elected, the theory went, Netanyahu could say an indictment was not in the national interest. He denies wrongdoing, accusing his enemies of a witch-hunt.
WHAT WENT WRONG?
If that was the plan, it backfired. No single party in Israel has ever won an outright majority in parliament, and Netanyahu failed to get enough seats.
He struggled for weeks to put together a government. Then, rather than let his principal rival - former armed forces chief Benny Gantz - have a chance to form a government, Netanyahu triggered another election, on Sept. 17.
WHAT HAPPENED IN ELECTION NUMBER TWO?
Again Netanyahu fell short. Likud and Gantz's centrist Blue and White Party ended in a virtual tie.
That left Lieberman a king-maker. But Lieberman cited policy differences with both men to avoid anointing either.
After months of horse-trading in which Netanyahu and Gantz both failed to win enough support, the outcome, much to the dismay of the jaded Israeli electorate, was Monday's election.
IS THIS TIME ANY DIFFERENT?
Yes. Since the previous election, formal criminal charges have been filed against Netanyahu. Prosecution is now a reality, not a possibility. His trial is due to open on March 17, just two weeks after the election.
Also, both previous elections were fought without the electorate knowing the contents of U.S. President Donald Trump's long-delayed Middle East peace plan.
That was published in January, and would grant U.S. recognition to Israel's settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Palestinians were furious, saying it gives away land they seek for a future state. Netanyahu pledged to annex the settlements after the election.
COULD NETANYAHU WIN THIS TIME?
Yes. But Netanyahu will need to win support from other parties if he is to form a coalition government with at least 61 of the parliament's 120 seats.
The court hearings will prompt rivals to demand that he resign, even before sentencing. A verdict is likely to be months away, and the appeals process could take years.
COULD NETANYAHU LOSE TO GANTZ?
Opinion polls have shown Liked and Blue and White virtually neck and neck, with Netanyahu's party edging slightly ahead in the final stages of the campaign.
Netanyahu is a known quantity. But Gantz also has problems - barring an unexpected surge in centrist voters he would have to bring together rightists and those representing Israel's Arab minority, which are on opposite sides of the political spectrum.
COULD THERE BE A FOURTH ELECTION?
Yes, if Monday's prolongs the deadlock. But some Israeli politicians regard this as unacceptable. Aside from political instability, it would mean further fiscal paralysis for Israel under a continuing caretaker government.
That could lead to the defection of some former Likud partners to a Gantz-led coalition.
WHAT ABOUT A ""NATIONAL UNITY"" GOVERNMENT?
Many Israelis would like Netanyahu and Gantz to unite, to end the bickering. But Gantz says he will not partner with Netanyahu now that an indictment has been filed.

Of the seven parties contesting the 63 lower house seats only one, the Social Democrats, has openly criticized the 67-year-old leader who wields sweeping powers in the Persian-speaking Muslim country of 9 million.
Another opposition group, the Islamic Renaissance Party, was outlawed shortly after the 2015 election - in which it failed to win any seats - as the authorities accused it of being behind a failed coup attempt.
The People's Democratic Party led by Rakhmon dominates the parliament which plans in the near future to move into a new building gifted by China, the main investor in Tajikistan's economy.
No large-scale polls indicating voter preferences were conducted before the vote, but few observers expect any change to the political status quo.
""The level of respect of fundamental freedoms has further deteriorated since the last elections and the choice between political alternatives is limited in the absence of independent media and a functioning opposition,"" the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said in a report last month.
The parliamentary election also appears to shed little light on Rakhmon's plans with regards to a presidential election this autumn when his seven-year term expires. The president has not said whether he plans to run again.
Neither of Rakhmon's two eldest children who are already prominent public figures is running in the election. His elder son Rustam Imomali is mayor of the capital Dushanbe and is eligible to run for the presidency. His daughter Ozoda Rakhmon serves both as presidential chief of staff and senator.

The Dushanbe government plans to announce the preliminary results of the vote on Monday.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has the resources to cope with a coronavirus outbreak, the director of its leading infectious diseases hospital said, defending detection procedures in the Southeast Asian nation of more than 260 million, where no cases have been reported.
The world's fourth most populous nation has tested 141 suspected cases, a small figure for its population, sparking concern among some medical professionals of a lack of vigilance and a risk of undetected cases.
Neighboring Malaysia has reportedly run about 1,000 tests, and Britain more than 10,000.    
""We can't doubt our skills and the facts we gather,"" said Muhammad Syahril, director of the Sulianti Saroso hospital in Jakarta, the capital, when asked why Indonesia had detected no cases.
""If we don't have cases, we don't have cases,"" he said in an interview at the hospital on Friday. ""Why would we cover it up?""
The virus has infected more than 85,000 people globally and killed nearly 2,800, the majority in China, spreading to more than 50 countries.
Sulianti Saroso is Indonesia's main hospital for handling suspected virus cases, among 135 designated for the task.
Indonesia's efforts have included screening the temperatures of arrivals at airports and advising that any who later become unwell should contact health authorities.
The hospital offers 11 isolation rooms for patients with symptoms such as pneumonia, Syahril said, adding that three people were being treated, while 21 were in isolation before testing negative.
The hospital was ready to tackle any outbreak, armed with experience gained in handling disease such as the 2003-2004 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), he said.
A health ministry official previously told Reuters that some hospitals, particularly in eastern Indonesia, had smaller capacity to handle virus cases. But even in Jakarta not all best practices appear to be followed and a recent visit to another hospital revealed some nurses without masks, despite attending to a patient with fever.
""BLESSING FROM THE ALMIGHTY""
Fuelling concern about Indonesia's vulnerability, four infections were confirmed in travelers who had spent time there, including a Japanese national living in Malaysia and one returning to New Zealand from Iran via the resort island of Bali.
Indonesian physician Shela Putri Sundawa worries that screening could miss potential carriers without symptoms.
""When people have travel or contact history, but they only have issues with coughing or minor fever, they'll just be monitored,"" she said, calling for tighter surveillance.
Tests were run when doctors determined that symptoms pointed ""to that direction"", Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto saidlast week.
""Imagine if everybody who had a cough or flu was checked, then millions would be checked,"" he said, adding that it was ""a blessing from the Almighty"" that no cases had been found.
Tests are done at a Jakarta laboratory run by the health ministry, but Sundawa said samples from outside the capital could take too long to arrive for optimal results.
Tests should also be cross checked with overseas laboratories accredited by the World Health Organization to dispel quality concerns, Arsul Sani, the vice chairman of the upper house of parliament, told Reuters.
The health ministry declined to comment but said its laboratory was accredited by the WHO.
Indonesia’s lack of confirmed cases ""may suggest the potential for undetected cases"" researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the United States said in a study this month.
They pointed to its direct air links with China's central city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.

Most of the South Korean patients were traced to a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southeastern city of Daegu. The church had a presence in Wuhan.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Churches were closed in South Korea on Sunday with many holding online services instead, as authorities fought to rein in public gatherings, with 376 new coronavirus infections taking the tally to 3,526 cases.
That came a day after the biggest daily jump of 813 cases in South Korea's battle with the largest virus outbreak outside China, said the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), which will update numbers later in the day.
The death toll of 17 was unchanged from Saturday, it added.
In Seoul, the capital, about a dozen worshippers were turned away from the Yoido Full Gospel Church, which put a sermon for its 560,000 followers on YouTube, filmed with a small choir instead of all 200 members and 60-strong orchestra.
""I had heard there would be no service, but just came to check as I live nearby, but yes, it is so empty,"" said one of them, Song Young-koo, as he left South Korea's biggest church.
""It's a wise decision to do it online, since the virus would easily spread at mass gatherings and churches can be no exception.""
Of the new cases, 333 were from the southeastern city of Daegu, the location of a church at the centre of the outbreak, and 26 from the nearby province of North Gyeongsang, KCDC said.
Health authorities have urged South Koreans to refrain from attending religious services and political events and stay indoors this weekend, warning of a ""critical moment"" in the battle on the virus.
For the first time in its 236-year history, South Korea's Catholic church decided to halt masses at more than 1,700 locations nationwide. Buddhist temples have also called off events, while major Christian churches held online services.
At Yongsan in central Seoul, a notice outside the large Samil Presbyterian Church advised parishioners all gatherings had been cancelled, with the parking area closed off.
HELP FOR NORTH KOREA
President Moon Jae-in called for unity and vowed greater efforts, including an extra budget, to fight the outbreak, in a speech for the 101st anniversary of a movement to win independence from Japanese colonial rule.
""The outbreak can threaten our lives temporarily, but it cannot break our unity and hope,"" Moon said in the speech.
Moon proposed joint efforts with North Korea to prevent an outbreak in the neighbour and improve healthcare.
North Korea has not confirmed any cases but imposed a month-long quarantine for those with symptoms, and state media said its leader, Kim Jong Un, held a meeting on stricter measures.
The crisis spooked trade and financial markets, leading Samsung Electronics (KS:005930),  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) and  LG Display  (KS:034220) to temporarily shut down a plant each and prompting boy band BTS to cancel a world tour set for April.
More neighbours suspended flights and banned visitors from South Korea.
In a statement, Seoul's foreign ministry said Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha asked Washington to avoid ""excessive action that could needlessly shrink exchanges between both countries,"" in a telephone call on Sunday with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun.
The request came after the United States advised Americans not to travel to hard-hit regions, such as Daegu."

BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovak opposition led by the Ordinary People party (OLANO) won an emphatic victory in the country's parliamentary election, as voters angry with graft routed the ruling centre-left Smer that has dominated the political scene for over a decade.
Results from 96.16% of voting districts showed on Sunday that OLANO, a politically amorphous, pro-European Union and pro-NATO movement focused on fighting corruption, took 24.95% of the vote, far ahead of the ruling Smer with 18.5%.
Support for OLANO surged in recent weeks, from less than 6% late last year, concentrating a protest vote fed by the murder of an investigative journalist and his fiancée two years ago.
Seats won by other liberal and conservative parties gave OLANO a strong position to lead negotiations to form a new centre-right government.
OLANO leader Igor Matovic has pledged to clean up politics, an ambition encapsulated in his party's slogan: ""Let's Beat the Mafia Together"".
""We take the result as a request from people who want us to clean up Slovakia. To make Slovakia a just country, where the law applies to everybody regardless if he is rich or poor,"" Matovic said after most of the votes were counted.
Matovic said he would reach out to leaders of three other parties - the liberal Freedom and Solidarity, the conservative For the People of former president Andrej Kiska, and the socially conservative, eurosceptic We Are Family - to form an alliance that would have constitutional majority of over 90 seats in the 150-seat parliament.
Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini from Smer acknowledged defeat and said the party's run in the office, for 12 out of the past 14 years, may be over.
""A probable departure of our party into opposition is not such a surprise,"" Pellegrini told reporters.
Smer scored its worst result since 2002. Its nationalist and Hungarian minority allies did not win any seats, the first time in decades that Hungarians will not be represented.
The political shift in the euro zone member state, which has avoided fights with Brussels unlike its central European Visegrad Group neighbors Hungary and Poland, started with the 2018 murder of journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée.
An investigation unearthed communications between a businessman now on trial for ordering the hit and politicians and judicial officials. The defendant has denied the charges.
The killing led to the biggest street protests in the post-communist era, forcing Smer leader Robert Fico to resign, though his party held on to power.
Matovic, 46, told Reuters last week he wanted to be a conciliatory voice toward the EU within Visegrad.
The former owner of regional newspapers and a lawmaker since 2010, Matovic calls himself a social conservative and economic liberal but refuses to pin down OLANO on the left-right or liberal-conservative scale.
In the European Parliament, OLANO is aligned with the centre-right European People's Party.
""I would like to send a positive signal,"" Matovic said, adding that he did not want European partners to feel Slovakia was a corrupt place ""where journalists and their fiancees are murdered just because someone unearthed corruption"".
He said he would strive for better education for the underprivileged Roma minority, and wanted the Roma, Hungarian and Ruthenian minorities to feel equal.
Predictions that the far-right, anti-EU and anti-NATO People's Party could make strong gains were not borne out and the party won just over 8%.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A former passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined off Japan for coronavirus died in a hospital in Perth early on Sunday, a health official said, becoming Australia's first death from the virus.
The 78-year-old man had been in quarantine since being evacuated from the cruise ship off Yokohama, one of more than 150 Australians taken off the vessel. 
""Our condolences are with his family and unfortunately he's the first death we've had from coronavirus in Australia,"" Andrew Robertson, the chief health officer of Western Australia state, told journalists.
The man's widow also caught the virus, but is in stable condition, the health official said. Australia's tally of virus infections rose by one to 26 on Sunday, the latest government figures showed.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a tweet that he was saddened to hear of the man's passing and the government would continue to do what it could to protect Australians from coronavirus. 
""We are monitoring and responding to the information we are receiving every day,"" Morrison tweeted. ""We are not immune, but we are as prepared as any country can be and we will get through this.""
On Saturday, Australia said it would deny entry to all foreigners traveling from Iran because of the spreading virus in the Islamic republic.

There have been more than 85,000 virus infections worldwide, the majority in China, the World Health Organization said. Outside China, it has spread to 53 countries, with more than 6,000 cases and 86 deaths.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Muhyiddin Yassin, a Malay nationalist politician backed by the corruption-tarnished former ruling party, was sworn in as prime minister on Sunday after the king picked him to replace 94-year-old Mahathir Mohamad.
The swearing-in capped a week of turmoil that began with Mahathir's resignation in an apparent bid to consolidate power, but ended with him sidelined and complaining of betrayal after decades dominating Malaysian politics.
Mahathir promised to seek a vote in parliament to challenge Muhyiddin's support, but conceded he might not win.
Muhyiddin, 72, was sworn in at a palace ceremony in front of Malaysia's king, Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, and promised to fulfil his duties as prime minister. 
The change in leadership comes less than two years after Mahathir joined old rival Anwar Ibrahim, 72, to defeat the ruling party of six decades, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), on an anti-corruption platform.
""This is a very strange thing,"" said Mahathir. ""This is the losers that will form the government,"" he added, referring to the outcome of the 2018 election.
He said he had the support of 114 of parliament's 222 members, but it was not guaranteed that they would all support him at a vote in a country of tangled political interests where horse-trading is commonplace.
Mathathir questioned whether a government involving the former ruling party would be as ready to pursue graft cases against its politicians. Those include former prime minister Najib Razak, who is now on trial for corruption.
A week of twists and turns in Malaysian politics began with Mahathir's resignation, breaking his alliance with Anwar as he proposed a national unity government without party loyalties that would have given him greater authority.
But Anwar then launched his own bid to become prime minister while Muhyiddin built his alliance.
KING'S CHOICE
It was down to the king to decide who would have the best chance to form a government. Although Mahathir and Anwar said they had reunited on Saturday and now had majority support, the king announced Muhyiddin as the candidate.
About 200 protesters gathered in Kuala Lumpur late on Saturday to protest against the king's decision. Police said they were investigating a Twitter post that encouraged people to join the protest, which they said was illegal.
Muhyiddin is from Mahathir's Bersatu party, but had shown himself ready to work with UMNO - from which he had been sacked in 2016 after questioning former prime minister Najib's handling of the 1MDB corruption scandal.
UMNO's fortunes have risen since its 2018 defeat, with the Pakatan coalition of Mahathir and Anwar losing five by-elections in the face of criticism from some Malay voters that it could do more to favor the biggest ethnic group in a nation of 32 million.
UMNO, which Mahathir led from 1981 to 2003 during a previous stint as prime minister, supports Malay nationalism.
""I think Muhyiddin would lead a more overtly pro-ethnic Malay government characterized by social division, economic nationalism, and possibly less fiscal restraint,"" said Peter Mumford of the Eurasia consultancy.

As well as personal relationships, politics in Malaysia is shaped by ethnic, religious and regional interests. Malaysia is more than half ethnic Malay, but has large ethnic Chinese, Indian and other minorities.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Mainland China reported 573 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Feb. 29, up from 427 the previous day and the highest daily increase in a week, the country's health authority said on Sunday.
The new cases were concentrated in Wuhan, the city where the virus is believed to have originated. Wuhan identified 565 new infections on Saturday, amounting to nearly 99% of the total. 
The number of mainland China deaths stood at 35, down from 47 on the previous day and the second lowest daily total in February. The total death toll in mainland China now stands at 2,870, the National Health Commission said.
Of the deaths, 34 were in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located and the epicenter of the outbreak, with the other in neighboring Henan. Hubei accounted for 570 of the new cases.
The three new cases outside Hubei are the lowest since the National Health Commission began compiling daily numbers on Jan. 20.
The commission also said a total of 41,625 patients had already been discharged, amounting to 52% of the total number of confirmed cases on the mainland, though officials have warned of the risks that some could again develop symptoms. 
In order to minimize the economic impact of the coronavirus, China has ordered all its regions to classify their districts into ""high-risk"", ""medium-risk"" and ""low-risk"", with the latter expected to end all traffic restrictions and allow everyone to return to work.
Hubei said on Saturday that 11 of its 103 counties had reported no new cases for at least 14 days, meeting the ""low-risk"" criteria. However, as many as 58 counties in the province are still deemed ""high-risk"".
Ying Yong, general secretary of the ruling Communist Party in Hubei, said on Saturday that there had been ""some positive changes"" but the situation was still at a critical stage, and the province could not yet ease restrictions on outbound travel. 
In speeches published on Sunday in Qiushi (Seeking Truth), the Communist Party's theoretical journal, President Xi Jinping said China needed to take a ""long-term view"" of the outbreak and plug ""loopholes"" in its laws and emergency response mechanisms.
He said China must establish an emergency reserve and supply system for vital materials in order to ensure they can be deployed at critical moments.

The World Health Organization said in its Saturday bulletin that there were 6,009 cases outside China, up 1,318 compared to the previous day. A total of 53 countries have now reported cases, it said, with Mexico and San Marino the latest additions to the list.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co has started calling back many of the 450 workers it laid off earlier this month in eastern Canada, when blockades crippled operations on strategic rail lines, according to a company email sent to customers on Friday.
Earlier this week, police made 10 arrests and cleared a blockade in eastern Canada that had been stopping freight and passenger traffic for almost three weeks on one of Canada's busiest lines.
The blockades were held in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en people in the Pacific province of British Columbia, who are seeking to stop TC Energy Corp from building a gas pipeline over their land.
""In the absence of illegal blockades on our network over the last 24 hours, and while we are keeping a close watch for any further disruptions, we have started calling back many of the temporarily laid off employees based in Eastern Canada,"" CN chief executive Jean-Jacques Ruest said in the email seen by Reuters.
The email did not specify how many of the 450 workers were being called back.
After 21 days of disruptions, ""there is a significant backlog of trains parked on our tracks and in our yards that will be processed,"" the email said.
""The complete network recovery process will take several weeks.""
Montreal-based CN said the company was on its way to recovering in Western Canada, and said products like export grain, imported containerized goods, coal, potash and other commodities are moving to market.
Canada relies on CN and rival Canadian Pacific Railway to move crops, oil, potash, coal and manufactured goods to ports and the United States. About half of Canada’s exports move by rail, according to industry data."

The left wing party's support jumped to 35%, ahead of Fianna Fail on 20% and acting Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael on 18% in a Sunday Times/Behaviour & Attitudes poll that may influence early talks between the two centre-right rivals.
Sinn Fein shocked the political establishment in an election earlier this month by securing more votes than any other party for the first time, almost doubling its vote to 24.5%, ahead of Fianna Fail on 22.2% and Fine Gael on 20.9%.
But it has been frozen out of government talks by its two rivals, who refuse to contemplate sharing power due to policy differences and Sinn Fein's history as the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, the militant group that fought against British rule in Northern Ireland in a conflict in which some 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace deal.
Caught by surprise themselves, Sinn Fein ran too few candidates to emerge with the most seats - a mistake it will not make next time around. It has already begun a series of packed national rallies to sure up its support.
Both Sinn Fein and Fianna Fail have 37 seats in the fractured 160-seat parliament, with Fine Gael on 35, meaning some sort of combination of two of the three largest parties is required to form a government.
Bruised by its election defeat, Fine Gael will reluctantly hold a ""one-day policy exchange"" with Fianna Fail next week as well as similar talks with the Green Party, whose 12 seats would be needed for the two historic rivals to reach a majority.
If Ireland's two dominant parties cannot agree to lead the next government while also maintaining their steadfast opposition to governing with Sinn Fein, a second election would be the only way to break the deadlock.
All sides predict talks will take a number of weeks before such a choice has to be made."

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds announced on Saturday they are expecting their first child together and are engaged to be married.
The couple have been living together in Downing Street since Johnson became prime minister in July, with Symonds the first unmarried partner to live openly with a British leader in recent history.
""The prime minister and Miss Symonds are very pleased to announce their engagement and that they are expecting a baby in the early summer,"" the couple said in a statement.
The 55-year-old Johnson took office in July and led his Conservative Party to a decisive election victory in December.
The announcement means he will become the first British prime minister to marry in office for 250 years.
The couple’s relationship was the subject of scrutiny during his bid to take over from Theresa May as prime minister last summer after police were called to Symonds’ home by a neighbor who heard an apparent row between them.
Symonds, 31, said in a message posted on Instagram that she had kept news of her engagement secret until now.
""I wouldn't normally post this kind of thing on here but I wanted my friends to find out from me,"" she said.
""Many of you already know but for my friends that still don't, we got engaged at the end of last year... and we've got a baby hatching early summer,"" Symonds said, adding: ""Feel incredibly blessed"".
Johnson was congratulated by members of parliament, including his former finance minister, Sajid Javid, who resigned after losing a power struggle over who should control Britain's economy.
""Wonderful news!,"" Javid said on Twitter.
THIRD MARRIAGE
Johnson, known for his rumpled appearance and flamboyant oratory, was previously married to Marina Wheeler, and they had four children together. They announced in September 2018 that they had separated and would divorce after 25 years of marriage.
The couple reached a financial settlement earlier this month, British media have reported.
Johnson has fathered one other child. He has always refused to say how many children he has. During the election campaign, Johnson said that he would not ""put them on the pitch"".
Johnson was married to Allegra Mostyn-Owen before Wheeler, so Symonds will be his third wife.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A Geneva court found a British lawyer guilty of defamation and attempted extortion for writing letters to Western intelligence services accusing his former client, a Russian-led oil trader, of financing terrorism.
An indictment presented to the court by a Geneva state prosecutor said that Matthew Parish, a 44-year-old Cambridge graduate, wrote in a letter to MI5 on April 27, 2018, that Integral Petroleum had close links to terrorist groups such as the Taliban and Islamic State.
Parish also accused the firm of using front companies to carry out what he called ""the greatest fraud in recent history"". The indictment said a dispute had arisen between the parties in 2017/2018 over legal bills that Parish said Integral owed him. Parish denied this, saying they fell out over employment terms.
In May 2018, he sent similar letters to U.S. and EU authorities, according to the indictment.
Late on Thursday, a spokesman for the Geneva prosecutor's office said: ""Mr. Parish is found guilty of defamation, calumny, a coercion attempt and of failing to conform with an authority's decision.""
He said Parish was ordered to pay a fine of 5000 CHF ($5,121) and the full costs of the proceedings and given a suspended sentence of one year in prison.
He was also instructed by the court to see a psychiatrist.
Reuters could not determine how the court reached its verdict. Geneva court rulings are only made public if an appeal is lodged and then only several weeks after the judgment.
David Bitton, lawyer for Integral and a plaintiff in the case, confirmed the verdict by telephone on Thursday. He did not respond to later requests for further comment.
Britain's interior ministry, which oversees the MI5 domestic intelligence agency, declined to comment. The foreign ministry said it was providing consular assistance to a British man in Switzerland, but gave no other details.
The EU commission did not provide any immediate comment. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment. The CIA and office of Director of National Intelligence did not respond to a request for comment.
Parish said he would appeal the verdict.
""How can you be found guilty of libel for informing enforcement bodies of crimes, without anyone completing an investigation as to whether those crimes have been committed?"" Parish said.
Reuters was unable to confirm whether an investigation had been carried out or was under way.
Bitton, the plaintiff and lawyer for Integral, said in court on Wednesday that Parish's actions warranted an ""especially harsh"" verdict.
Bitton told the court that Parish knew the allegations against Integral were false and that he made them in order to pressure the company to pay around 800,000 CHF ($781,000) in fees sought by Parish.
Several other parties, including another Swiss-based oil firm Petroforce Trading and Shipping and Integral's Russian CEO Murat Seitnepesov, also joined as plaintiffs in the case.
""Matthew Parish gravely damaged (Petroforce's) honor and it was essential for the firm that the defamatory nature of Mr. Parish's remarks be formally established,"" Marc Hassberger, one of Petroforce's lawyers, said on Saturday.
""This judgment fully satisfies my client.""
Petroforce and Seitnepesov joined the case because they were also named in the letters Parish sent to intelligence authorities in 2018, according to the indictment.
Integral Petroleum focuses on trading and logistics in the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus, Central Asia and Central America, according to its website. It is one of many commodity trading firms based in the Swiss city."

The Italian national, part of the same group as the four original cases at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace Hotel, has been in isolation in a hotel room since Feb. 24 and will be taken to hospital, the Canary Islands' regional health authorities said, adding the Italian was ""in good state of health"". 
It brings the total number of active cases in the Canary Islands to six - five in Tenerife and one in La Gomera. 
On Saturday, the fourth day of the hotel's lockdown, some of the 130 guests who had been cleared to leave on Friday were seen exiting its grounds with suitcases. 
More than 700 tourists remain inside waiting out a 14-day isolation period imposed on Wednesday. 
Hotel guest Christopher Betts, from Leicestershire in England told Reuters British tourists were being swabbed for the virus on Saturday, the first time they had been tested. They had previously been given thermometers to check their own temperatures. 
The Canary Islands regional government said on Friday guests could leave before completing the full 14-day isolation period if foreign governments could provide charter flights and guarantee isolation and health protocols.
British Ambassador to Spain Hugh Elliot said on Twitter that efforts were under way to support British nationals in the hotel and ""to plan for (their) safe return."" 

Spain's number of active coronavirus cases rose to 49 on Saturday. The bulk of those are linked to Italy, which has Europe's worst outbreak, with some 900 cases and 21 deaths.

The Empowerment Removal Committee was formed under a law introduced in November to dismantle the system built by Bashir, who was ousted in April last year after nearly three decades in power.
""One-hundred-and-nine ambassadors, diplomats and administrators were fired from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and those were appointed through political and social empowerment,"" Mohamed al-Faki, deputy head of the committee, told a news conference in the capital, Khartoum.

170,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 29, 2020 12:38PM ET</span>",France to push pension reform through parliament by decree to avoid vote,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government said on Saturday it would push President Emmanuel Macron's contested pension reform through parliament by decree, avoiding the need for a vote after the opposition filed more than 40,000 amendments to the draft law.
The reform, which is the single greatest overhaul of France's pension system since World War Two, prompted weeks of public sectors strikes and street protests before opponents of the legislation took the battle to parliament.
Macron loyalists, who hold a majority in the National Assembly, branded the mountain of amendments a cynical ploy to stall the pension bill's passage through parliament. 
""I have decided to engage the government's responsibility on the bill creating a universal retirement system, not to put an end to debate but to end this period of non-debate,"" Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told the lower house of parliament.
Catching lawmakers off-guard during the latest parliamentary session on the reform, Philippe's announcement was met with howls of protest from members of the far-left France Unbowed party that tabled most of the amendments. It responded by saying it would file a motion of censure against the government, which has next to no chance of passing in parliament.
""Though he puts on airs like a elegant, nonchalant dandy, the prime minister has extraordinarily violent methods,"" France Unbowed head Jean-Luc Melenchon told BFM TV.
The reform aims to merge 42 sector-specific pension regimes into a single points-based system, which Macron's government says would be more transparent while also ensuring a more sound financial footing as the population ages.
Philippe's government also wants to create incentives to make people work longer, notably by raising the age at which a person could draw a full pension to 64 while maintaining the legal retirement age at 62.

Unions and lawmakers argue that Macron's reform amounts to an attack on hard-earned benefits that help compensate for salaries below those in the private sector and will ruin public services.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police fired tear gas on Saturday to disperse hundreds of black-clad protesters, some armed with petrol bombs, during a rally to mark six months since the authorities stormed a subway station and arrested demonstrators.
One officer drew his gun but did not fire as protesters hurled plastic water bottles and umbrellas at him. 
The clashes are among the most violent in the Chinese-ruled city after a period of relative calm following intense anti-government protests that escalated in June last year, with fears over the coronavirus keeping many residents indoors.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in and around Mong Kok district and the Prince Edward subway station, where some of the fiercest violence erupted on Aug. 31, when police fired tear gas at pro-democracy protesters throwing petrol bombs.
Some chanted ""Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time,"" while others called for the police force to be disbanded, echoing slogans from previous demonstrations.
As the number of protesters increased, some set fires on Nathan Road in Kowloon district, sending plumes of thick, black smoke billowing into the air of the shopping hub, where police responded with pepper spray and tear gas. 
One demonstrator hurled a petrol bomb at a police vehicle but missed. Others set up road blocks. Mong Kok subway station was closed. 
The police said in a statement they had used ""minimum necessary force"" for dispersal and arrest operations and urged members of the public to leave the area immediately. 
PUBLISHING TYCOON'S ARREST
The scenes brought back images of the clashes that plunged the former British colony into turmoil last year and posed the gravest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
The arrest this week of publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, an outspoken critic of Beijing, on charges of illegal assembly thrust the protest movement back into the spotlight and drew condemnation from Washington and international rights groups. 
Lai has made financial contributions to Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrators. 
While there have been sporadic protests this year, they have been largely peaceful and a return to violent clashes will pose a significant challenge to embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam as she grapples to contain the spread of the coronavirus. 
The outbreak has piled pressure on Lam, in particular over her refusal to seal the border with mainland China, which has infuriated many residents who see it as a move to appease Beijing.
The protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.
China says it is committed to the arrangement and denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments including the United States and Britain of inciting the unrest. 
Protesters have called for an independent inquiry into the police force - one of five demands made on the Hong Kong government - amid allegations of excessive force.
Police say they have been restrained in the face of escalating violence.
The government announced in its budget this week that funding for the police force will reach HK$25.8 billion ($3.31 billion), up 25 percent from the previous year, drawing widespread criticism from democracy activists.
More than 7,000 people have been arrested in the anti-government protests, many on charges of illegal assembly or rioting, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.

At around 30km from the Spanish border, it is the closest Puigdemont has been to Spain since he fled the country in October 2017 after calling a referendum on independence. 
The referendum, which was declared illegal by Spanish courts, led to a short-lived declaration of independence by leaders in the restive northeastern region, plunging Spain into its biggest political crisis in decades. 
Puigdemont, who is now a member of the European Parliament and lives in exile in Belgium, urged supporters waving Catalan flags not to give up on the fight for an independent Catalonia. 
""We know that we won't stop and they won't stop us. We don't have to wait for better times because they are here,"" he said, to cheers from the crowd, which numbered around 70,000 according to local police, though organizers put the number closer to 150,000. 
""Today we have stepped on Catalan soil as free people,"" he said.
Perpignan, where Catalan is spoken, is a symbolic location for many Catalans, who call the region Northern Catalonia. 
Supporters poured into the city, many crossing the border from Spain. 
""Movements like this, with this magnitude, are always a positive thing,"" said entrepreneur Joan Candoll, 50. ""I see this as an act of unity, not a political campaign"". 
Puigdemont made no mention of talks on the Catalan political crisis, which began this week between Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Catalan regional President Quim Torra, who was due to attend the Perpignan rally. 

Puigdemont has been unable to return to Spain, where he is wanted on charges of sedition and misuse of public funds for his role in the failed independence bid. All extradition attempts by Spain have so-far failed, and he cannot be detained in France because of his MEP immunity.

The flurry of clashing appointments adds to the confusion that has reigned since the Dec. 29 presidential run-off in the small West African country.
It is unclear how the situation could develop. But the appointments suggest a continuation of the institutional chaos of the past five years, when then-president Jose Mario Vaz cycled through seven different prime ministers during a series of political disputes.
Further instability will weigh on the economy, which despite annual growth of around 5% is already hostage to the volatile price of cashew nuts that are the main income source for over two-thirds of households.
Embalo, whom the electoral commission has repeatedly confirmed as the winner, was sworn in on Thursday.
But the runner-up Domingos Simoes Pereira, whose PAIGC party holds the most seats in parliament, says the inauguration was illegitimate as the Supreme Court was still considering his party's request to annul the vote over alleged irregularities.
Late on Friday, lawmakers voted to appoint parliament leader Cipriano Cassama as interim president with those in favor arguing that Embalo's presidency was unlawful.
""As long as the Supreme Court has not made its decision, the PAIGC does not recognize Cissoko (Embalo) as a legitimate president,"" deputy leader of parliament Armando Mango said during the session.
The same evening Embalo issued a decree to sack prime minister and PAIGC veteran Aristides Gomes and his government. On Saturday, he swore in former presidential opponent Nuno Nabiam as his new prime minister.
""The country has passed recent years in a state of ungovernability, bad governance and general corruption,"" Embalo said during the ceremony in a speech that did not reference his stand-off with parliament.
""Today's ceremony marks the start of a new era.""
The population is weary of the crisis, but have different views on who is to blame. In central Bissau, student Isidro Teixeira, 30, said Embalo was the rightful president and the electoral commission's position should be accepted.
However 28-year-old carpenter Romulo Santos said Embalo had been inaugurated too soon: ""We are witnessing a coup because the Supreme Court has not yet ruled,"" Santos said."

Health Minister Olivier Veran said after a special cabinet meeting that the number of confirmed cases had risen to 73. Of those, two have died, 59 are in hospital, and 12 have recovered.
The move comes after Switzerland on Friday banned events expected to draw more than 1,000 people in a bid to curb the spread of the disease. 
Meanwhile in Italy schools and universities will stay closed for a second consecutive week in three northern regions in an effort to contain Europe's worst outbreak of the disease.

Greek police fired teargas to push back hundreds of migrants gathered on the border with Turkey on Saturday, as a crisis over Syria shifted onto the European Union's doorstep.
Ankara says it will no longer contain hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers after an air strike on Idlib in northwestern Syria killed 33 Turkish soldiers.
""We are in constant contact with our partners in the EU and along the western Balkan route. Should the protection of the EU's external borders not succeed, then Austria will protect its borders,"" Kurz, a critic of Turkey's government and a hawk on illegal immigration, said in a statement.
His comments hinted at a response similar to that of 2016 when he was foreign minister and Austria coordinated a series of border closures in Balkan countries between it and Greece to block a new wave of arrivals.
Kurz won power in 2017 after taking a hard line on immigration, pledging to prevent a repeat of 2015's influx, in which Austria took in the equivalent of about 1% of its population in asylum seekers. He formed a government at the time with the far right, which had a similar stance on the issue.
That conservative-far right coalition collapsed amid scandal in May and he now shares power with the left-wing Greens, though his government has maintained much of the previous coalition's stance on immigration.
""A situation like 2015 must absolutely not be repeated. Our aim must be to protect the EU's external borders properly, to stop illegal migrants there and not to wave them through,"" Kurz said.
Austria was ready to send extra police to countries on the border, he said, apparently referring to Greece and Bulgaria."

Polls suggest Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska, of the centrist Civic Platform party, would be just behind incumbent nationalist President Andrzej Duda if the second round of the vote was held today.
""I will be seeking friends not enemies for us, I will rebuild true partnerships with the EU and the United States,"" she told a rally in Warsaw.
""Our children are suffocating from smog and our government, instead of investing in clean technologies, invests in Russian coal and does not allow Poles to use European green money.""
Her rival Duda is allied to the ruling eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party which has clashed with Brussels over migration, climate change policies and other issues since coming to power in 2015.
It has also introduced judicial reforms which EU officials say may breach the bloc's standards on the rule of law. PiS says changes are needed to make courts more efficient and move the country on from its communist past.
PiS won a second term in October on the back of promises to raise living standards and make hefty social handouts.
But it lost control of the upper house, the Senate. The Senate can delay bills but only the president can block them - a fact that has raised the political stakes for May's presidential vote.
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, a member of PiS, gave a speech on Saturday accusing Kidawa-Blonska's Civic Platform party of failing to deliver on policy promises in the past.
According to opinion polls, Kidawa-Blonska would lose the first leg of the election scheduled for May 10, as the large number of opposition candidates diluted her support.
But they suggest she would be just 2 percentage points behind in the second, decisive leg of the vote two weeks later.
Analysts have said she appeals to both centrists and conservatives, and could still win over some undecided voters."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's 94-year-old Mahathir Mohamad lost out in the battle to become prime minister on Saturday as the king named former interior minister Muhyiddin Yassin after a week of political turmoil sparked by Mahathir's resignation.
The decision could again reshape politics in the Southeast Asian country less than two years after an alliance of Mahathir, and old rival Anwar Ibrahim, 72, swept out the former ruling party that had been tarnished by corruption scandals.
That former ruling party of six decades, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), was among those that had rallied in support of Muhyiddin, along with the Islamist party PAS.
Although Mahathir and Anwar announced on Saturday that they had joined hands again, the palace said in a statement the king made his decision on the basis that Muhyiddin, 72, possibly had the support of a majority in parliament.
""His majesty has decreed that the process of appointing a prime minister cannot be delayed,"" it added. ""This is the best decision for all.""
Muhyiddin, who will be sworn in on Sunday, urged all Malaysians to accept the palace's decision.
His position could still depend on being able to win a confidence vote in parliament, as Anwar said his coalition had now secured the support of 114 lawmakers, enough for a majority in the 222-member lower house of parliament.
Angered by the decision on Muhyiddin, around 200 people gathered in central Kuala Lumpur despite police warnings that the protest was illegal. Officers, however, stood on the sidelines without intervening.
""We’re really angry,"" said 23-year-old protester Atul Rabiatu. “UMNO-PAS is corrupt, it’s like going back to the old government and we don’t want that.""
One placard read: “Traitor to the people, Traitor to the country, NotMyPM”.
Nearby, a balloon seller said the new prime minister had been named by the king and should be given a chance. He did not want to give his name.
UMNO SPRINGS BACK
Muhyiddin is from Mahathir's Bersatu party, but had shown himself ready to work with UMNO - from which he had been sacked in 2016 after questioning former prime minister Najib Razak's handling of the 1MDB corruption scandal.
Najib is now on trial on corruption charges.
UMNO's fortunes have risen since its 2018 defeat, with Mahathir and Anwar's Pakatan coalition losing five by-elections in the face of criticism from some Malay voters that it should do more to favor the biggest ethnic group in the country of 32 million.
UMNO, which Mahathir led from 1981 to 2003 during a previous stint as prime minister, supports Malay nationalism.
""I think Muhyiddin would lead a more overtly pro-ethnic Malay government characterized by social division, economic nationalism, and possibly less fiscal restraint,"" said Peter Mumford, head of Southeast Asia coverage at risk consultancy Eurasia.
The latest crisis was triggered by a tussle for power between Mahathir and Anwar that has shaped Malaysian politics for two decades. Mahathir had promised to hand power to Anwar after the 2018 election, but no date had been set.
After resigning last Monday, Mahathir had sought to form a national unity government that would have given him greater powers, but he won little public support while Anwar rejected the plan and put himself forward for the premiership.
Anwar was Mahathir's deputy and a rising political star when Mahathir was prime minister the first time, but they fell out over how to tackle the Asian financial crisis.
Anwar was arrested and jailed in the late 1990s for sodomy and corruption, charges he says were politically motivated.

As well as personal relationships, politics in Malaysia is shaped by a tangle of ethnic, religious and regional interests. Malaysia is more than half ethnic Malay, but has large ethnic Chinese, Indian and other minorities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will continue to work with Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan until they sign an accord on a giant Blue Nile hydropower dam, after failing to secure signatures from the three countries this week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday.
The three countries had expected to sign an agreement in Washington this week on the filling and operation of the $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), but Ethiopia skipped the meeting and only Egypt has initialed the deal thus far.
In a statement released late Friday, Mnuchin said he held separate bilateral talks with key ministers from Egypt and Sudan over the past two days after Ethiopia asked for a delay in what was to be the final round of talks.
Ethiopia on Saturday expressed its disappointment at the U.S. statement following the talks. The government is, however, ""committed to continue its engagement"" with Egypt and Sudan to finalize an agreement on the initial filling and annual operation of the dam, it said in a statement. 
It was not immediately clear whether further talks would be scheduled.
Mnuchin said he looked forward to Ethiopia concluding its internal consultations to allow a signing of the deal ""at the earliest possible time"", and stressed that final testing and filling of the dam ""should not take place without an agreement.""
""The United States reaffirms its commitment to remain engaged with the three countries until they sign the final agreement,"" he said.
Ethiopia is building the dam near its border with Sudan on the Blue Nile, which flows into the Nile river - the main water source for Egypt's population of 100 million. The dam is the centrepiece in Ethiopia's bid to become Africa's biggest power exporter.
At last month's talks in Washington, the nations agreed on a schedule for staged filling of the dam and mitigation mechanisms during dry periods and drought, but said they still needed to finalize details on safety and how to resolve any disputes.
Mnuchin said the agreement hammered out over the past four months with input from the countries and the World Bank ""addresses all issues in a balanced and equitable manner."" 
Egypt was ready to sign the agreement and had initialed it, but Ethiopia continued its national consultations, Mnuchin said.
Downstream populations in Sudan and Egypt remained concerned about unfinished work on the safe operation of the dam, he said.
Egypt's foreign ministry said in a statement that Cairo looked forward to Sudan and Ethiopia following its lead in accepting the agreement and signing it soon.
""It is a fair and balanced agreement that achieves the common interests of the three countries,"" Egypt said. It said it ""regrets Ethiopia's unjustified absence from this meeting at this crucial stage of the negotiations.""
Sudan reaffirmed its commitment to the negotiation process, its ministry of irrigation and water resources said in a statement.

""Sudan also emphasizes the importance of reaching a comprehensive agreement including safe operation of the GERD prior to commencing of the initial filling,"" the statement added.

PODGORICA (Reuters) - Thousands of people, led by Serbian Orthodox Church clerics, marched peacefully through the Montenegrin capital Podgorica on Saturday in protest against a law they fear will be used to target the church's assets and status.
Protests have been under way since December following the adoption of a law which allows the state to take over the property of a religious community if it cannot prove it owned it before 1918 - when the-then Kingdom of Montenegro joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes that preceded Yugoslavia.
The Serbian Orthodox Church is the largest denomination in Montenegro, a tiny Balkan country of 620,000 people. The Church has about 12 million followers, mainly in Serbia, Bosnia and Montenegro. 
The marchers were led by Metropolitan Amfilohije of Montenegro and Onufriy, the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church that is loyal to the Patriarchate in Moscow and priests who chanted hymns. They also waved Serbian flags and church banners, and halted at one point to say prayers. 
""When they (the government) ... started snatching people's soul, the churches and religious sites ... then the people stood up,"" said Matija Spasojevic, 24, from the northern city of Niksic.
Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic accused Serbia and Russia on Friday of using the Orthodox Church to undermine his country's independence, NATO membership and its attempt to join the European Union. Belgrade and Moscow dismissed the accusations, made in an interview with Reuters.
Bishop Joanikije, the head of a diocese in Montenegro's north, told Reuters this week that the law ""contains elements of discrimination (against the Serbian Orthodox Church) in comparison to other property owners in Montenegro."" 
The Serbian Orthodox Church, which had a role in fomenting the nationalism that contributed to the bloody collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, sees Montenegro as its medieval cradle and owns churches, monasteries and other property there.
Joanikije said that although the Serbian Orthodox Church, has attempted to distance itself from politics in Montenegro, the clergy and faithful ""have the right to a say."" 
""This (protest) is about religious and property rights ... about the dignity and the right to existence,"" he said.
Ethnic Serbs account for around a third of Montenegro's population. Many Serbians have roots and families in Montenegro, while tens of thousands of Montenegrins reside in Serbia.
""Firstly, I am a Serb and only then a Montenegrin,"" said Dragomir Drobnjak, 67, a pensioner from Podgorica.
Serbia and Montenegro are both negotiating entry to the EU but Belgrade is not seeking membership in the defense alliance.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday that he had asked President Vladimir Putin for Russia to step aside in Syria and leave Turkey to deal with Syrian government forces alone, after 34 Turkish soldiers were killed this week.
Government forces, backed by Russian air power, have waged a major assault to capture the northwest province of Idlib, part of the last remaining territory held by rebels backed by Turkey.
Syrian and Russian warplanes on Saturday kept up air strikes on the Idlib city of Saraqeb, the Syrian Observatory war monitor reported. The strategic city sits on a key international roadway and has been a flashpoint of fighting in recent days.
Turkish strikes using drones and smart missiles late on Friday that hit Hezbollah headquarters near Saraqeb killed nine of its members and wounded 30 in one of the bloodiest attacks on the Iran-backed group in Syria, according to a commander in the regional alliance backing Damascus.
The Syrian Observatory said 48 pro-Damascus troops had been killed by Turkish strikes in the past 24 hours.
With diplomacy sponsored by Ankara and Moscow to ease tensions in tatters, Turkey has come closer than ever to confrontation with Russia on the battlefield.
Speaking in Istanbul, Erdogan said he had told Putin in a phone call to stand aside and let Turkey ""do what is necessary"" with the Syrian government. He said Turkey does not intend to leave Syria right now.
""We did not go there because we were invited by (Syrian President Bashar al-Assad). We went there because we were invited by the people of Syria. We don't intend to leave before the people of Syria say, 'Okay, this is done,'"" Erdogan added.
As tensions rose, Russia and Turkey have held three rounds of talks, the first two of which did not yield a ceasefire. 
Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that the two sides agreed in this week's talks to reduce tensions on the ground in Idlib while continuing military action there.
But Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters in Doha that the Idlib issue can only be settled in a meeting between Erdogan and Putin, which he said would take place on March 5 or March 6.
MIGRANTS
After 33 of its soldiers were killed on Thursday, Turkey said it would allow migrants it hosts to freely pass to Europe. One more Turkish soldier was killed on Friday, raising this month's toll to 55.
Turkey hosts some 3.7 million Syrian refugees, in addition to Afghans, Iranians, and Moroccans among others. It has warned that it cannot take another refugee wave from Idlib.
Violence in the northwestern Syrian province has displaced one million civilians since December inside the country near the Turkish border in desperate winter conditions, in what is perhaps the worst humanitarian crisis of the conflict.
Erdogan said that 18,000 migrants has crossed the border to Europe from Turkey since the gates were opened, without providing evidence, and added that the number could rise to 25,000-30,000 on Saturday.
Greece and Bulgaria, both European Union member states neighboring Turkey, vowed not to admit the migrants. Greek police fired teargas toward migrants who were gathered on its border with Turkey and demanding entry on Saturday.
""We will not close these doors in the coming period and this will continue. Why? The European Union needs to keep its promises. We don't have to take care of this many refugees, to feed them,"" Erdogan said.
He said funds transferred to Turkey from the EU to support refugees were arriving too slowly and that he had asked German Chancellor Angela Merkel to send them directly to the Turkish government.
Turkey's borders to Europe were closed to migrants under an accord between Turkey and the EU that halted the 2015-16 migration crisis when more than a million people crossed into Europe by foot.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said he was planning to host a high-level meeting in Bulgaria to seek long-lasting solutions for Syria and migrants and would meet Erdogan on Monday to discuss it. 
He said there was currently no migration pressure on the Balkan country's border with Turkey. 

""We have to do everything possible next week, very quickly, until Wednesday, Thursday at the latest, to provide Turkey with the necessary means so that it can take the migrants back and take care of them,"" he told reporters.

The annual march is the first major demonstration organized by Russia's political opposition since President Vladimir Putin proposed a raft of changes to the constitution last month.
The proposals, widely seen as a means to allow Putin to extend his grip on power after leaving the presidency, will be put to a national vote on April 22.
Over 22,000 people rallied for Saturday's march in a square around 2 kilometers (1.24 miles) from the Kremlin, according to White Counter, a monitoring organization that tallies up participants at rallies using metal detector frames.
Demonstrators carried photos of Nemtsov and posters reading ""No to eternal Putin"" and ""No to the usurpation of power"".
Sergei Tsaplienko, an energy worker, said he was joining the march because he wanted freedom and democracy for the Russian people.
""I haven't got the strength to stand the government's abuses of power,"" he said. ""The constitution is about to be transformed into some sort of comic strip.""
Moscow city authorities granted official permission for the march to be held, unlike several unsanctioned protests in the capital last summer that, at their peak, drew around 60,000 people and led to thousands of detentions.
Organizers said that linking the commemorative march with a protest against constitutional reform was consistent with the ideas of Nemtsov, who was one of Putin's most vocal critics.
""This is exactly what Boris Nemtsov was fighting for, and he gave his life for it,"" organizers wrote on the event's web page.
Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, was killed in 2015 as he walked home across a bridge near the Kremlin's walls. He had been working on a report examining Russia's role in the conflict in Ukraine.
His allies have criticized the subsequent investigation for failing to identify who ordered the killing, though five men were given jail sentences.
Saturday's protest featured a banner calling on the authorities to find and prosecute those who orchestrated the killing.
The call was echoed by a representative of the U.S. embassy in Moscow earlier this week, during a visit by foreign diplomats to Nemtsov's memorial."

KABUL/DOHA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo landed in Qatar's capital city, Doha on Saturday to witness the signing of a historic deal with Taliban insurgents in an effort to end the 18-year war in Afghanistan.
Pompeo arrived on a flight from Washington and was due to hold a meeting with the Qatari Emir before attending the signing ceremony.
The deal paves the way for the United States to gradually withdraw its troops from Afghanistan. But there are doubts over whether it will lead to a lasting peace as it merely paves the way for talks between the Afghan sides that many expect could be much more complicated.
Hours before the deal, the Taliban ordered all its fighters in Afghanistan ""to refrain from any kind of attack ... for the happiness of the nation.""
""The biggest thing is that we hope the U.S. remain committed to their promises during the negotiation and peace deal,"" said Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline Islamist group.
Mujahid said it was ""irritating and provocative"" that foreign military aircraft continued to fly over Taliban territory, but militia fighters were following the order to stand-down.
'MONUMENTAL DAY'
Millions of Afghans are hoping that the deal could pave the way for an end to America's longest war, fought in their country.
The war, which has killed tens of thousands of people, began when the United States launched attacks on Afghanistan just weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington by the Afghanistan-based al Qaeda militant group. 
Washington accused the Taliban of harboring al Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden, and with its allies ousted the group from power. But the Taliban has remained a potent force and currently controls about 40% of Afghan territory.
For U.S President Donald Trump, the deal represents a chance to make good on his promise to bring U.S. troops home. But security experts have also called it a foreign policy gamble that would give the Taliban international legitimacy.
""Today is a monumental day for Afghanistan,"" the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said on Twitter. ""It is about making peace and crafting a common brighter future. We stand with Afghanistan.""
A 31-member Taliban delegation was in Qatar to oversee the signing by their political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. 
Foreign ministers and bureaucrats from Pakistan, Indonesia, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan arrived at the venue ahead of the signing ceremony, slated to take place at the Sheraton hotel in Doha.
Trump said in a statement on Friday said the deal will pave way for U.S. troop numbers to drop to 8,600 from about 13,000 in the weeks following the deal. 
Further reductions of Western forces will hinge on the Taliban adhering to a ""reduction in violence"" pledge, a condition that will be assessed by the United States.
'MY COUNTRY DESERVES IT'
For millions of Afghans, the deal represents some hope for an end to years of bloodshed.
""Peace is extremely simple and my country deserves it. Today is the day when maybe we will see a positive change,"" said Javed Hassan, 38, a school teacher living on the outskirts of Afghan capital, Kabul.
Hassan's children were killed in a bomb blast carried out by the Taliban in 2018. Since then, he has been writing letters to world leaders urging them to end the Afghan war.
But prospects for peace remain uncertain given the next step is reaching agreement with the Afghan government.
U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper arrived in Kabul on Saturday, in a move officials and experts said was aimed at reassuring the Afghan government about the United States' commitment to the country.
Under the deal, the Taliban wants 5,000 fighters to be released from Afghan-run jails, but it is not clear whether the Afghan government will agree.
There are also questions about whether Taliban fighters loyal to hardline Islamist splinter groups will be willing to adhere to the reduction in violence agreement.
Some senior commanders of the Taliban who arrived in Doha for the signing said they will ensure that the U.S. and Afghan governments accept all the conditions laid down by the group, according to Afghan defense officials.

Sources in the Taliban earlier this month said they were prepared to launch a spring offensive and had recruited more than 6,000 fighters and suicide bombers if the agreement collapses.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Deaths in Iran from coronavirus have hit 43, the highest number outside China, and the total number of infected people has risen to 593, an Iranian health official said on Saturday.
As several countries in the Middle East reported cases of the coronavirus stemming from Iran, the country is at the epicenter of the outbreak in the region. 
""Unfortunately nine people died of the virus in the last 24 hours, increasing the death toll to 43 ... the total number of infected people is 593,"" Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur told state TV, calling on people to stay at home. 
Iran's Health Minister Saeed Namaki warned on Friday of ""a very difficult week"" ahead in Iran, which only announced its first infections and deaths from the coronavirus on Feb. 19 and where the death rate among confirmed cases has been around 10%, compared to around 3% elsewhere. 
Tehran has ordered the shutting of schools until Tuesday and the government has extended the closure of universities and a ban on concerts and sports events for a week. 
Several high-ranking officials, including a vice minister, deputy health minister and five lawmakers, have tested positive for the coronavirus as outbreak forced Iran's clerical rulers to close the parliament and impose internal travel bans.
One lawmaker, elected in Iran's Feb. 21 polls, had died of the coronavirus, Iranian media reported on Saturday.
Iran's government spokesman will hold his weekly news conference online due to the outbreak, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. 
Iran's foreign ministry advised Iranians to avoid trips to South Korea, which reported 594 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, taking its tally to 2,931 cases.
Saudi Arabia is now the only Gulf Arab state not to have reported any cases of the coronavirus, which has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,800, mostly in China.
""This is an international problem and all nations should work together to overcome the coronavirus crisis,"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told Qatar’s ruler Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani on Saturday by telephone, state TV reported.
However, Iran has rejected as ""ridiculous"" the U.S. offer to help with its coronavirus outbreak.
Tensions have been high between Tehran and Washington since 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers and reimposed sanctions which have battered the Islamic Republic's economy.

Iranian authorities said the U.S. sanctions were hampering Tehran's ability to get medical supplies from other countries, something which Washington has denied.

KASTANIES, Greece (Reuters) - Greek police fired teargas towards migrants gathered on its border with Turkey on Saturday, as a crisis over Syria shifted onto the European Union's doorstep.
Greece, which has tense relations with its neighbor Turkey at the best of times and was a primary gateway for hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers in 2015 and 2016, reiterated it would keep migrants out.
""The government will do whatever it takes to protect its borders,"" government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters.
Ankara said on Thursday it will no longer contain hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers after an air strike on war-ravaged Idlib in Syria killed 33 Turkish soldiers.
Almost immediately, convoys of people appeared heading towards the Greek land and sea borders. 
""This has nothing to do with Idlib,"" Petsas said, adding that in the past 24 hours Greek authorities had prevented attempts by 4,000 people to cross the border.
Greece's Skai TV aired live video from the Turkish side of the northern land border at Kastanies showing Greek riot police firing teargas rounds at groups of migrants who were hurling stones and shouting obscenities. 
A Reuters witness said there were about 500 people in the buffer zone between the two border posts, and beyond that on the Turkish side hundreds more. 
Overnight, demonstrators hurled flaming pieces of wood at police, amateur footage filmed by a police official on the scene, which was seen by Reuters, showed. 
An estimated 3,000 people had gathered on the Turkish side of the border at Kastanies, a Greek government official said. Kastanies is just over 900 km (550 miles) north-east of Athens.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday that some 18,000 migrants had crossed borders from Turkey into Europe. Speaking in Istanbul, he did not immediately provide evidence for the number, but said it would rise.
Greek police were keeping media about a kilometer away from the Kastanies border crossing, but the broader area, where the two countries are divided by a river, was more permeable.
A group of Afghans with young children waded across fast-moving waters of the Evros river and took refuge in a small chapel. They crossed into Greece on Friday morning.
""Today is good"" said Shir Agha, 30 in broken English. ""Before, Erdogan people, police problem,"" he said. Their shoes were caked in mud. It had rained heavily the night before, and by early morning, temperatures were close to freezing.
Greece had already said on Thursday it would tighten border controls to prevent coronavirus reaching its Aegean islands, where thousands of migrants are living in poor conditions.

Nearly a million refugees and migrants crossed from Turkey to Greece's islands in 2015, setting off a crisis over immigration in Europe, but that route all but closed after the European Union and Ankara agreed to stop the flow in March 2016.

Rutnam, who has worked the government for 33 years, took the unusual step of making a statement outside his home alleging Patel was behind the campaign to oust him.
""In the last ten days I have been the target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign,"" he told reporters.

""But despite my efforts to engage with her, Priti Patel has made no efforts to engage with me to discuss this,"" he said.
Rutnam said that this gave him ""very strong claims"" for constructive dismissal, which he would be pursuing in the courts. He added while his experience was ""extreme"", it was part of a ""wider pattern"" in government.

Luca Zaia has pinned the blame on China for the flare-up in Italy, which has led to at least 21 deaths, saying that unlike Italians, the Chinese did not have good standards of hygiene.
""The hygiene that our people, the Venetians and the Italian citizens have, the cultural training we have, is that of taking a shower, of washing, of washing one's hands often,"" Zaia said in a Antenna 3-Nord Est TV television interview on Friday.
""It is a cultural fact that China has paid a big price for this epidemic because we have seen them all eat mice live or things like that.""

This is a gratuitous attack that leaves us stunned,"" it wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Political opponents of Zaia also denounced his comments, saying they would damage ties between the two countries. The Veneto governor, who is a member of the rightist League party, said had not meant to cause offence.
""My words came out badly, I agree. If anyone was offended, I am sorry,"" he told Corriere della Sera newspaper on Saturday. ""I wanted to say that when it comes to food health and safety, controls change from country to country.""
The new coronavirus emerged at the end of 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan where scientists believe it might have passed to humans from animals at a local market where bats, snakes and other wildlife were sold. China temporarily shut down all such markets in January, warning that eating wild animals posed a threat to public health and safety.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, who has been suffering from what the Vatican says is a ""slight indisposition,"" resumed official audiences with individuals in his residence on Saturday but three with groups were canceled.
A statement said the pope, who had canceled most official audiences on Thursday and Friday, celebrated his customary early morning Mass in the chapel of the Santa Marta guest house where he lives.
He was then holding four separate official audiences there on Saturday morning with Church figures, including three with archbishops from outside Italy. Three larger audiences with groups were canceled.
All of Saturday's official audiences were to have taken place in the Apostolic Palace. Those with individuals were moved to his residence.
The Vatican has not specified what the 83-year-old Roman Catholic leader is suffering from.
On Friday afternoon spokesman Matteo Bruni moved to dismiss speculation that the pope was anything more than slightly unwell, saying ""There is no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition.""
At his general audience on Wednesday he appeared to have a cold and spoke with a slightly hoarse voice, and he coughed during an afternoon Ash Wednesday service in a Rome church, his last appearance outside the Vatican.
In the past few days since the pope was taken ill, he has continued his afternoon working meetings in the residence.
Francis is missing a part of one lung. It was removed when he was in his early 20s in his native Buenos Aires after an illness.
The pope is due to preside at his regular noontime prayer and message on Sunday. On Sunday afternoon, he and senior Vatican officials will go by bus to a Church residence south of Rome for their annual week-long Lenten spiritual retreat.

Honcharuk declined comment. 
Zelenskiy has convened a special parliament meeting on Wednesday, which Ukrainian media reported could include discussions on government personnel changes.
Replacing Honcharuk would come at a time when confidence in Zelenskiy's government has fallen. The former actor and comedian won a landslide election victory last year promising to end the war in the Donbass and tackle corruption.
Deputy Prime Minister Denys Shmygal could be made acting prime minister while a permanent replacement was found, NV said.
Honcharuk last week denied he had submitted his resignation or discussed his departure with Zelenskiy, but his position has been under scrutiny since the leak in January of a recording that suggested he had made unflattering comments about Zelenskiy.
Zelenskiy himself acknowledged meeting Serhiy Tihipko, a businessman and veteran politician who was touted in the Ukrainian media as a potential replacement for Honcharuk. 
Any reshuffle would come just as Ukraine is trying to secure the release of billions of dollars in loans from the International Monetary Fund, which is contingent on Kiev's progress in passing reforms and tackling graft. 
Zelenskiy has also prioritized ending the war in Donbass but while he has implemented some confidence-building measures with Russia, including prisoner swaps, the conflict simmers on.
Ukrainians' confidence in the government's ability to tackle key issues has waned, a report by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology showed last week.
Only 25% of Ukrainians think the authorities have been successful in resolving the Donbass conflict compared to 40% in December, it said. About 83% said the fight against high-level corruption had been unsuccessful compared to 76% in December.
Support for Honcharuk fell to 8% from 12% over the same period, while 33% have a negative view of him now. 

In Ukraine, it is parliament that has the power to appoint and fire the prime minister and the government. Zelenskiy's Servant of the People party has a majority in the chamber, meaning Zelenskiy could sack Honcharuk without needing the approval of other political parties.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Annie had been ready to leave her home city of Hong Kong and return to South Korea for the spring semester when her university told her she was required to self-quarantine for 14 days in a dormitory room upon arrival.
The short journey from the Incheon international airport to her school campus in the same port city just west of Seoul was not easy, as taxis shunned customers deemed to be coming from China, where the coronavirus outbreak began.
""I was rejected twice by taxis after they asked me where I came from,"" the 19-year-old sophomore at Yonsei University told Reuters via a video clip from the room where she is isolated.
""It didn't feel nice obviously, but I know they wanted to be secure, they're scared as well, so I'm not taking it personally.""
South Korea is grappling with the largest outbreak of the virus outside China, and recorded the biggest daily jump in infections on Saturday, with 594 new cases for the tally of 2,931.
Most of South Korea's cases were traced to a local church. But the expected arrival of some 70,000 Chinese students for the upcoming semester has stoked fears over a wider transmission, prompting more than 760,000 South Koreans to sign a petition calling for a blanket entry ban for China.
Annie, who only gave her first name due to privacy concerns, said she was given a mask and a thermometer with which to take her temperature every day before reporting to security officials there.
In the video, she showed a small room with bunk beds, desks and chairs for four people. As she opened the door, a lunch package was left outside, consisting of a sandwich, an orange, a bag of nuts, a bottle of fruit juice and mineral water.
The school also provides basic supplies including toiletries, she said.
The university has said the self-quarantine policy is in line with government guidelines that apply to several other countries where infections have been confirmed, including Japan, Vietnam and Thailand.
The isolation, perceived discrimination and uncertainty surrounding school schedules, have led Annie to decide to take leave for a semester and go back home, she said.
""I feel like if I really stay here for another four months, problems like that will happen every day because it already happened in the first hour that I arrived,"" she said, referring to taxis avoiding some passengers.

""During a phone call earlier today on migration and the current war situation in Syria, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan informed PM Orban that there is enormous pressure on Turkey and that they can no longer hold back the flow of migrants,"" the government's press office said in a statement late on Friday.
Orban convened a meeting of his security cabinet which decided that ""Hungary must strengthen the protection of its borders and pay special attention to developments on the Balkan migration route.""
Refugees in Turkey headed towards European frontiers on Friday after an official said the borders had been thrown open, a response to the escalating war in Syria where 33 Turkish soldiers were killed by Russian-backed Syrian government troops.
The EU said that Ankara had made no formal announcement of any change in policy at the border.
One of the most vociferous opponents of Muslim immigration into Europe, Orban won a third term in power in 2018. During the peak of the migration crisis in 2015 he had effectively sealed Hungary's southern border with a fence. Hungary was a transit route for hundreds of thousands of migrants heading through the Balkans to western Europe.
Turkey's neighbors Greece and Bulgaria, both European Union member states, vowed not to admit the migrants and reinforced their borders following Ankara's threat to reopen the frontier.
It was closed under an accord between Turkey and the European Union that halted the 2015-16 migration crisis when more than a million people crossed into Europe by foot."

CIUDAD JUAREZ/EL PASO (Reuters) - U.S. authorities said they closed the busy Ciudad Juarez-El Paso border bridge on Friday after more than a hundred mostly Cuban migrants tried to cross in response to a court ruling suspending an asylum policy.
Earlier, an appeals court ruled to block one of President Donald Trump's signature immigration policies the administration says has helped to curb migration on the southern border and forced tens of thousands to wait in Mexico.
Word of the news spread on social media and a Reuters witness saw migrants on the Mexican side of the border heading towards the bridge while some U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers were putting on riot gear.
""I've been waiting in Juarez for ten months,"" said one Cuban asylum seeker, who declined to give his name. ""I don't care how long I have to wait here for them to let us through.""
CBP confirmed on its Twitter account that it had closed the Paso Del Norte Bridge to stop a group of migrants from illegally and forcefully entering the United States and that other ports stayed open.
The policy has forced roughly 60,000 people back to Mexico under one of Trump's asylum policies, called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), to await the outcome of their cases in often dangerous border towns.
There, they are vulnerable to kidnapping, rape, robbery and other crimes while living in sometimes unsanitary conditions.
Later on Friday, the Trump administration said in an emergency motion that at least 25,000 migrants sent back through the program were still in Mexico and that halting the program ""could prompt a rush on the southern border"".
In response, the appeals court put its ruling on hold to allow the administration to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the issue.
""It's time for everyone to start going home, no one is going to cross tonight,"" said Enrique Valenzuela, head of the population council of the Chihuahua state government, whose is among those in charge of handling migrants at the border.
""The suspension has been suspended, MPP is back,"" he told migrants as he walked through the crowd at the base of the bridge.
Even though some migrants left, dozens were still present when CBP tweeted the bridge would remain closed overnight."

KABUL (Reuters) - For mother-of-four Nasima, the prospect of lasting peace in Afghanistan is almost too good to be true.
The 45-year-old, whose husband Nasir Ahmad was killed in a massive truck bomb in Kabul blamed on Taliban insurgents, is one of thousands of grieving relatives in the war-weary country who look upon a promised peace deal with skepticism as well as hope.
Afghanistan has been at war for decades. The Soviet invasion dominated the 1980s, civil war followed, the hardline Islamist Taliban movement held sway for a few years before being ousted in a U.S.-led assault, followed by 18 more years of conflict.
Tens of thousands of civilians, insurgents, Afghan security personnel and foreign troops have died, and loved ones will look on Saturday's planned deal between the United States and the Taliban with mixed feelings.
""Anyone who can carry out such a brutal attack, how can I believe that they will let others live in peace?"" Nasima asked, speaking in her Kabul apartment surrounded by her children.
But she would at least try to move on if the attacks really stopped.
""If they (the Taliban) are serious about getting together for real peace, I am ready to forgive the suffering they caused me and my family.""
The weekend agreement in Doha on an American troop withdrawal is connected to a wider push for reconciliation between the Taliban and the Afghan government, although major obstacles to lasting peace remain.
One is the lack of trust between sides who blame each other for the heavy toll of war.
HORROR IN ATTACK'S AFTERMATH
Nasima's husband left home early one morning in late May, 2017, in search of work so that he could afford to bring home ""iftar"", an evening meal served during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. He had not found a job for a few days.
""A day before I had asked him about whether he found a job; he told me there were shops whose display windows needed cleaning for Ramadan and he was confident he'd find work if he got there early,"" Nasima recalls.
At around 8:30 a.m., she heard a loud blast. Such was the intensity of the explosion that it shook the entire city.
The truck bomb was deadliest attack in Kabul in 18 years of war. No one has claimed responsibility for at least 150 people who were killed, including Nasir Ahmad.
Nasima's memories of that day are harrowing, yet common among Afghans.
""At the hospitals I saw bodies covered with blood, charred. The wounded were screaming. There were boxes full of human body parts,"" Nasima recalled.
Nasima has washed dishes and clothes for the last three years to support her children – two daughters, Naiema, 15, Sabzina, 13, and two sons, Waris, 10, and Arif, 7.
""I have lived my life and have had to suffer; but for my children I want peace,"" she added.
PAIN FOR PEACE
Families of Taliban fighters and security personnel have also faced loss.
Haji Malik, 47, a shopkeeper in the northern city of Kunduz, lost his son, 18-year-old Sarajuddin, a Taliban fighter killed in a clash with international and Afghan forces in Paktika province in 2016.
Sarajuddin ran away from home two years earlier to join the insurgents, and Malik remembered the intense pain he felt when he received word of his son's death.
He never got to bury his him, he said, because the body was in such bad shape that he had to be interred before his father got there.
""This (the Doha agreement) is a chance for peace in Afghanistan, which has suffered through years of war,"" Malik told Reuters. ""But if peace is coming, it should be real peace ... not only for a few days.""
Habibullah Nazari, an officer in Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security (NDS), which has been on the frontline of the fight against the Taliban, was killed in an attack by the militant group.
Nazari was preparing for a security mission along with six colleagues when a Taliban suicide bomber drove his explosive-laden vehicle into the NDS office in the western city of Herat.
He was the sole breadwinner for his family of 12, said his brother, Mohammad Gul, 23.
""Losing a family member is very painful, but I will have no complaint if peace, real peace, is restored,"" said Gul. ""I will believe my brother was martyred in the name of peace."""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has expressed concern after Chinese-ruled Hong Kong arrested publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, an outspoken critic of Beijing, and two pro-democracy activists.
The arrests come after a period of relative calm following months of anti-government protests over perceptions that China is tightening its grip on the city, though Beijing denies meddling and blames the West for fomenting unrest.
Lai and veteran democracy activists Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum, were arrested on Friday in the Asian financial hub on charges of illegal assembly, drawing condemnation from international rights groups, media said.
""We are concerned by the arrest of prominent Hong Kong businessman and publisher Jimmy Lai and two other longtime advocates for civil liberties and democracy,"" Morgan Ortagus, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said on Friday.
""We expect Hong Kong authorities not to use law enforcement selectively for political purposes, and to handle cases fairly and transparently,"" she added in a statement.
The spokeswoman also called for the rule of law and Hong Kong people’s rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression to be preserved.
The police said three local men, aged 63 to 72, were arrested for suspected participation in a non-approved gathering but did not confirm their names.
Authorities in the former British colony have arrested more than 7,000 people for involvement in Hong Kong's protests, many on charges of rioting that can carry jail terms of up to 10 years. It is unclear how many are still in custody.
The arrest of the three men was outrageous, said Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, adding that there was no doubt its government was acting at Beijing's instructions.
""This decision will send yet another signal to the world that the Chinese Communist Party is intent on throttling decency and freedom in Hong Kong,"" Patten said.
Lai, a self-made millionaire who has made financial contributions to Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and been a target of criticism by mainland Chinese media, was arrested in 2014 for refusing to leave a key pro-democracy protest site.
After the arrest he resigned as editor in chief of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily. He has also come under scrutiny from Hong Kong's anti-graft agency, which raided his home in 2014.
In an editorial on Friday, China's state-owned Global Times tabloid called Lai ""a force of evil"", rather than the ""hero"" of democracy painted by the West.
""..he is a traitor, a criminal and a force of evil who has sowed violence and chaos in arguably one of the freest and most prosperous cities in the world,"" it added."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea urged citizens on Saturday to stay indoors as it warned of a ""critical moment"" in its battle on the coronavirus after recording the biggest daily jump in infections, with 594 new cases taking the tally to 2,931.
South Korea is grappling with the largest outbreak of the virus outside China, as a new death took the toll to 17, amid a record daily increase in infections since the country confirmed its first patient on Jan. 20. 
""We have asked you to refrain from taking part in public events, including a religious gathering or protest, this weekend,"" Vice health minister Kim Kang-lip told a briefing.
It was a ""critical moment"" in reining in the spread of the virus, he said, adding, ""Please stay at home and refrain from going outside and minimize contact with other people."" 
As many as 476 of the new cases were from southeastern Daegu city, the site of a church at the center of the outbreak, and 60 from the nearby province of North Gyeongsang, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. 
Health authorities have run tests on more than 210,000 members and 65,000 trainees of the church linked to a majority of cases after a 61-year-old woman known as ""Patient 31"" attended religious services there before testing positive. 
More than 88% have been checked, and about 3,300 have shown symptoms such as fever, Kim added. 
Some provincial officials want to press criminal charges against the church, saying it refused to release a complete list of members, although the church denied the accusation, and urged an end to ""slander and oppression"" of its followers. 
Kim said the government was working with the municipal authorities to check if the church provided an incomplete list. 
A court rejected a plan by conservative groups critical of President Moon Jae-in for a massive weekend rally in downtown Seoul, citing health concerns. 
The rapid spread of the coronavirus has fueled fears of a pandemic, with six countries reporting their first cases this week as the World Health Organization raised its global risk alert to ""very high"". 

In China, it has killed more than 2,800 people and infected about 79,000 after it emerged late last year in the central city of Wuhan.

The move comes after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday asked local authorities to shut schools from Monday in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
This means students will be out from Monday at least until the new academic year starts in early April, prompting Japanese parents, along with teachers and businesses, to scramble to find new ways to live and work.
Abe is expected to explain how the government will cope with impact of the closure of schools at a media briefing scheduled for Saturday, the report said.
Japan also aims to pass legislation that would allow local governments to control the usage of public facilities as another measure to prevent the spread of the virus during the ongoing parliament session, the report said.
Infections from the virus in Japan have topped 200, with five deaths - including one on Friday of a man in his seventies. That excludes more than 700 cases and five more deaths from the quarantined cruise liner Diamond Princess, docked in Yokohama."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has recommended that ministers and diplomats skip traveling to a meeting in New York of the Commission on the Status of Women due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Friday. 
More than 7,000 people usually attend the annual meeting, officials said, which is dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. It is due to be held from March 9 to 20.
However, in a letter to U.N. member states from the chair of the commission, Armenia’s U.N. Ambassador Mher Margaryan said Guterres had recommended that member states ""shorten and scale down the session"" and cancel dozens of side events.
""He also strongly recommended that capital-based representatives refrain from traveling to headquarters for the session,"" Margaryan wrote. 
The bureau of the Commission on the Status of Women proposed that member states agree to Guterres’ recommendations at a meeting on Monday. 
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Guterres made the recommendations given the ""fast-evolving situation"" with the coronavirus and the need to ""balance the UN’s critical work and public health concerns”.
""The advice given by the secretary-general is based on inputs from the Senior Emergency Policy Team and very close consultations between the U.N. Medical Services and the World Health Organization,” Dujarric said. 
The flu-like virus that emerged from central China late last year has spread to about 60 countries, infected more than 85,000 people and killed almost 3,000, mostly in China.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has decided to postpone a meeting with leaders of Southeast Asian countries it had planned to host on March 14 due to worries about the coronavirus outbreak, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter said on Friday.
President Donald Trump had invited leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to meet in Las Vegas after he did not attend a summit with the group in Bangkok in November.
""As the international community works together to defeat the novel coronavirus, the United States, in consultation with ASEAN partners, has made the difficult decision to postpone the ASEAN leaders meeting,"" one of the sources, a senior administration official, told Reuters.
The official added that the United States values its relationships with ASEAN member nations and looks forward to future meetings.
A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department provided an identical statement.
The U.S.-ASEAN Business Council said it was aware of the decision and said a major technology summit it was planning on the sidelines of the leaders' meeting was also being postponed.
""We look forward to working closely with U.S. and ASEAN leadership to ensure the success of this important engagement at a later date,” the council's vice president, Elizabeth Dugan, said in statement.
The postponements come amid growing fears that the virus will spread in the United States as countries report new infections, companies announce curbs on employees' travel and global stock markets continue to plummet.
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States is still relatively small at around 60, most of them repatriated American passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Japan.
The coronavirus outbreak started in China late last year. The latest World Health Organization figures indicate over 82,000 people have been infected, with more than 2,700 deaths in China and 57 deaths in 46 other countries.
While the outbreak appears to be easing in China, it has surged elsewhere and countries other than China now account for about three-quarters of new infections.
China is not a member of ASEAN, which groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
Although the State Department has repeatedly stated that ASEAN is at the heart of its strategy to maintain a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"" in the face of rising Chinese power, Trump’s decision not to attend the Bangkok meeting had raised questions about the U.S. commitment to the region.

Japan's Nikkei Asian Review earlier this month quoted diplomatic sources as saying that leaders from Vietnam, Laos, Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand had planned to attend the Las Vegas summit.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw military drills on Friday, state media KCNA said, a rare public outing amid efforts to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus in the isolated country. 
North Korea has not confirmed any cases of the virus, but state media said a month-long quarantine period had been imposed for people showing symptoms and ""high-intensity"" measures were taken including reinforcing checks in border regions and at airports and sea ports.
On Feb. 16, Kim made his first public appearance in 22 days to visit a mausoleum marking the anniversary of the birth of his father and late leader Kim Jong Il.
The military drill was to ""judge the mobility and the fire power strike ability"" on the frontline and eastern units and ended to the ""great satisfaction"" of Kim, KCNA said on Saturday. 
""Soldiers, who have firmly armed themselves with a-match-for-a-hundred idea of the Party and trained under the simulated conditions of actual battles, reduced a target islet to a sea of flames,"" KCNA said. 
In a separate dispatch, KCNA said Kim has also convened a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party's powerful politburo where a stricter enforcement of ""top-class anti-epidemic steps"" was discussed to prevent the spread of the virus. 
""In case the infectious disease spreading beyond control finds its way into our country, it will entail serious consequences,"" Kim was quoted as telling the meeting. ""No special cases must be allowed within the state anti-epidemic system.""
He instructed the officials to ""seal off all the channels and space through which the infectious disease may find its way, and strengthen check-up, test and quarantine,"" KCNA added. 
A plan is under way to evacuate some 60 quarantined foreign diplomats from North Korea, including from Germany, French and Switzerland, CNN reported on Friday, citing an unnamed source inside the country. The report also said other countries with diplomatic missions were seeking to scale down their operations. 
KCNA released photographs of Kim presiding over the meeting as well as overseeing the drills without wearing a surgical mask. All of the aides who accompanied Kim on the military inspection had identical black masks, whereas none of the participants at the meeting did. 

""Kim's activities appear to be intended to highlight to his people that his campaign to build a self-reliant economy is business as usual while boosting military morale and also showing they were not affected by the virus,"" said Kim Dong-yup, a professor at Kyungnam University in Seoul.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - El Salvador President Nayib Bukele on Friday vetoed a controversial law intended to allow the prosecution of crimes committed during the country's bloody civil war, arguing it was not in the interest of victims.
Congress had narrowly approved the law on Wednesday but opponents criticize that it would allow judges to substantially reduce the sentences of perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
""We issue a veto,"" the president said in a statement, in which he called the law a fraud. ""It is simply an amnesty law."" Human rights organizations and families of victims had asked him to veto it.
El Salvador's civil war, which pitted the former Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation (FMLN) against the country's army, lasted from 1980 to 1992. It left 75,000 dead and 8,000 missing.

The central province of Hubei reported 423 new confirmed cases on Friday, the National Health Commission said on Saturday, up from 318 a day earlier.
That pushed the overall number of new infections on Friday in mainland China to 427, data from the health authority showed.
Of the new cases in Hubei, 420 were reported in the provincial capital of Wuhan, the city hardest-hit by the outbreak.
China has imposed tough measures to contain the pathogen including strict home quarantines, curbs on people and vehicle traffic, and the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday that shuttered businesses and factories.
In the first official snapshot of the economic impact of such restrictions, the national statistics bureau reported on Saturday a record pace of contraction in manufacturing activity in February.
China's economy will take a big hit in the first quarter due to work stoppages, but should recover rapidly unless the outbreak worsens again, a Chinese official told Reuters on Friday.
The International Monetary Fund has said the outbreak will likely lower China's economic growth by 0.4 percentage point this year to 5.6% and shave 0.1 percentage point from global growth.
The new infections on Friday bring the total accumulated number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 79,251.
The death toll from the outbreak in China reached 2,835 as of the end of Friday, up by 47 from the previous day. Hubei province reported 45 new deaths, while in provincial capital Wuhan 37 people died.
As new daily infections in China slow, the government has urged businesses and factories in regions that are considered low-risk to resume production and safeguard jobs.
Seventeen provinces, regions and municipalities have lowered their emergency response level so far, including big coastal provinces such as Guangdong and Jiangsu.
Beijing and Shanghai have yet to downgrade their emergency measures from the highest level.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co has started calling back many of the 450 workers it laid off earlier this month in eastern Canada, when blockades crippled operations on strategic rail lines, according to a company email sent to customers on Friday.
Earlier this week, police made 10 arrests and cleared a blockade in eastern Canada that had been stopping freight and passenger traffic for almost three weeks on one of Canada's busiest lines.
The blockades were held in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en people in the Pacific province of British Columbia, who are seeking to stop TC Energy Corp from building a gas pipeline over their land.
""In the absence of illegal blockades on our network over the last 24 hours, and while we are keeping a close watch for any further disruptions, we have started calling back many of the temporarily laid off employees based in Eastern Canada,"" CN chief executive Jean-Jacques Ruest said in the email seen by Reuters.
The email did not specify how many of the 450 workers were being called back.
After 21 days of disruptions, ""there is a significant backlog of trains parked on our tracks and in our yards that will be processed,"" the email said.
""The complete network recovery process will take several weeks.""
Montreal-based CN said the company was on its way to recovering in Western Canada, and said products like export grain, imported containerized goods, coal, potash and other commodities are moving to market.
Canada relies on CN and rival Canadian Pacific Railway to move crops, oil, potash, coal and manufactured goods to ports and the United States. About half of Canada’s exports move by rail, according to industry data."

BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Voters look poised to oust the center-left Smer party that has dominated Slovakia's political landscape for more than a decade in a national election on Saturday overshadowed by anger over high-level graft.
Opinion polls ahead of a two-week moratorium before the ballot pointed to a rapid rise for anti-corruption movement Ordinary People (OLANO), increasing chances it may form a center-right majority with smaller conservative and liberal parties to outmaneuver Smer. 
OLANO founder and leader Igor Matovic has pledged to clean up Slovak politics, an ambition encapsulated in his party's slogan: ""Let's Beat the Mafia Together"". 
""We can get rid of government that used its power to make itself and connected people rich,"" he said in the final television debate this week. ""Poor people were paying for that, sick people were dying unnecessarily, and young people were leaving Slovakia. Let's turn that around."" 
The political shift in the euro zone member state, which has avoided fights with Brussels unlike its central European Visegrad Groups neighbors Hungary and Poland, started with the 2018 murder of journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancee.
An investigation unearthed communications between a businessman now on trial for ordering the hit and politicians and judicial officials. He has denied the charges.
The killing led to the biggest street protests in the post-communist era, forcing Smer leader Robert Fico to resign, though his party's coalition held on to power in the nation of 5.5 million.
OLANO's support surged after Matovic filmed a video outside a former Smer finance minister's villa in France last month and called for the property to be confiscated.
Matovic, 46, told Reuters last week he wanted to be a conciliatory voice toward the EU within Visegrad.
The former owner of regional newspapers, a lawmaker since 2010, calls himself a social conservative and economic liberal. 
In the European Parliament, OLANO is aligned with the center-right European People's Party. 
""What could happen would be some differentiation from other Visegrad countries and leaning toward Germany or the German-French (European) engine,"" said political scientist Pavol Babos from Comenius University in Bratislava. 
An OLANO-led government might struggle to agree on policies, however, as it would be made up of up to six parties including euroskeptics, conservatives and progressives.
Smer was seen scoring its worst result since 2002, although it might still end up as the biggest party. Its nationalist and Hungarian minority allies faced the threat of dropping out of parliament. 
It might try to retain power by securing support from the far-right People's Party, but political analysts said that option looked increasingly unlikely.

No new government is likely to lift Slovakia's opposition to accepting migrants or allowing gay partnerships or marriages.

225,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 06:04PM ET</span>","Trump willing to meet leaders of Russia, China, Britain, France on arms control","By Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is willing to hold a summit with the leaders of Russia, China, Britain and France - the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council - to discuss arms control, a senior administration official said on Friday.
Trump wants to use the meeting to try to make progress on a three-way arms control deal with Russia and China, the official said. The timing for a summit was unclear.
""The United States will use this opportunity to bring both Russia and China into the international arms control framework and head off a costly arms race,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has raised the idea of a summit of what is known as the P5 to discuss a variety of global issues. Neither Russia nor China are members of the Group of Seven nations that will hold their annual summit in Camp David, Maryland, this year.
The official would not speculate on where a P5 summit would be held, but one logical option could be the U.N. General Assembly, where world leaders gather annually in September.
""The president has made clear that he is ready to meet with any world leader at any time to advance U.S. national security interests. The United States will work with the other P5 countries to develop and organize such a meeting,"" the official said.
Trump has sought to persuade China to join the United States and Russia in talks on an arms control accord to replace the 2010 New START treaty between Washington and Moscow that expires next February.
The nuclear arsenals of the United States and Russia dwarf that of China. But Beijing’s military buildup in the Asia-Pacific region has alarmed U.S. allies and policymakers.
China has rejected Trump’s proposal, arguing that its smaller nuclear force is defensive and poses no threat.
“Both Russia and China have an interest in avoiding a United States that is unconstrained in its ability to modernize and field nuclear forces,"" the official said.
The official added, ""As the major military powers of the day, and members of the P5, Russia, China, and the United States have an obligation to reduce risk and engage in arms control. Not doing so would be irresponsible.”
New START maintains the only remaining limits on U.S. and Russian nuclear deployments. Some experts and lawmakers have called Trump’s proposal to include Beijing in a new treaty a “poison pill” strategy aimed at killing New START and ending the restraints on U.S. deployments.
New START restricted the United States and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 nuclear warheads, the lowest level in decades, and limited the land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers that deliver them.
It can be renewed for up to five years if both sides agree. Moscow has offered to immediately extend the treaty. Washington has yet to decide.

China is estimated to have about 300 nuclear weapons.

The 9.5 tonnes of cocaine were seized in February 2019 after the ship, which was travelling to Morocco from South America, docked at the port of Praia for legal reasons following the death of a crew member.
An Atlantic archipelago of 500,000 people off Africa’s west coast, Cape Verde has long tried to tackle gangs trafficking Latin American cocaine to Europe via West Africa.
Captain Sergei Kotlovskii said during the trial that he had been forced to take the drugs onboard in the Caribbean by the ship's owner and that the 10 crew members were not aware of the illicit cargo. 
Kotlovskii got 12 years for international drug trafficking. The rest of the crew got 10 years for the same crime. They were acquitted of the second charge of criminal association.
""All the defendants were aware of the narcotic drug placed on the vessel and acted with intent, freely and consciously in exchange for economic benefit,"" according to the court judgment read by Judge Angela Rodrigues. 
Defence lawyer Martinho Landim lawyer said he would appeal the decision. 
Use is rising of hard drugs like cocaine, heroin and amphetamines in West Africa, where countries that once served primarily as transit points for trade between South America and Europe are now active consumer markets.

228,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 04:19PM ET</span>",U.S. court deals serious blow to Trump's 'Remain in Mexico' immigration policy,"By Mica Rosenberg
(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday blocked one of President Donald Trump's signature immigration policies that has helped to sharply curb a migration surge on the southern border and forced tens of thousands of migrants to wait in Mexico. 
The decision is a major blow to Trump who has declared the policy a success in reducing the flow of hundreds of thousands of people from Central America into the United States as he campaigns for a second term in office. 
A three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their argument that the program, called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), violated U.S. immigration law and international obligations on the treatment of asylum seekers. 
Some 59,000 people have been sent back to Mexico to await the outcome of their cases in often dangerous border towns where they are vulnerable to kidnapping, rape, robbery and other crimes while living in sometimes unsanitary conditions. 
Immigration attorneys rushed to ports of entry on the border after the ruling to ensure Customs and Border Protection officers were aware that the program had been blocked, said Taylor Levy, an El Paso-based immigration attorney.
The ruling means the United States can no longer send people back to Mexico under the program, said Michael Tan, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. It is not clear how it affects people already in the program in Mexico. 
The U.S. Department of Justice and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment but the administration is likely to quickly appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, as it has done with other rulings. 
Trump, who has made cracking down on immigration a central theme of his more than three years in the White House, has sought through a series of new policies and rule changes to reduce asylum claims filed mostly by Central Americans arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. 
The Trump administration's policies on curbing asylum applications have led to a significant decline in the number of illegal crossings reported by border agents, and have been more successful than the president's efforts to construct a physical barrier on the southern border.
Arrests of family units on the U.S.-Mexico border from October to January fell to 32,480, a nearly 70 percent drop compared to the same period a year earlier. 
AS DANGEROUS AS YEMEN
Migrants in the MPP program, many of them children, have faced violence and homelessness as they wait for their court dates. At least 1,000 people sent back under the program were violently attacked or threatened in Mexico, according to a Feb. 28 Human Rights First report that documented kidnappings, rapes and assaults. 
One of the states to which thousands of migrants were returned, Tamaulipas, is described by the U.S. State Department as carrying the same risk level as Yemen and Syria due to crimes including ""murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, forced disappearances, extortion, and sexual assault.""
The Trump administration had argued the program did not violate a principle in international law known as non-refoulement, which says asylum seekers should not be returned to places where they face danger. The administration has said migrants could tell officials at any point in the process they had a fear of returning to Mexico. 
Very few migrants have been transferred out of the program to pursue the resolution of their court cases in the United States, according to a Reuters analysis of immigration court data published last year. [nL2N23I0UI] 
A Washington-area union for federal asylum officers argued against the MPP program in a brief filed in the case. 
""By forcing a vulnerable population to return to a hostile territory where they are likely to face persecution, the MPP abandons our tradition of providing a safe haven to the persecuted,"" the union wrote.
The appeals court panel concluded that plaintiffs in the case, which included 11 asylum seekers and several immigration advocacy groups, ""had shown a likelihood of success on their claim that the MPP does not comply with the United States' treaty-based non-refoulement obligations."" 
The Trump administration has said most asylum petitions are ultimately denied by immigration courts and releasing migrants into the United States to wait for hearings encourages people to disappear into the country. Officials say making migrants wait in Mexico is a way to cut down on fraudulent asylum claims.
In a separate ruling on Friday, the 9th Circuit left in place a lower court's block on a Trump administration regulation that barred migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border between ports of entry from seeking asylum.

A three-judge panel in that case found the regulation - issued in November 2018 and swiftly enjoined by a federal judge in the Northern District of California - conflicted with federal immigration statutes on asylum and amounted to ""a categorical ban"" on certain asylum seekers.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 04:06PM ET</span>",Pompeo to attend signing of U.S.-Taliban troop withdrawal pact,"By Humeyra Pamuk and Arshad Mohammed
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will witness the signing of a U.S.-Taliban agreement on a withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, President Donald Trump said on Friday, heralding an agreement that could help his re-election campaign.
The deal, part of a wider push for Afghan reconciliation and an end to the longest U.S. war, faces many obstacles, including an election feud between Afghanistan's two leading politicians. It is expected to be signed in Qatar's capital Doha on Saturday. 
The U.S.-Taliban agreement would begin a phased withdrawal of American and coalition forces. It would require the Taliban to initiate a formal dialogue with the Afghan government and other political and civil society groups on a permanent nationwide ceasefire and power sharing in postwar Afghanistan. 
U.S. forces invaded the Southwest Asian country in 2001 to topple the Taliban rulers who provided a safe haven in which al Qaeda planned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and the Pentagon that killed nearly 3,000 people.
Among the many obstacles to peace are resolving a dispute between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his main political rival, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah. Both have claimed victory in the disputed Sept. 28 presidential election.
There is also the undecided question of who will form the Afghan team that would negotiate with the Taliban on how to bring the insurgents into the political process and, ultimately, how to share power with the movement.
The agreement calls for a long-planned initial drawdown to 8,600 U.S. troops from some 13,000 but it ties further cuts to the Taliban keeping promises it may find challenging, such as cutting deep ties with al Qaeda and other militant groups.
""If the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan live up to these commitments, we will have a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home,"" Trump said in a statement, saying Pompeo would ""soon"" witness the signing.
""We ... urge the Afghan people to seize this opportunity for peace and a new future for their country,"" he added, without addressing when or where the signing would happen.
Earlier, Pompeo told U.S. lawmakers he had seen a ""significant"" reduction of violence in Afghanistan over the past six days.
If extended for a full week, the ""Reduction in Violence"" pact that took effect on Feb. 22 is expected to culminate in the signing of an agreement between top U.S. and Taliban negotiators on Saturday in Doha, the Taliban's political headquarters.
Afghan officials met Taliban members in Qatar on Friday to discuss a prisoner swap plan.
Testifying before the House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, Pompeo said Washington is watching to see whether neighboring Iran may seek to play a spoiler role in Afghanistan.
""We have seen just these last six days a significant reduction in violence in Afghanistan,"" Pompeo said. He said there was a history of Iran ""to act as a spoiler"" inside Afghanistan.
Trump has made withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan a major foreign policy objective. An agreement with the Taliban to end the 18-year-old war could boost his re-election prospects.
The American troops are part of a U.S-led NATO mission that trains and aids Afghan forces and carries out counterterrorism operations to prop up the Kabul government and prevent an al Qaeda resurgence.

""When I ran for office, I promised the American people I would begin to bring our troops home, and seek to end this war,"" Trump said in his statement. ""We are making substantial progress on that promise.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - As deadly violence erupted in the northeast of New Delhi this week, with armed mobs rampaging the streets, a small hospital located in a densely packed Muslim neighborhood found itself at the epicenter of the unrest.
Al-Hind Hospital, in the riot-torn Mustafabad neighborhood, was flooded with patients this week, and it has also become a place of refuge for people whose homes were burned or destroyed.
At least 38 people were killed and hundreds more injured in the worst sectarian violence in Delhi in decades, as groups of Hindus and Muslims clashed.
The violence began after weeks of protests over a citizenship law that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government introduced in December, which eases the path to Indian citizenship for minority groups from neighboring Muslim-majority countries.
Critics say the law is biased against Muslims and undermines India's secular constitution. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party has denied having any bias against India's 180 million Muslims.
On Thursday people were still trickling in, saying they had suffered acid attacks and beatings with rods.
Doctors described being overwhelmed on Monday and Tuesday when dozens of wounded streamed into the 15-bed, two-storey building. Some were carried on people's shoulders and others on wooden carts, stretching the hospital's resources to the limit.
Many medicines ran out, as did oxygen supplies. But the flow of patients didn't stop, said doctor Mehraj Ekram.
""We were all crying as we treated them. For the rest of my life, I will not be able to shake those days from my mind,"" he said. ""The brutality with which people had been beaten, it'll never leave me.""
""At one point, we had to pull the shutters down, because we could not take in more people,"" he said, tears welling up in his eyes.
AMBULANCES BLOCKED
M.A. Anwar, a local doctor who set up the hospital two years ago to make up for the lack of good primary care in the area, said the facility was only built to give patients basic initial treatment.
But, as thousands gathered around the hospital on Tuesday, ambulances could not enter to take patients to bigger hospitals, said Anwar.
Amid the cries of worried families, Anwar contacted lawyers who secured a midnight hearing from a High Court bench in Delhi that eventually ordered the police to escort ambulances to the entrance.
Al-Hind had no mortuary. As they got into an ambulance to take the dead bodies away, Anwar said the vehicle was chased by men wielding swords.
""I hope in my life I never have to witness such inhumanity again,"" he said.
On Thursday, traumatized families sat at the hospital. Some had lost their homes and livelihoods.
Irshaad, a tailor who uses only one name, sat with his four young children and wife with a small pile of clothes - his house had been burned down.
""Everything is gone,"" he said, breaking down. ""What will my kids' future be? I have no documents, nothing to show anymore.""
On the floor below lay 26-year-old Muslim Shabana Parveen, who had given birth after being beaten while heavily pregnant at her home on Tuesday.
She went into labor that day, and a Hindu neighbor took her to safety, she said.
""A mob came into my home and hit me with rods on my stomach. I didn't think my baby would survive,"" she said, as her rosy-cheeked infant yawned beside her. ""I don't know where I'll go. We've lost everything."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Friday dismissed a lawsuit claiming that Woody Guthrie's iconic 1940 folk song ""This Land is Your Land"" belongs to the public.
U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel ruled against members of the New York band Satorii, which recorded two versions of ""This Land,"" after the two publishers that control the song's rights agreed not to sue them for copyright infringement.
Satorii had claimed that the ""This Land"" melody closely resembled a Baptist gospel hymn from around the start of the 20th century, known by such titles as ""Fire Song,"" and that any copyright to ""This Land"" lapsed several decades ago.
It sued the publishers Ludlow Music and The Richmond Organization in June 2016, seeking to void their copyright and establish that ""This Land"" was in the public domain.
In March 2019, U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts had allowed Satorii to pursue its copyright claims.
But the following month, the publishers entered a ""covenant not to sue"" Satorii over ""This Land,"" and refunded a $45.50 licensing fee the band had paid to produce its versions.
Castel, who took over the case following Batts' Feb. 3 death, said the ""extremely broad"" covenant mooted Satorii's case, and there was no reasonable expectation the publishers might again challenge its use of ""This Land.""
""We are disappointed with the court's decision, which gave the defendants unfair veto power to stop this meritorious case from proceeding,"" Satorii's lawyer, Mark Rifkin, said in an email. ""We are considering how best to continue to pursue these important issues.""
Paul LiCalsi, a lawyer for the publishers, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Rifkin and his law firm have - through litigation -successfully moved other classic American songs into the public domain, including ""Happy Birthday to You"" and the civil rights anthem ""We Shall Overcome.""
Guthrie wrote ""This Land"" at age 27 in reaction to Irving Berlin's ""God Bless America,"" which he thought glossed over the country's wealth and land inequality, according to the Library of Congress.

Bibi was acquitted of the blasphemy conviction last year and has since been living with her family in Canada. Her case outraged Christians worldwide and fanned divisions inside mainly Muslim Pakistan.
Asked by reporters after her audience with Macron if there had been a French offer of asylum, Bibi said: ""I have received the invitation from the president and the French Republic, and I'm honored.""
Speaking outside Macron's Elysee Palace headquarters, she said, though, that she needed time to make a decision about whether to move to France, saying she wanted to focus for now on her health and her family.
An Elysee official said: ""France is ready to welcome her if that is her wish, in accordance with the procedures for a request for asylum.""
Under French rules, someone seeking asylum has to submit a request to an independent state agency, which decides whether to grant it. It was not clear if Bibi had submitted a request.
Bibi, a farm worker and a mother of four, was convicted in 2010 of making derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbors working in the fields with her objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim.
She spent eight years on death row.
She was released in October 2018 after Pakistan's Supreme Court overturned her conviction. That decision prompted protests from religious hardliners calling for her death and demanding that the government prevent her from leaving Pakistan.
Two politicians in Pakistan who sought to help her were assassinated, including Punjab province governor Salman Taseer, shot by his own bodyguard. She left Pakistan for Canada in May 2019."
234,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 01:49PM ET</span>","As coronavirus slams Italy, paralysis and anxiety spread","By Emilio Parodi and Angelo Amante
MILAN (Reuters) - At the epicenter of Europe's worst outbreak of coronavirus to date, daily lives have taken on an eerie, aimless calm. It's at night that the worry takes over.
""You can hear the ambulances coming and going, and maybe they're going to sick people who have nothing to do with the coronavirus but it worries you just the same,"" said Davide Benelli from his home in Casalpusterlengo, a town of around 15,000 in Italy's quarantined ""red zone"" where the disease broke out a week ago.
People in the zone wake up to closed cafes, restaurants and schools; farmers worry that planting should be starting around now. Parents try to keep their children amused with games or jobs around the house, or go on bike rides or drives to break the boredom.
As the economic shocks triggered by this paralysis in the country's northern industrial heartland reverberate across Europe, Italians are still trying to get to grips with how a seemingly isolated case could balloon within days, to bring the eurozone's third-largest economy to the brink of recession.
Almost 900 coronavirus cases have been confirmed. Authorities have put part of Italy's most productive region into lockdown, shut the Venice carnival, one of its main tourist events, and postponed Milan's showpiece design fair.
Lombardy, the region around Italy's financial capital, Milan, sits on the border with Switzerland and is one of the richest and most productive in Europe. Along with neighboring Veneto, the other main area hit by the coronavirus outbreak, it generates around a third of Italy's economic output.
Economists expect the crisis to tip Italy's already struggling economy into recession by the end of the first quarter, with knock-on effects likely to last for months.
""In Veneto, we have 600,000 businesses and we make 150 billion euros ($165 billion) of GDP per year, if we go into recession, Italy will fail,"" said Luca Zaia, governor of the region of Veneto.
The lockdown, which started on Feb. 23, affects 10 towns in Lombardy and one in Veneto and isolates some 50,000 people from the outside world. Trucks can get in and out with bare essentials, but police roadblocks keep everyone else in.
Italy's case reveals how vulnerable a Western economy can be to unexpected outside events. The red zone and the region around it is a microcosm of the Italian economy. The area contains everything from warehouses and logistics centers for companies to cheese and dairy processing centers.
Local engineering unions say some 6,000 manufacturing workers, mainly those living in the red zone, have been sent home or put on short hours.
""We are very worried. We'll have to wait a couple of months for a reliable estimate of the effects on employment ... but the initial signals are alarming,"" said Andrea Donega, secretary general of the regional branch of the FIM-CISL union.
Banks are taking steps to ensure people can access cash. Banco BPM SpA, one of the region's main banks, has temporarily stopped charging customers from other banks who use its ATMs.
The impact is hurting areas of Italy barely touched by the virus. Italy's tourism federation, Assoturismo, said up to 90% of hotel and travel agency bookings had been canceled in Rome and up to 80% in Sicily for March, as school trips and conferences across the country were called off, and foreigners opted for caution.
""Italian tourism never experienced a crisis on this scale in recent history. This is the darkest moment. Not even 9/11 hit our business so hard,"" said Assoturismo chief, Vittorio Messina.
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?
Italians want to know why their country has become the Wuhan of Europe. The first two cases in Italy came to light at the end of January when two Chinese tourists from the city that is ground zero of the deadly disease fell ill during a trip to the country.
The couple were immediately put into isolation, everyone they had come into contact with was tested for the virus, and Italy's government became the first in Europe to ban all direct flights to and from China, in a bid to halt further contagion. The two Chinese are not believed to have infected anyone else.
""The system of prevention put into place by Italy is the most rigorous in Europe,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters reassuringly on Jan 31.
His confidence was misplaced.
On Feb. 21, Lombardy announced that a 38-year-old Italian man, named only as Mattia, from the town of Codogno, 60 km (40 miles) southeast of Milan, had tested positive for the virus. Within a week, 888 people were confirmed to have caught the disease, of whom 21 had died.
""We were considered to be the country that had adopted the most drastic and fastest preventative measures,"" said Massimo Galli, head of the infectious diseases department at Milan's Sacco hospital, where some coronavirus patients are being treated. But he said the epidemic probably started well before Codogno resident Mattia, dubbed ""patient one,"" fell ill.
The illness is spread through the air and can leave some people symptom-free while local authorities say about two in 100 develop fatal complications including pneumonia, making it a stealth killer able to infect thousands without their knowing it.
When Mattia first showed up in the Codogno hospital on Feb. 18, no alarm was raised about his symptoms because he had not been to China, local officials said.
The consequences were dramatic.
After spending time in the emergency room that day, surrounded by other sick patients, he decided to return home, the local health authority said. But his condition worsened and he was back in hospital the next day with no protection in place.
He was not diagnosed until the night of Feb. 20 and by then he had infected five health workers and at least one fellow patient, besides his pregnant wife and a friend. They in turn spread the disease before going into quarantine.
A nurse from the hospital told Reuters on Thursday that he suspected the illness had been circulating days before Mattia arrived seeking help.
""For at least a week before the first case was discovered, we had observed an abnormal number of pneumonia cases. All these persons were treated and sent back home,"" he said, asking not to be named.
He said confusion reigned in the hours after news broke that Mattia had tested positive.
""At the beginning (management) kept us in the hospital for 30 hours. Then they told us to go home and place ourselves in quarantine. Eventually, they told us to come back to the hospital,"" he added. ""As a result, more health workers than patients were infected in Codogno hospital.""
The local health agency responsible for the hospital did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prime Minister Conte has accused the hospital of mismanaging the case and contributing to spreading the virus, saying it did not follow the right protocols.
The hospital has said it did, as has Lombardy's regional government, which oversees the local health service. It argues that Rome changed its guidelines at the end of January on testing possible coronavirus patients. The new rules said swabs only had to be taken from people with connections to China — something that did not apply to Mattia.
Prompted by Conte's complaint, prosecutors have opened an investigation into the procedures followed by the hospital. It may take many weeks before they reach any conclusions.
No one knows who brought the illness to Italy's wealthy north: Scientists initially believed the unwitting ""patient zero"" might have been a colleague of the Codogno patient who had recently returned from a business trip in China. But he tested negative, leaving no other obvious candidates.
Dr. Marino Faccini leads a team of experts in Milan who are tasked with trying to find the source of viral outbreaks. However, after days of plotting possible paths for the infection, he has drawn a blank.
""We are (now) working to limit the virus and not so much looking for patient zero, whose (illness) dates back quite some time and is difficult to locate,"" Faccini told Reuters.
SHOCK WAVES
The authorities have had to strike a difficult balance between ensuring public safety and trying to prevent panic.
""Only 0.1% of the country is involved,"" Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio told reporters on Thursday. But local authorities say they have had to impose broad restrictions to prevent the spread of contagion, which would overload the health service to the point of collapse.
""If this outbreak spreads, hospitals will face a serious crisis, not only for the coronavirus admissions but for all patients,"" the Lombardy regional government said in a statement on Friday.
In the red zone, only strictly necessary services such as supermarkets are open. School children have been doing homework remotely and communicating with their teachers by WhatsApp.
The economic shockwaves have been felt across the country, in businesses of all sizes. The area is a rich agricultural producer, with around 500 farms and some 100,000 cattle and pigs. With planting due now, ""everyone should be working flat out,"" said Gianpiero Gruppi, who raises pigs and mixed cereal crops in San Rocco al Porto, near Lodi.
Instead, two of his farm workers are in lockdown and he and his brother have been forced to do the work of four on their own. ""I don't know how long we'll be able to go on like this,"" he said.
The only way to get things in and out is to hand them to police on the checkpoints or leave them to be picked up.
Carlo Migli, a dairy farmer near Lodi who has 300 head of dairy cattle, has struggled to get the necessary health checks on milk samples because the nearest testing centers are outside the red zone.
If he can't get the checks done, he'll have to throw out daily production of 3,000 liters of milk, he said.
Local producers worry future sales will suffer as buyers shy away, even though the virus does not affect food safety. Coldiretti, an agricultural lobby group, has already warned that food products from Italy are facing additional sanitary checks in some places.
Carlo Cornali, owner of Pasticceria Cornali, a century-old bakery in Codogno which makes a famous biscuit sold locally and beyond, has had to stop production altogether. Just ahead of the normally busy Easter season, he has canceled his own orders to suppliers.
""We can't do anything because the eggs come from outside the red zone,"" he said.
""I don't know when we're going to open and if we open, what it will be like, because we'll have to see the effects of this general psychosis.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Vatican officials acknowledged on Friday that bishops in about 10 countries still have no guidelines for dealing with sexual abuse cases, as it unveiled a new ""task force"" to help them and others.
The group of experts in preventing sexual abuse will assist bishops conferences in those countries put them into place and help revise guidelines in countries where they exist so they adhere to recent changes in Church law.
At a news conference presenting the task force, the officials said countries still lacking no guidelines are in that situation because of wars, political upheaval or lack of resources resulting from extreme poverty.
The officials, Father Federico Lombardi and Bishop Juan Ignacio Arrieta, declined to name the countries.
""Bishops in countries that are at war sometimes cannot even meet with each other because it is too dangerous,"" Arrieta said, adding that no developed country was still without guidelines.
Former Pope Benedict first mandated the guidelines in 2011 and the creation of the task force was decided a year ago at a Vatican summit of heads of bishops conferences from around the world called by Pope Francis.
The guidelines aim to create procedures for the reporting of abuse, training for local staff in prevention strategies and reaching out to victims and listening to them.
The task force will be overseen by the Vatican's deputy secretary of state, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, and the four main organizers of the 2019 abuse summit.
They are Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta and Jesuit priest Hans Zollner, both experts in child abuse prevention, as well as Cardinals Blase Cupich of Chicago and Oswald Gracias of India.
The Catholic Church around the world is still struggling to come to grips with the worldwide crisis, which devastated its credibility and dented its coffers.
About two dozen dioceses in the United States alone have filed for bankruptcy because of mounting lawsuits.
A number of U.S. states have also changed statutes of limitations law enabling victims to file for damages for abuse that occurred decades ago, moves that will likely hit the Church further financially."

PODGORICA (Reuters) - Montenegro's president accused Serbia and Russia on Friday of using the Serbian Orthodox Church to undermine his country's pro-Western government as it seeks European Union membership.
Milo Djukanovic, who has ruled for over three decades, said that a series of rallies against a religion law which have been led by Serbian Orthodox clerics in the tiny Balkan country were intended ""to question Montenegro's independence.""
Metropolitan Ilarion, a Russian Orthodox Church cleric, has voiced support for the interests of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro. Metropolitan Onufriy, the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church which is loyal to the Moscow patriarchate, joined protests this week in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica.
""If you are asking whether this is a continuity of the (attempted) destruction of Montenegro and obstruction of its intention to continue its path to ... European and Euro-Atlantic integrations, there's no doubt in that,"" Djukanovic told Reuters in an interview.
""Moscow was unequivocal in stating its interests in the ongoing (religion) problem in Montenegro.""
Djukanovic accused Belgrade of reviving the nationalistic concept of a Greater Serbia that contributed to the Balkan wars of the 1990s and former Yugoslavia's collapse.
""We have no doubt that ... all the mechanisms of the implementation of the Greater Serbian state project ... have been put into motion, and that Montenegro is also a target,"" he said.
Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia's Foreign Ministry, dismissed Djukanovic's remarks, saying: ""Nobody could possibly undermine his own doings more than himself.""
Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic rejected Djukanovic's comments. Referring to protests he has faced un the country of 620,000, she said he had ""a problem in his own country and with he citizens of Montenegro.""
""I am surprised by the rhetoric of President Djukanovic ... Serbia has abandoned 1990s long time ago and turned to the future,"" Brnabic said, adding that Serbia was demanding for Serbs in Montenegro only the right to their own language and religion.
EU AMBITIONS
The protests that began in December are over a law which would allow the state to take ownership of church property if the church cannot prove it owned it before 1918 - when the-then Kingdom of Montenegro joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the predecessor of Yugoslavia.
The Serbian Orthodox Church is the dominant religion in Montenegro, a country of 620,000 people, and has around 12 million members, mainly in Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia.
Serbia and Montenegro are both negotiating entry to the EU. Montenegro joined NATO in 2017, but Belgrade is not seeking membership of the defense alliance.
Ethnic Serbs account for around a third of Montenegro's population. Many Serbians have roots in Montenegro and families in the country, while tens of thousands of Montenegrins reside in Serbia.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has said Belgrade will not interfere in Montenegro's affairs, but also said Serbia will help the Serb minority there.
""Serbia is rushing headlong into a dangerous trap of protection of allegedly endangered rights of (minority) Serbs ... while endangering the sovereignty of other states,"" Djukanovic said."

KABUL (Reuters) - Like many young Afghans, 13-year-old music student Sara Habib is nervous about an agreement between the Taliban and the United States due to be signed in Doha on Saturday, which would include pulling U.S. troops out of the country after 18 years.
""I'm a little concerned about my future, because if any group like the Taliban or any other groups come to the country, I would no longer have my educational freedom,"" the teenager said, while strumming her guitar after classes at a Kabul music academy.
The Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 after seizing power following years of civil war, and imposed many restrictions on women and activities it deemed ""un-Islamic"".
Since 2001, it has led a violent insurgency against the internationally backed government, killing thousands.
Previous attempts at negotiating peace have been scuttled by violence, most recently last December, when an attack on a U.S. military base claimed by the Taliban put talks on hold.
The Taliban has recently been projecting itself as more moderate, saying Islam gives women rights in areas such as business and ownership, inheritance, education, work, the choice of a husband, security and well-being.
The Taliban did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
PEACE A LONG TIME COMING
Habib used to study at the International School of Kabul, where her favorite subject was music. After the school closed five years ago due to security issues, she decided to continue her guitar-playing. It made her and everyone around her happy, she says.
Seven months ago, she joined the Asoo music academy, where she and three other students sit in a small circle as they practise playing folk music, harmonizing on their guitars. Habib taps a scuffed black boot to the beat.
A fellow music student at Asoo said peace was a long time coming. ""There are negotiations every day, and other countries decide for us; how long can we tolerate this? And that's why I'm disappointed with the country's security situation,"" said Mahdi Fayazi.
At home, Habib is no different from many other girls her age. She enjoys singing a song from an animated Barbie movie and reading books from ""The Breadwinner"" series of children's novels set in Taliban-era Afghanistan by Canadian author Deborah Ellis.
""I have lots of hopes for the future,"" Habib says, explaining that she doesn't have much first-hand knowledge about the Taliban, as she was born after the group's fall in 2001.
Still, she is clear about how she feels.
""Every group that is against women's progress and also against human rights is not acceptable for me."""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican moved on Friday to dismiss speculation that Pope Francis was anything more than ""slightly unwell"" as the 83-year-old Roman Catholic leader canceled official audiences for the second day. 
The Vatican has not specified what the pope is suffering from.
At his general audience on Wednesday he appeared to have a cold and spoke with a slightly hoarse voice, and he coughed during an afternoon Ash Wednesday service in a Rome church, his last appearance outside the Vatican. 
Spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement on Friday morning the pope had celebrated early morning Mass, as is customary, in the chapel of the Santa Marta guest house where he lives and greeted those who attended.
""But he thought it was best to postpone today's official audiences. The meetings scheduled to take place in Santa Marta will take place regularly,"" Bruni said.
On Friday afternoon, Bruni said: ""There is no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition. Even this afternoon, the Holy Father's meetings continued in Santa Marta.
Bruni added that the pope was still ""slightly unwell"".
On Friday morning, Francis was to have received executives from  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM), and other technology companies.
His speech to them from the Apostolic Palace was to have been streamed to participants of a conference in Rome on ethics in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
At the conference, Microsoft,  IBM , the Vatican and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), signed a memo of understanding on AI. 
The pope usually spends mornings making speeches to groups and meeting heads of state in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace.
But unlike previous popes, he chose not to live in its spacious papal apartments and opted for simple quarters in Santa Marta, where he spends the rest of the day mostly working on Church matters.
On Thursday he canceled a visit to a Rome basilica.
Francis is missing a part of one lung. It was removed when he was in his early 20s in his native Buenos Aires after he suffered from tuberculosis.
He also suffers some leg pain due to sciatica, for which he undergoes regular physical therapy and which explains his occasional difficulty climbing steps.
But he is otherwise in generally good health.
Some Lent Ash Wednesday services were canceled or limited in areas of northern Italy hit by the spread of coronavirus.
More than 400 people have contracted the disease and 12 have died of it in Italy, in the worst contagion from the coronavirus so far recorded in Europe.

A number of people wore masks in St. Peter’s Square (NYSE:SQ) at his Wednesday general audience.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Hundreds of migrants in Turkey started arriving on the borders with Greece and Bulgaria on Friday after a senior Turkish official said Ankara would no longer abide by a 2016 EU deal and stop refugees from reaching Europe.
The migrants, some carrying small children and carrier bags, trekked along roads out of Istanbul and through fields, in scenes reminiscent of the 2015 refugee crisis, when more than a million people fleeing wars and poverty sought asylum in Europe.
Some wore face masks, in an apparent attempt to guard against the coronavirus outbreak now sweeping the world and adding to the concerns of hard-pressed European authorities.
Greece and Bulgaria, both European Union member states, vowed not to admit the migrants. Greek police used smoke grenades at one border crossing, while Bulgaria sent an extra 1,000 troops to its border with Turkey.
""There is no work (here in Turkey),"" said Muhammed Abdullah, a 25-year-old Syrian queuing in Istanbul to board a bus bound for the Greek border.
""Turkey is not nice at all, Europe is nicer,"" he said, adding that he wanted to go to Germany.
But at the Pazarkule border post with Greece, scores of migrants faced barbed wire fences and smoke grenades. Some stuck in the no-man's land between the two countries tried to return to the Turkish side to escape the smoke, only to be turned back by the authorities there.
""There are many problems here (in Turkey). We want the Turkish and European governments to open this gate,"" said Hamid Muhammed, who was holding a young girl at the Greek border.
Some young men, with nothing else to do, kicked a football around. Women in headscarves wept in desperation.
BY BUS, TAXI AND DINGHY
Syrians, Iranians, Iraqis, Pakistanis and Moroccans were among the migrants arriving at the border crossings with Greece and Bulgaria, about 200 km (125 miles) west of Istanbul, Turkey's pro-government Demiroren news agency said.
""We heard about (Turkey's decision) on the television,"" said migrant Sahin Nebizade, a 16-year-old Afghan, one of a group of migrants packed into one of three taxis that were parked on a highway on the outskirts of Istanbul.
""We've been living in Istanbul. We want to go to Edirne and then on to Greece,"" he said in fluent Turkish, before the taxis headed for the northwestern province of Edirne.
Further south, on Turkey's Aegean coast, Turkish broadcasters showed two dozen people, including women and children, aboard a rubber dinghy boat, reportedly bound for the Greek island of Lesbos.
Turkey's decision to make good on long-standing threats by President Tayyip Erdogan to ""open the gates"" to Europe came after 33 Turkish troops were killed in an air strike by Syrian government forces in Syria's northwestern Idlib region.
Some one million civilians have been displaced in Syria near Turkey since December as Russian-backed Syrian government forces seized territory from Turkish-backed Syrian rebels, creating the worst humanitarian crisis in the nine-year war.
Turkey already hosts some 3.7 million Syrian refugees and says it cannot handle any more.
The EU said on Friday it had received no official word from Ankara that it had suspended the 2016 deal, under which Brussels sends billions of euros in aid in return for Turkey stemming the migrant flow to Europe."

OUTSIDE SARAQEB, Syria/ANKARA (Reuters) - Refugees in Turkey headed towards European frontiers on Friday after an official declared that borders had been thrown open, a response to the escalating war in Syria where 33 Turkish soldiers were killed by Russian-backed Syrian government troops.
Moscow and Ankara traded blame over the strike in northwest Syria, the deadliest attack suffered by Turkey's army in nearly 30 years. The U.N. Security Council called an emergency meeting to avert open conflict between Russia and NATO member Turkey.
Greece and Bulgaria reinforced their borders in response to Turkey's threat to reopen the frontier, shut under an agreement that halted the migration crisis of 2015-2016, when more than a million people crossed into Europe by foot.
""We have decided, effective immediately, not to stop Syrian refugees from reaching Europe by land or sea,"" a senior Turkish official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
""All refugees, including Syrians, are now welcome to cross into the European Union,"" the official said, adding that police and border guards had been stood down.
Within hours, a column of dozens of migrants was heading on foot towards the European frontier in the early morning light. A man carried a small child in his arms. Others rode in taxis.
""We heard about it on the television,"" said Afghan migrant Sahin Nebizade, 16, in a group packed into taxis on a highway.
At the Pazarkule border post with Greece, scores of migrants faced barbed wire fences and smoke grenades. Some stuck in the no-man's land between the two countries tried to return to the Turkish side to escape the smoke, only to be turned back.
Hamid Muhammed, who carried a young girl, said he had been turned back by Greek police: ""We want the Turkish and European governments to open this gate.""
Greece's prime minister said no unauthorized crossing would be allowed. Bulgaria's prime minister said the prospect of a new migration crisis was even more of a threat when European countries were struggling to respond to the coronavirus.
The EU and the United Nations refugee agency noted that reports of a change in Turkish policy at the border were still unofficial and Ankara had not made any formal announcement. 
A MILLION DISPLACED 
Inside Syria there was ample evidence of the renewed fighting that has brought on perhaps the worst humanitarian crisis of the entire nine-year-old war. A million civilians have been displaced since December inside Syria near the Turkish border in desperate winter conditions. Turkey, already home to 3.7 million Syrian refugees, says it cannot take more. 
Reuters journalists at the front line saw huge clouds of white smoke as government forces struck the town of Saraqeb, an important crossroads captured by rebels this week in a rare push-back against the government's advance.
Rebel fighters sped down highways in pick-up trucks with artillery mounted in the beds. In the provincial capital Idlib, wounded fighters in jeans and camouflage jackets were carried into a clinic on trollies.
Syria's civil war has worsened dramatically in recent months despite largely vanishing Western countries' agenda. Government forces, backed by Russian air power, have launched an assault to capture the northwest, the last remaining territory held by rebels backed by Turkey.
With diplomacy sponsored by Ankara and Moscow in tatters, Turkey has come closer than ever to direct confrontation with Russia on the battlefield.
Presidents Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone on Friday. The Kremlin said they agreed on the need for a new arrangement to avert clashes. Turkey said the leaders agreed to meet as soon as possible.
""There is a risk of sliding into a major open international military confrontation. It is also causing unbearable humanitarian suffering and putting civilians in danger,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Twitter. 
The return of refugees to the frontier was a reminder of Western Europe's biggest migration since World War Two: the 2015-2016 crisis when 4,000 people drowned trying to reach Greece before Turkey shut the border in return for EU cash. 
""At a time when we are imposing stricter border monitoring over the coronavirus, imagine if we have an inflow of hundreds of thousands of migrants,"" Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said. ""We cannot afford that.""
Turkey, long the main ally of rebels battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, has recently sent thousands of troops and heavy military hardware into Idlib.
Erdogan has said Turkey will repel Assad's forces unless they pull back from Turkish posts. The United Nations has urged a ceasefire. 
Thursday's air strike was the worst on Turkey's military since a 1993 attack by Kurdish separatists.
Turkey's defense minister said it occurred despite coordination with Russia. Moscow said the Turkish troops should not have been in the area, and Ankara had failed to say where they were.

The United States, which has troops in another part of Syria, expressed solidarity with ""our NATO ally Turkey"".

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia edged nearer a political turning point on Friday with uncertainty over the fate of both 94-year-old Mahathir Mohammed and rival-turned-ally Anwar Ibrahim, 72, who have vied for power for a generation.
A week of turmoil was triggered by Mahathir's surprise resignation as prime minister, breaking an alliance with Anwar that won an election in 2018 against the corruption-tarnished former ruling party of six decades.
In the race for the premiership, former interior minister Muhyiddin Yassin, 72, has emerged as a leading candidate. From Mahathir's camp, he also has the backing of the old ruling party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).
""The nation’s fate hangs in the balance,"" said Liew Chin Tong, a member of Anwar's alliance. ""All MPs and parties will have to ask the question, who do they want to work with?""
A bigger role for UMNO, which supports Malay nationalism, could mean a swing back towards an establishment that puts greater emphasis on the interest of the majority ethnic group in the Southeast Asian country of 32 million.
The drama intensified on Friday when the royal palace rejected interim Prime Minister Mahathir's announcement that parliament would choose a new premier on Monday - a vote that might have helped him consolidate power.
Mahathir's proposed unity government had been rejected by Anwar, whose supporters argue that he should be given the chance to tell the king he could form a government because his alliance has more seats than others.
Anwar said his Pakatan Harapan coalition ""has the numbers"" among the 222 elected members of parliament.
""All the MPs pledging for me have done so as individuals,"" Anwar said on Twitter. ""I know for a fact that some of the MPs on the ‘other side’ are unhappy that their party leaders have stolen their voice. Let’s see out this democratic process.""
But as parties scrambled to find allies on Friday, some Anwar supporters conceded in private that Muhyiddin might edge him out.
""It's doubtful for us,"" said one lawmaker from Anwar's alliance, speaking on condition of anonymity.
MAHATHIR-BACKED CANDIDATE ADVANCES
The power struggle between Mahathir and Anwar has shaped Malaysian politics since the 1990s.
In an alliance with his long-time rival, Mahathir left retirement in 2018 to win back the post he held from 1981-2003, defeating UMNO's then prime minister Najib Razak, who is on trial for corruption.
But tension persisted over Mahathir's promise to one day hand power to Anwar. No precise date for that was ever set, and Anwar's chances of finally getting the premiership appeared to recede as key political blocs swung behind Muhyiddin. 
Islamist party PAS joined UMNO in backing Muhyiddin.
Gabungan Parti Sarawak, a coalition based in Sarawak on the island of Borneo, was also likely to back Muhyiddin, a senior party official said. In exchange the party would seek greater autonomy for the energy-rich region.
Anwar, who has twice been jailed on sodomy charges he denied and said were politically motivated, has won support from Malaysians seeking change with his battle cry of ""Reform"".
However, he been less trusted by traditionalists who fear losing out to large minority ethnic Chinese and Indian groups.
In a sign of the shifting political landscape, local media reported the resignation of attorney general Tommy Thomas, who had brought the corruption charges against Najib and other members of the former UMNO administration.
His appointment had been challenged by some Malay nationalists because of his Indian origins.
The political uncertainty comes at a testing time for Malaysia's economy, which has been flagging as it deals with fallout from the coronavirus epidemic.
The main stock index (KLSE) plunged 12% this week, its sharpest weekly fall since 2011, as global indices also dived.

On Thursday, the British government said it would walk away from talks on future ties with the EU if ""good progress"" was not made in the negotiations by June, and underlined that its goal was to gain political and economic independence from the bloc. 
Britain left the EU last month and the two sides have until the end of the year to negotiate a trade deal and agreements on everything from fishing to transport, to replace more than 40 years of closely aligned relations.
But before talks begin on Monday in Brussels, both sides are far apart, with Britain's main demand for an off-the-peg free trade deal rejected by the EU, which says the two neighbors have a unique relationship that requires shared rules.
""We do not accept time pressure and we are not ready to sign any kind of a deal on 31st December at 11pm,"" Montchalin told an audience at the Chatham House think-tank in London.
""We cannot let our level of ambition be affected by what I can call artificial deadlines. If the UK decides to shorten the negotiation period, it will be the UK's responsibility. It will not be our choice on the European side and that choice will have consequences in terms of the breadth and depth of the relationship we can build.""
Both sides say they want a deal to be agreed before Dec. 31, 2020, a deadline Britain has said it is not willing to extend, and Montchalin said she believed that was possible if there was an understanding of what could be achieved in that time.
She appealed to London to apply ""reason"" to the talks, warning Britain not to try to pursue a strategy of divide and rule with the 27-member EU.
""You should not underestimate the unity of the 27,"" she said. ""To those who might think that the EU's unity might falter in the next phase of talks, let me say you are in for the opposite.

""Our shared interest I think, from now on is not to show our muscles but is to work together, not with passion but with reason.""

Delphin Kahimbi was also under European Union sanctions over alleged human rights abuses when he commanded operations against rebels in east Democratic Republic of Congo in the 200Os and during his tenure as military intelligence chief.
Kahimbi was appointed by former President Joseph Kabila, and his successor as head of state, Felix Tshisekedi, had been under pressure from the United States to hold the general to account for alleged human rights abuses.
""He had a heart attack at home and he died soon after we arrived at the hospital,"" his wife, Brenda Kahimbi, told Reuters by phone.

Residents said the shelling was among the hardest since the two sides said they had agreed a ceasefire in January, as blasts of artillery echoed in the city center and black smoke billowed near Mitiga airport held by the government.
The fighting, between the Libyan National Army (LNA) of eastern-based leader Khalifa Haftar and the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) based in Tripoli, came as the United Nations tried to hold peace talks in Geneva.
Shelling of Mitiga airport has forced a suspension of flights for hours at a time on consecutive days this week and new damage to a hangar was visible after Friday's bombardment.
The town council of Abu Salim, a Tripoli neighborhood, posted pictures of damaged houses on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), saying a woman and child had been taken to hospital.
The LNA is backed by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, while the GNA is supported by Turkey and allied fighters it has brought from Syria. Haftar began his attack on Tripoli last year in the latest round of fighting in Libya since the 2011 toppling of strongman Muammar Gaddafi."

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somali troops clashed with a regional militia on Friday in one of the most serious outbreaks of fighting yet over political rivalries that Washington says are slowing the war against al Qaeda-linked insurgents.
Eleven people were killed in the violence, witnesses said.
Tension spilled over on Thursday evening between the Somali National Army and the Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama'a (ASWJ) militia, a group of moderate Sufi Muslims which has played a key role in the fight against the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgency.
Clashes began in Dhusamareb, administrative capital of central Somalia's Galmudug state, and spread to Guriel town, 60 km (40 miles) away, on Friday, residents said.
One resident said government forces had attacked a house where prominent ASWJ leaders live, and the two sides were fighting with mortars and anti-aircraft guns in the city center. 
""After 11 years of peace, Dhusamareb city today is hell,"" Halima Farah told Reuters by phone, adding that she and her four children were cowering inside their flimsy house. ""We are holding our children's hands but we have no way out.""
Al Shabaab has been fighting the internationally-recognized Somali government since 2008. The militants have also attacked American military bases as well as bars, hotels, a shopping mall and a university in Kenya and Uganda. Two years ago, an al Shabaab truck bomb in Mogadishu killed around 500 civilians. 
Somali government troops, supported by a 21,000-strong African Union peacekeeping force, launched a limited offensive against al Shabaab last year. But a top American diplomat said progress had petered out with the internal rivalries.
""The operation has stalled,"" Rodney Hunter, the U.S. political coordinator to the United Nations, told the Security Council this week. ""It is imperative that federal government and federal member states' security services focus on combating al-Shabaab, rather than engaging in armed conflict with each other to resolve political disputes."" 
Competition for political control and international security funds lie at the heart of the conflict. 
Some regional states accuse the government of meddling in local elections to entrench allies ahead of national elections scheduled for this year. They also want a larger slice of the hundreds of millions of dollars that foreign donors spend annually on Somali security forces. 
The federal government wants to keep control of those funds, saying it fears the balkanization of the country, and accuses some state authorities of behaving like warlords.
Tensions were high between Mogadishu and regional authorities in Kismayo during elections in Jubbaland, along the Kenyan border, in August. There was a small clash in neighboring Gedo earlier this year, and what Hunter described as a ""politically motivated offensive ... that diverts resources"" from fighting al Shabaab. 
Galmudug, scene of the latest fighting, has three rival politicians all claiming to be its leader. Ahmed Abdi Kariye, who is backed by the federal government, said ASWJ forces had started the fighting by firing on a checkpoint.
ASWJ leaders said the first provocation came from the government.
""We sacrificed our wealth and lives to liberate these areas from the terrorist al Shabaab... (but) the Somali government forces openly attacked Inji house, which is a home for ASWJ leaders,"" ASWJ leader Sheikh Mohamed Shakir Ali Hassan, who also says he is leader of the state, said late Thursday. 
""We have one enemy and that is al Shabaab. Let's jointly fight the terrorists.""
Omar Mahmood, an analyst from the Brussels-based International Crisis Group, said the power struggles were likely to continue. 

""I'm not optimistic,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - London's Court of Appeal ruled on Friday that two judgments in the legal battle between Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, and his former wife over the wardship of their two children should be made public.
Mohammed had said that the judgments of Andrew McFarlane, president of London's High Court Family Division, in the case involving Princess Haya bint al-Hussein, half-sister of Jordan's King Abdullah, were wrong in law and should not be publicized. 
""The unanimous decision of the court is that these appeals should be dismissed,"" said Justice Nicholas Underhill, vice-president of the Court of Appeal.
""This means, subject to one important proviso, that both judgments, and the judgment on the question of publication, can be published.""
The three Court of Appeal judges refused permission for Mohammed's legal team to appeal to the Supreme Court, saying their reasons would be given next week. 
However, they agreed that McFarlane's rulings should not be made public until at least Tuesday at 1600 GMT to allow an application to be made directly to the United Kingdom's highest judicial body.
The contest in the British court began last May and there have been a number of private hearings at London's High Court before McFarlane which have been subject to strict reporting restrictions.
Mohammed, 70, had appealed against publication of two judgments by McFarlane on ""fact-finding"" and ""assurances and waivers"", after he decided last month that these should be made public.
Princess Haya, 45-year-old daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan, and the court-appointed guardian of the children both supported publication, the court heard.
WARDSHIP
On Wednesday, Underhill said the judgments ""raise matters of public interest beyond the particular issue in the wardship proceedings"".
""The first concerned certain disputed factual issues; the second concerned issues arising out of the special position of the father as the sovereign and head of government of a foreign state,"" he added.
The two parties said in a statement in July that the case did not concern divorce or finances but was limited to their children's welfare.
The sheikh has applied to the court for the summary return of his children to Dubai. Princess Haya has asked the court to protect one of the children from a forced marriage and to grant a non-molestation order, a type of injunction that protects against harassment or threats.
The wardship proceedings are still ongoing and there will be a ""welfare hearing"" at the end of next month, Underhill said.
The sheikh, vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, has not attended the court in person, with David Pannick, who successfully represented anti-Brexit campaigners in two high-profile court victories over the government last year, leading his legal team. 
British-educated Haya, who is half-sister to King Abdullah, has attended all the hearings accompanied by Fiona Shackleton, the lawyer who represented Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, in his divorce from his late first wife, Princess Diana.
Mohammed has more than 20 children by different wives, and married the princess in 2004 in what was believed to be his sixth marriage. 

Witnesses in the case have included the British detective who led an investigation into the disappearance of Shamsa, the sheikh's daughter from another marriage, from Cambridge in 2000, and Tiina Jauhiainen, who says she tried to help her friend Latifa, Shamsa's younger sister, flee Dubai in 2018.

KABUL/DOHA (Reuters) - Afghan officials met Taliban members in Qatar on Friday to discuss a prisoner swap plan ahead of the U.S. and Taliban deal that will set the timeline for the withdrawal of American troops who have been fighting in Afghanistan for 18 years.
The meeting in Doha was part of crucial confidence-building mechanism between the warring sides, two senior government officials in Kabul said.
The Taliban wants the release of over 5,000 detainees before launching direct negotiations with the Afghan side for a permanent ceasefire, a stumbling block in efforts to end the war. 
A senior Taliban leader in Doha said both sides were working on ""different angles to overcome the difference on prisoner swap"".
The Afghan delegation has no authority to agree on a prisoner swap. It will consult and report back to the president, another official said
Shepherding the Afghan government and Taliban towards intra-Afghan negotiations has been one of the biggest headaches for U.S. negotiators, according to western diplomats.
A senior official in Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's office said Ghani was reluctant to send a delegation to discuss the prisoner swap with the Taliban before the U.S.-Taliban deal is formalised as Afghanistan is not a signatory to that bilateral agreement.
""But he now realises that a meeting is crucial at this juncture. This golden opportunity cannot be lost,"" said the official, requesting anonymity.
The seven-day ""Reduction in Violence"" (RIV) pact that took effect on Feb. 22 and is set to culminate in the signing of an agreement between top U.S. and Taliban negotiators on Saturday in Doha, the Taliban's political headquarters.
The RIV period has passed off largely successfully, and the United States and Taliban look set to sign the agreement to establish a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops in exchange for guarantees from the Taliban not to allow militant groups such as al-Qaeda to operate in Afghanistan.
Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesman for the President Ashraf Ghani said RIV has been an important step towards an enduring ceasefire as the number of attacks have been low by the Taliban.
""Our monitoring groups will provide us with their assessment of the week. We hope that RIV continues after signing of U.S., Taliban agreement, leading to a ceasefire.""
The Taliban now hold sway over half the country, and are at their most powerful since the U.S. invasion in 2001.
The U.S.-Taliban agreement, if inked on Saturday, would begin a phased withdrawal of American and coalition forces and would also require the Taliban to initiate a formal dialogue with the Afghan government and other political and civil society groups on a permanent nationwide ceasefire and power-sharing in post-war Afghanistan.
Taliban commanders said once the deal is signed the group will release 1,000 Afghan prisoners. In exchange, the Taliban expects the Afghan government to release their 5,000 fighters.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian police said on Friday they had detained hundreds of people and were keeping a heavy presence in northeast New Delhi, days after the worst bout of sectarian violence in the capital in decades.
At least 38 people were killed in Hindu-Muslim violence this week, police said, amid mounting international criticism that authorities failed to protect minority Muslims.
Media said the toll was likely to rise.
Delhi police spokesman M.S. Randhawa said police were collecting evidence, reviewing video footage of the violence and had already detained more than 600 people.
""The detentions were important to bring the situation under control,"" Randhawa told reporters, adding that there had been no new reports of violence.
The clashes began over a citizenship law that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government introduced in December providing a path to Indian citizenship for six religious groups from neighboring countries - but not Muslims. 
Critics say the law is discriminatory and comes on top of other measures such as withdrawal of autonomy for Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir that has deepened disquiet about the future of India's 200 million Muslims.
Critics of the government however blamed this week's violence on members of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was trounced in local Delhi elections at the beginning of the month. The BJP has denied the allegations.
The violence morphed into street battles between Hindu and Muslim groups with the police largely ineffective in ending the violence.
The Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) has condemned the violence against Muslims and vandalism of mosques and Muslim-owned properties.
U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders accused President Donald Trump of failing on the issue of human rights after he refused to be drawn into criticizing New Delhi for its handling of the violence.

Trump was on a state visit to India when the violence broke out.

Parliament approved the coalition in the early hours of Thursday after a day of debate, ending months of political wrangling that has slowed the North African country's efforts to tackle looming economic problems. 
""Our country is tired of frequent changes of governments in the past nine years... we want political stability,"" Fakhfkah said at his‮ ‬signing-ceremony. 
Although Tunisia has managed to move peacefully to democracy after throwing off autocratic rule in the 2011 revolution that triggered the ""Arab spring"", nine successive governments have failed to tackle social hardship and unemployment. 
Fakhfakh, who was designated prime minister last month by President Kais Saied, has brought parties from across the political spectrum into his cabinet - and they continue to disagree on several big policy areas.
The new government must tackle high public spending and politically sensitive reforms to energy subsidies and state firms.

CONAKRY (Reuters) - When Alpha Conde was elected president of Guinea in 2010, the veteran opposition leader vowed to restore democracy after decades of authoritarian rule.
Ten years later, many fear Conde, who turns 82 next week, is laying the groundwork to cling to power himself by holding a referendum on Sunday that could extend his rule for 12 more years, risking mass unrest and the health of the mining economy.
The new constitution would impose a limit of two six-year terms, up from the current two five-year terms. It does not specify whether terms served under the previous constitution would count, but Conde has suggested they would not.
At least 30 people have died since October in protests against the proposed constitutional changes and many are bracing for more trouble on Sunday. The outcome could be a bellwether for a presidential election before year's end in the country, the largest African producer of the main aluminum ore, bauxite.
The opposition is boycotting the referendum and simultaneous legislative elections, which it says will be a sham, and leading members have said they will prevent voting, without saying how.
In the capital Conakry this week, pick-ups full of police and soldiers patrolled the streets past billboards urging people to vote yes. The government ordered schools closed for several days, and residents of opposition strongholds were stocking up on food.
""I have my voter's card but I don't know yet if I am going to vote,"" said Aissatou Diallo, a doctor from the Dabompa neighborhood. ""I fear that there will be violence, even if the security forces are massively deployed.""
The United States, European Union and former colonial power France, have voiced concerns. Earlier this week, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, an organization of French-speaking governments, withdrew its poll-monitoring mission, citing the presence of 2.49 million ""problematic"" entries on the electoral register.
ETHNIC DIVISIONS
Conde has refused to rule out using the new constitution as a reset button on his mandate, which expires in December, citing other African countries as examples of where leaders have made political maneuvers to extend their rule.
In neighboring Ivory Coast, President Alassane Ouattara says a constitutional change in 2016 means he can stand for a third term in October. His opponents dispute that, and Ouattara has not yet said whether he will stand.
Several other leaders in West and Central Africa have altered constitutions to hang onto power.
Conde, who as an opposition leader was sentenced to death in absentia under one president and imprisoned under another, says the new constitution is badly needed to replace a 2010 version that was hastily drafted during military rule and defended his right to stand for a third term if nominated by his party.
His allies have touted progressive reforms, including a ban on female genital mutilation, compulsory education and new environmental laws.
The violence during recent protests has been largely limited to opposition strongholds, but U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet warned about the risk of wider unrest.
""Ethnic divisions are deepening, with increasing incitement to hatred and violence on social media and at political rallies,"" she said in a speech on Thursday.
The opposition boycott all but ensures the new constitution will be approved. However, even some Conde supporters said they hoped he would not run again.
""The president must now think about his succession,"" said Mamady Kallo, a diamond broker, who said he would vote yes in the referendum. ""He can choose a young person from his entourage to pursue the good work he has done in this country."""

The Constitutional Court dissolved the opposition Future Forward Party, the third-largest in parliament, and banned 11 of its lawmakers from politics for a decade on the grounds the party breached the law by taking loans from its leader.
The court's decision has sparked protests by university students around the country.
Prayuth had been expected to survive the censure motion even before the reduction in opposition numbers in parliament.
But he faced some of the fiercest public criticism since he transitioned last year from military ruler to head of an elected government.
Opposition lawmakers accused his former junta of helping Malaysia's former government cover up the multi-million-dollar 1MDB scandal and also of using army personnel to conduct online trolling and harassment of opponents, charges Prayuth and the army have denied.
Friday's vote was 272 in favor of Prayuth with 49 votes against, while the other five cabinet ministers also survived the votes in similarly overwhelming fashion. The opposition needed 245 out of the existing 488 parliamentary seats to vote out the prime minister.
The 135 lawmakers from Pheu Thai Party, the largest opposition party, boycotted the vote in protest against the government for not allowing them to extend the time of the censure debate.
Remaining lawmakers from the disbanded Future Forward did not boycott the Friday vote after its supporters used the hashtag #IOrderYouToGoBackToParliament on social media to voice their disagreement with Pheu Thai's boycott decision."

MANILA (Reuters) - A U.S.-Philippines troop agreement recently scrapped by President Rodrigo Duterte could still be salvaged, a senior diplomat said on Friday, boosting hopes in both countries of retaining one of Asia's oldest military alliances. 
Talks were taking place to find a solution, but the alliance would prevail, recognizing the importance of the United States as a global power, said Jose Manuel Romualdez, Philippine ambassador to Washington.
""From what I'm told, the door is not totally shut,"" he told a forum.
Romualdez said both countries were looking at how they can ""polish"" and ""improve"" the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), with a Philippines troop pact with Australia and a similar agreement in the works with Japan possible templates. 
The mercurial Duterte caused a stir earlier this month by serving notice of the VFA's termination, demonstrating his fury over the rescinding of a U.S. travel visa for his former police chief due to human rights concerns by some U.S. lawmakers.
The VFA, which would end in August, provides rules for the rotation of thousands of American troops in and out of the Philippines for war games and scores of annual exercises.
His opponents were outraged at what they saw as a show of petulance, and some lawmakers who typically side with Duterte urged him to reconsider a move that could weaken an under-resourced military stretched constantly by natural disasters and Maoist and Islamist rebellions. 
Philippine efforts to protect the alliance underscore contrasting opinions within the Duterte administration and legislature about his foreign policy trajectory, especially over his openly hostile approach towards the United States, where relatives of millions of Filipinos live.
Absent free movement of U.S. personnel, experts say two other joint defense agreements would be meaningless and efforts to procure and operate U.S. defense hardware could become difficult. 
It would also reduce Washington's options in the Pacific region, with complications over a longstanding U.S. troop presence in Japan and South Korea, and only limited engagements for the U.S. military elsewhere in Southeast Asia.
The other source of foreign policy friction in the Philippines is Duterte's fondness for China, which many Filipinos view with scepticism due to a history of perceived maritime encroachments.
Retired supreme court judge Antonio Carpio, a staunch critic of China's efforts to dominate in the South China Sea, said maintaining defense ties with the United States were vital to keeping Beijing in check.

""The only ally we can hope to deter China is the U.S,"" he told the forum.

SHANGHAI/LONDON (Reuters) - A growing number of discharged coronavirus patients in China and elsewhere are testing positive after recovering, sometimes weeks after being allowed to leave the hospital, which could make the epidemic harder to eradicate.
On Wednesday, the Osaka prefectural government in Japan said a woman working as a tour-bus guide had tested positive for the coronavirus for a second time. This followed reports in China that discharged patients throughout the country were testing positive after their release from the hospital.
An official at China's National Health Commission said on Friday that such patients have not been found to be infectious.
Experts say there are several ways discharged patients could fall ill with the virus again. Convalescing patients might not build up enough antibodies to develop immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and are being infected again. The virus also could be ""biphasic"", meaning it lies dormant before creating new symptoms.
But some of the first cases of ""reinfection"" in China have been attributed to testing discrepancies.
On Feb. 21, a discharged patient in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu was readmitted 10 days after being discharged when a follow-up test came back positive.
Lei Xuezhong, the deputy director of the infectious diseases center at the West China Hospital, told People's Daily that hospitals were testing nose and throat samples when deciding whether patients should be discharged, but new tests were finding the virus in the lower respiratory tract.
Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain's University of East Anglia who has been closely following the outbreak, told Reuters that although the patient in Osaka could have relapsed, it is also possible that the virus was still being released into her system from the initial infection, and she wasn't tested properly before she was discharged.
The woman first tested positive in late January and was discharged from the hospital on Feb. 1, leading some experts to speculate that it was biphasic, like anthrax.
A Journal of the American Medical Association study of four infected medical personnel treated in Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, said it was likely that some recovered patients would remain carriers even after meeting discharge criteria.
In China, for instance, patients must test negative, show no symptoms and have no abnormalities on X-rays before they are discharged.
Allen Cheng, professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at Monash University in Melbourne, said it wasn't clear whether the patients were re-infected or had remained ""persistently positive"" after their symptoms disappeared. But he said the details of the Japan case suggested the patient had been reinfected.
Song Tie, vice director of the local disease control center in southern China's Guangdong province, told a media briefing on Wednesday that as many as 14% of discharged patients in the province have tested positive again and had returned to hospitals for observation.
He said one good sign is that none of those patients appear to have infected anyone else.
""From this understanding ... after someone has been infected by this kind of virus, he will produce antibodies, and after these antibodies are produced, he won't be contagious,"" he said.
Normally, convalescing patients will develop specific antibodies that render them immune to the virus that infected them, but reinfection is not impossible, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a specialist in infectious diseases at the University of Sydney.
""In most cases though, because their body has developed an immune response to the first infection, the second infection is usually less severe,"" Kamradt-Scott said.
Other experts have also raised the possibility of ""antibody-dependent enhancement"", which means exposure to viruses might make patients more at risk of further infections and worse symptoms.
China has so far discharged 36,117 patients, according to data from the National Health Commission released on Friday, which represents almost 46% of the total cases on the Chinese mainland. If the 14% rate of reinfection is accurate and remains consistent, it could pose a wider health risk.
""I would say that it is less about if it is possible that re-infection can occur than how often it occurs,"" Cheng said."

BRISTOL, England (Reuters) - Greta Thunberg, the teenage activist who has reprimanded governments across the world for failing her generation with climate change, is expected to draw a crowd of thousands on Friday when she leads a protest in Britain.
Known simply as Greta, 17-year-old Thunberg has captured the imagination of many young people with impassioned demands for world leaders to take urgent action to prevent what she says will be an environmental cataclysm.
She will address a ""Youth Strike for Climate"" rally in the English city of Bristol, though police issued a safety warning due to the number of people expected to attend.
""The world’s youth are waking up and taking action on the climate crisis,"" said the event organizers, the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate group, which insisted it had prepared properly and did not need to be ""patronised"" by safety worries.
The group is part of a global movement of school students who stage protests in school time over what they say is the lack of government action on climate change.
Britain is targeting net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and wants to bring forward a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2035 at the latest. 
Organizers say they expect between 15,000 and 60,000 protesters from across the country to attend the event on Friday.
One coach company said it was providing transport from 13 places around Britain, including Oxford, Birmingham, Brighton and Cardiff.
Police and the local council in Bristol issued a joint statement, expressing safety concerns.
""We have seen a number of protests over the last year however this one will be significantly larger,"" it said. ""Please do not underestimate the scale of this protest.""
Police will close roads around the area where Thunberg, is expected to speak before she joins a march through the city.
Thunberg has been in Britain since the weekend. On Tuesday she visited the University of Oxford, where she met Malala Yousafzai, the 22-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner and campaigner for girls' education, who is studying there.
The pair shared photos of themselves with their arms around each other. Thunberg called Yousafzai her role model, while Yousafzai said on Twitter: ""She's the only friend I'd skip school for.""

Thunberg starting missing lessons two years ago to protest outside the Swedish parliament building. She has since sparked a global movement calling for sustainability and awareness of climate change.

Lai was seen by a Reuters reporter leaving the Kowloon City police station in a black Mercedes on Friday. He gave no comment.
""The charges will not hinder our fight for democracy, freedom and our human right to continue to gather, march and protest,"" Lee told reporters in front of the Cheung Sha Wan police station. 
Lai and Yeung could not be reached immediately for comment.
ARRESTS CRITICIZED
The arrests come after a period of relative calm in the Asian financial hub following months of intense anti-government protests. 
Hong Kong saw one of its worst clashes on Aug. 31, with police firing tear gas and water cannons at pro-democracy protesters who threw petrol bombs.
Authorities in Hong Kong have arrested more than 7,000 people for their involvement in the protests, many on charges of rioting that can carry jail terms of up to 10 years. It is unclear how many are still in custody.
Public anger has grown over the months due to perceptions of China tightening its grip over the city. Beijing denies meddling and blames the West for fomenting unrest.
Lai was previously arrested in 2014 for refusing to leave a key pro-democracy protest site in the center of the city. Following his arrest he resigned as editor in chief of Apple Daily. He has also come under scrutiny from Hong Kong's anti-graft agency when they raided his home in 2014.
Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement it was concerned about the arrests and called on the Hong Kong authorities to ensure freedoms like the right to protest enshrined in the city's basic law are respected.
Amnesty International said the arrests were ""a shameless attempt to harass and silence those in Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement"" and called for an independent inquiry into police's handling of the protests - a core demand of protesters.
Police has repeatedly said it has acted with restraint and has used minimum levels of force. 
Hong Kong Democracy Council, a Washington based non- government organization, said on Friday that the arrests were ""blatant acts of political suppression by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Communist Party"".
The group said in a statement it was demanding the immediate and unconditional release of Lai and the other pro-democracy activists.

The government did not have an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in's approval rating have dropped to their lowest since November, a poll showed on Friday, amid growing criticism of his government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
South Korea reported 256 new virus cases on Friday, bringing its total to 2,022, the most infections outside China, where the virus emerged late last year.
Realmeter, which surveyed some 1,500 people on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Moon's popularity fell to 44.7%, down from about 50% before the country confirmed its first case of virus infection on Jan. 20.
It also marked the lowest since November, when North Korea fired a series of missiles and signs of friction emerged with the United States over policy on Japan and a bilateral defense cost-sharing deal, the Seoul-based pollster said.
Some of the biggest drops in Moon's ratings came from the southeastern city of Daegu, where a church at the center of the virus outbreak is located, and North Gyeongsang Province, which has the second highest number of cases.
Sudden surges in infections over the past week have triggered criticism of the government, particularly a decision not to impose a blanket ban on people entering from China in favor of limiting arrivals.
The deteriorating sentiment has prompted more than 1.2 million people to sign a petition demanding Moon's impeachment.
Moon's office, which had promised to respond to any petition gathering 100,000 or more signatures, said it was working on an answer."

ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey will no longer stop Syrian refugees from reaching Europe, a senior Turkish official said, as Ankara responded on Friday to the killing of 33 Turkish soldiers in an air strike by Syrian government forces in Syria's northwestern Idlib region.
President Tayyip Erdogan chaired an emergency meeting on the attack in Ankara overnight, while Defence Minister Hulusi Akar and Turkish force commanders directed operations in Syria at the Turkish border, state-owned Anadolu news agency said.
Turkey has sent thousands of troops and heavy military hardware into Syria and Erdogan has warned that Turkey would launch a full-scale offensive to repel Syrian forces unless they pulled back from Turkish observation posts in the region.
The killing of 33 Turkish soldiers and wounding of 32, announced by the governor in Turkey's Hatay province bordering Syria, raised the Turkish military death toll in the region to 54 this month.
Turkey's communications director, Fahrettin Altun, said that in retaliation, ""all known"" Syrian government targets were being fired on by Turkish air and land support units.
Details of the retaliation were not immediately clear.
Some one million civilians have been displaced near the Turkish border since December as Russia-backed Syrian government forces seized territory from Turkey-backed Syrian rebels, marking the worst humanitarian crisis in the nine-year war.
In anticipation of the imminent arrival of refugees from Idlib, Turkish police, coastguard and border security officials have been ordered to stand down on refugees' land and sea crossings, the Turkish official told Reuters.
""We have decided, effectively immediately, not to stop Syrian refugees from reaching Europe by land or sea,"" said the official, who requested anonymity.
""All refugees, including Syrians, are now welcome to cross into the European Union.""
'DESPICABLE OFFENSIVE'
The threat to open the way for refugees to Europe would, if executed, reverse a pledge Turkey made to the European Union in 2016 and could quickly draw Western powers into the standoff over Idlib and stalled negotiations between Ankara and Moscow.
The burden of hosting refugees ""is too heavy for any single country to carry"", the official said.
Turkey hosts some 3.7 million Syrian refugees and has repeated it cannot handle more. Under the 2016 deal, the European Union has provided billions of euros in aid in return for Ankara agreeing to stem the influx of migrants into Europe.
Hatay Governor Rahmi Dogan said none of the Turkish troops wounded in Thursday's air strike were in critical condition.
The U.S. State Department said the United States was very concerned about the reported attack on Turkish soldiers.
""We stand by our NATO ally Turkey and continue to call for an immediate end to this despicable offensive by the Assad regime, Russia, and Iranian-backed forces,"" a State Department representative said in a statement.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced ""grave concern"" about the escalation in northwest Syria and reports that Turkish soldiers had been killed, and repeated his call for an immediate ceasefire, a spokesman said.
Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump may hold a phone call to discuss Idlib after the attack on Turkish soldiers, two Turkish officials told Reuters.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, supported by relentless Russian air strikes, have pushed hard in recent months to retake the last large rebel-held region in northwest Syria.
The war in Syria has displaced millions and killed hundreds of thousands."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's deportation policy is so ""corrosive"" that it has soured its bilateral relationship with New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Friday, a rare bust-up between the two historic allies.
Australia's conservative government has in recent months moved to deport thousands of foreigners convicted of crimes as part of an immigration crackdown that can also strip dual-nationals of their Australian citizenship.
The move has seen hundreds of people deported to New Zealand, a country that some left when just children and have few ties to.
""We have countless who have no home in New Zealand, they have no network, they have grown up in Australia. That is their home. And that is where they should stay,"" Ardern told reporters in Sydney during a media conference alongside Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
""Do not deport your people and your problems.""
The two countries have fought in numerous conflicts alongside each other, and squabbles between the two rarely break-out beyond playful, light-hearted banter over sport and culture.
Roughly 650,000 New Zealand citizens - more than a tenth of the smaller country’s population - live in Australia.
Morrison, however, was unapologetic and promised no change in Australian policy.
""If you have committed a crime and you're not a citizen of Australia, then you have no right to stay,"" Morrison told the same media conference.
The disagreement comes as Ardern faces a tight race to keep her premiership when New Zealanders return to the polls on Sep 19.
Ardern is hugely popular among liberal voters globally thanks to her compassionate but decisive response to a mass shooting, her focus on climate change action and multilateralism, and her ability to combine motherhood and leadership.
But at home, slow economic growth and low business confidence, a failed state housing project and scandals sees her center-left Labour trailing the conservative National Party.

""The election is on the knife edge. The issue is extremely sensitive back home, so giving Australia a kick in the ribs can't hurt at all,"" said Peter Chen, a political science professor at University of Sydney.

(Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called women's inequality ""stupid"" and a cause for global shame on Thursday, as he pledged to press governments to end discriminatory laws in the face of a ""strong and relentless pushback"" against women's rights.
While Guterres did not name and shame, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has led a push at the U.N. against the promotion of sexual and reproductive health services for women because the administration sees that as code for abortion.
Speaking ahead of the annual meeting of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in New York next month, Guterres warned that the state of women's rights was dire and said he would seek to end ""default male thinking"" across the United Nations.
""Just as slavery and colonialism were a stain on previous centuries, women's inequality should shame us all in the 21st. Because it is not only unacceptable; it is stupid,"" Guterres said in a speech to The New School in New York.
He said legal protections against rape and domestic violence were being diluted or rolled back and that in 34 countries rape within marriage was still legal.
""There is a strong and relentless pushback against women's rights,"" Guterres said. ""Women's sexual and reproductive rights are under threat from different sides.""
Language promoting women's sexual and reproductive health is long-agreed internationally, including in resolutions adopted by the Security Council in 2009 and 2013 and several resolutions adopted annually by the 193-member General Assembly.
However, the United States under Trump has pushed to remove such language from new U.N. resolutions. The Trump administration also cut funding in 2017 for the U.N. Population Fund because it believed it was linked to an abortion program, but the U.N. said that was an inaccurate perception.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that women have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion but the issue is still divisive in the United States.
""The U.N. should not put itself in a position of promoting or suggesting a right to abortion, whether it is humanitarian or development work,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, said in October.
The United States has received support for its stance from countries including Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Guatemala, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Sudan, Uganda, Poland and Hungary.
""I find it pretty strange that the United States is mobilizing so hard on this issue ... because if you look at the bigger picture is the main threat to the world today abortions? Or is it an assertive China? A Russia that is expansionist? Let's just get our focus right here,"" said a senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Last year Washington threatened to veto a Security Council resolution if a reference was not cut citing the need for U.N. bodies and donors to give timely ""sexual and reproductive health"" assistance to survivors of sexual violence in conflict.
Guterres said on Thursday he would urge governments to achieve gender parity in senior leadership. He said he achieved gender parity among his senior leadership team - on Jan. 1, 90 women and 90 men were in the ranks of full-time senior leadership, two years ahead of the target date he set.
""Women have equaled and outperformed men in almost every sphere,"" he said. ""It is time to stop trying to change women, and start changing the systems that prevent them from achieving their potential."""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A Canadian government minister was scheduled to open two days of talks with a major indigenous group on Thursday in a bid to end three weeks of rail and road blockades across the country that are harming the economy.
Activists have disrupted passenger and freight traffic to show solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en people in the Pacific province of British Columbia, who are seeking to stop TC Energy Corp (TO:TRP) from building a gas pipeline over their land.
Carolyn Bennett, the minister of crown-indigenous relations, and Scott Fraser, the British Columbia minister of indigenous relations and reconciliation, are due to meet Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs on Thursday and Friday.
Ahead of the meeting the Wet'suwet'en chiefs issued a statement thanking supporters for ""their tireless dedication,"" saying they now needed time for talks with Bennett and Fraser in an atmosphere of respect.
""Pleased to have received this statement, and look forward to the important discussions this afternoon,"" Bennett said in a Twitter post.
The chiefs agreed to the talks after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police withdrew from Wet'suwet'en territory, where police had been enforcing court orders against demonstrators trying to stop the Coastal GasLink pipeline.
TC Energy said on Thursday it had suspended construction for two days to allow the talks to take place.
""We both want to achieve a resolution that will allow satisfaction on both sides,"" federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau told reporters Thursday. ""It's not going to happen necessarily overnight, but the beginning of this dialogue is something that is extremely important in sending a signal.""
Police in the eastern province of Ontario cleared protesters from a major Canadian National Railway Co (TO:CNR) line on Monday, allowing some shipments to resume.
Some activists, though, returned to the lines on Wednesday, standing on the tracks and lighting fires, actions that Garneau described as reckless and dangerous.
Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who says improving relations with aboriginal groups is a priority, had initially called for dialogue. But last Friday, after opposition legislators accused him of weakness and business groups warned of economic damage, Trudeau demanded aboriginal groups lift the blockades amid layoffs and shortages of goods like propane.

Garneau said on Wednesday that ""some of these effects are going to be felt for weeks and months to come.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A C-130 tanker plane that crashed and killed all three Americans on board while fighting fires in Australia last month hit the ground shortly after making a two-second fire retardant drop at an altitude of 200 feet, investigators said on Friday.
In a preliminary report into the crash, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said after the drop, the aircraft was flying at a very low height with its left wing down and it hit a tree before crashing into the ground, leading to a post-impact fuel fire.
No distress calls were made to air traffic control before the crash and an emergency dump of fire retardant had not been activated, according to the report, which said the nearby Cooma-Snowy Mountains Airport forecast warned of high winds, reduced visibility and severe turbulence at altitudes below 5,000 feet above ground level before the crash.
The preliminary report contained factual information and the sequence of events as understood so far but did not determine the cause, which remains under investigation.
""An investigation of this nature and complexity may take more than 18 months to complete,"" ATSB Chief Commissioner Greg Hood said in a statement. ""However, should any safety critical information be discovered at any time during the investigation, we will immediately notify operators and regulators, and make that publicly known.""
The crash of the plane, operated by private Canadian firm Coulson Aviation, killed U.S. military veterans Captain Ian H. McBeth, 44, of Great Falls, Montana, First Officer Paul Clyde Hudson, 42, of Buckeye, Arizona, and Flight Engineer Rick DeMorgan Jr., 43, of Navarre, Florida.
The cockpit voice recorder was recovered but investigators said the data was not useful because all of the audio was from a flight that was operated in the United States in 2019.
The aircraft had been based there before coming to Australia to help during a bushfire season that killed 33 people, charred nearly 12 million hectares (29.7 million acres) of land and wreaked billions of dollars in damage."
271,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 07:02PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. mulls using sweeping powers to ramp up production of coronavirus protective gear,"By Ted Hesson and Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration is considering invoking special powers through a law called the Defense Production Act to rapidly expand domestic manufacturing of protective masks and clothing to combat the coronavirus in the United States, two U.S. officials told Reuters.
The use of the law, passed by Congress in 1950 at the outset of the Korean War, would mark an escalation of the administration's response to the outbreak. The virus first surfaced in China and has since spread to other countries including the United States.
U.S. health officials have told Americans to begin preparing for the spread of the virus in the United States.
The law grants the president the power to expand industrial production of key materials or products for national security and other reasons. The biggest producers of face masks in the United States include 3M (NYSE:MMM) Corp and Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON).
Trump, a Republican seeking re-election on Nov. 3, has faced criticism from Democrats over his administration's response to the outbreak. 
Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar told lawmakers this week that the United States needs a stockpile of about 300 million N95 face masks - respiratory protective devices - for medical workers to combat the spread of the virus. The United States currently has only a fraction of that number available for immediate use, Azar testified. 
During an interagency call on Wednesday, officials from HHS and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) discussed the possibility of invoking the Defense Production Act for the manufacture of ""personal protective equipment"" that can be worn to prevent infection, according to a DHS official.
Such equipment can include masks, gloves and body suits.
Azar said at a congressional hearing on Wednesday that China controls ""a lot of the raw materials as well as the manufacturing capacity"" related to face masks.
""Very little of this stuff is apparently made in the (United) States, so if we're down to domestic capability to produce, it could get tough,"" the DHS official told Reuters.
A White House official confirmed that the administration was exploring the use of the law to spur manufacturing of protective gear. Both the DHS official and the White House requested anonymity to discuss the issue.
""Let's say 'Company A' makes a multitude of respiratory masks but they spend 80% of their assembly lines on masks that painters wear and only 20% on the N95,"" the White House official said. ""We will have the ability to tell corporations, 'No, you change your production line so it is now 80% of the N95 masks and 20% of the other.'""
""It allows you to basically direct things happening that need to get done,"" the official added.
HHS declined to comment. DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
'VERY LOW'
Trump said on Wednesday the coronavirus risk to the United States remained ""very low,"" but that federal health officials were prepared to take action and that Vice President Mike Pence would take control of the U.S. response.
Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, on Thursday accused Trump of ""towering and dangerous incompetence"" and said the president ""must get his act together"" on the coronavirus threat.
Invoking the Defense Production Act is one of a number of options under consideration by the administration to combat the virus, the officials said, and no final decision has been made. Trump invoked the law in 2017 to address technological shortfalls in a vaccine production capability and other items such as microelectronics.
The law grants the president broad authority to ""expedite and expand the supply of resources from the U.S. industrial base to support military, energy, space, and homeland security programs,"" according to a summary on the Federal Emergency Management Agency website.
Azar testified on Wednesday that the United States has a stockpile of around 12 million of the N95 masks that are in line with certifications from the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). HHS also has another 5 million N95 masks that are no longer NIOSH certified, Azar said, perhaps because they are past the expiration date.
In addition to those masks, the U.S. government has a stockpile of 30 million ""gauze type"" surgical masks, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said are less effective because they are loose-fitting.
Azar said the government needs a stockpile of approximately 300 million N95 masks.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in a written statement on Thursday that the agency had heard reports of increased market demand for some types of protective medical gear and ""supply challenges,"" but was not aware of specific shortages.
CDC Director Robert Redfield testified at a House subcommittee on Thursday that he would ask ordinary Americans not to buy N95 masks at this time.

""There's no role for these masks in the community,"" he said. ""These masks need to be prioritized for healthcare professionals.""

272,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 06:40PM ET</span>",A Delhi neighborhood divided by a highway and now hatred,"By Devjyot Ghoshal, Zeba Siddiqui and Aftab Ahmed
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Hindu area of Bhajanpura and Muslim quarter of Chand Bagh face each other across a wide thoroughfare running through the northeastern part of India's capital, New Delhi.
After days of deadly riots between members of the two communities, neighborhoods that lived happily together for years are now divided by far more than a road.
Mutual fear and suspicion have replaced generally cordial relations, a change that could make it harder to defuse tensions between India's Hindu majority and its sizeable Muslim minority that have worsened during months of street protests.
Some residents are trying to understand how a peaceful part of the Indian capital became a battleground virtually overnight.
By mid-week the main road was strewn with broken glass, bricks and the charred remains of destroyed cars.
At least 32 people died in the clashes, hundreds were wounded and buildings were torched in the worst sectarian violence in Delhi in decades. An uneasy calm had settled over the area by Thursday.
""I have lived here for 35 years,"" said Santosh Garg, a Hindu who described a narrow escape on Monday when a mob of Muslim men set her house alight.
""I have never had a problem, never had a complaint,"" the 52-year-old told Reuters, referring to her mostly Muslim neighbors across the way. ""I still can't understand what happened.""
Garg said she lowered her two grandchildren from a balcony and into the arms of police officers to get them away from the blaze. She herself jumped on to an adjoining terrace.
In the Muslim quarter a few hundred meters away, Rubina Bano said she was at an anti-government demonstration when police fired tear gas to break up the protest and a Hindu crowd started throwing stones.
Bano, who is three months pregnant, said she was beaten by police and needed 20 stitches in her head.
Delhi police did not respond to requests for comment for this story. On Tuesday evening, the force issued a statement saying it was doing its utmost to control the violence and urged people to maintain the peace.
'WE MUST DEFEND OURSELVES'
Like hundreds of thousands of Muslims across the country, Bano had spent weeks protesting against a new citizenship law that gives non-Muslims from three neighboring countries a fast-track to Indian citizenship.
Many Indians say the law is discriminatory and against the spirit of the country's secular constitution. The country's Muslims also fear that a proposed national citizens register could render many of them stateless.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which critics say has pursued a stringent pro-Hindu agenda since being re-elected last year, says the new law is necessary to help persecuted minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
It also denies any bias against India's Muslim population of more than 180 million people.
When protests began in December, clashes were mostly between anti-government demonstrators and police. At least 25 people died that month, mainly in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
This week in Delhi, the violence was largely between Hindus and Muslims, raising fears that large-scale communal bloodshed that has erupted sporadically since India's independence could return.
In northeastern Delhi, the risk is clear. Tempers are running high even as riots subside.
Near a badly burned fuel station in Bhajanpura, a group of Hindu men fumed at the damage suffered by their community.
""If this is what the minority can do, wait till you see what the majority can do when it picks up arms,"" Ajay Choudhary, a yoga instructor, loudly declared to applause and cheers, as he pointed to burned buildings.
India is 80 percent Hindu, with Muslims making up 14 percent of the 1.3 billion population.
""We had to do something to defend ourselves. They were lusting for blood,"" said Ashish, a 21-year-old Hindu student who only gave his first name.
LACK OF TRUST
Faith in the ability of politicians and police to contain the unrest is wearing thin among local residents.
""This is all the work of politicians who don't want the communities to stay together,"" said Bano, injuries visible on her head, arms and legs.
During recent local elections in Delhi, some members of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) described the protesters, most of them Muslims, as ""traitors"".
Junior finance minister Anurag Thakur encouraged a crowd to chant ""shoot the traitors"" during a rally.
Amit Shah, India's home minister and Modi's right-hand man, criticized the remarks in an interview several weeks after his BJP party was routed in the New Delhi polls.
""These statements shouldn't have been made. The party has distanced itself from such comments,"" Shah said in an interview earlier in February.
On Thursday, another BJP leader, India's Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar, said it was opposition parties that had fanned the violence during months of protests against the citizenship law.
""This is not about the violence that's gone on for two days. For two months, people have been provoked,"" he said.
Some local residents pointed the finger at the police for failing to do enough to protect them from attack. The Delhi force is controlled by Shah's Home Ministry.
Kalam Ahmed Khan, a Muslim in Chand Bagh, said police should have done more to prevent the clashes this week.

""All this has happened under the police's nose,"" he said.

""I could fall to my death.""
But the 41-year old member of the seven-generation family of daredevils, The Flying Wallendas, is taking it in stride.
""It is just the reality of what I do,"" he told Reuters on Thursday, ahead of his live, televised walk 1800 feet (548 meters) across the Masaya volcano with churning lava below.
According to Dick Clark Productions, it will be the highest and longest walk he has ever attempted.
""I will tell you that my first step I take will be a step of faith,"" he said. ""It's not as though I'm fearless. It is more about me overcoming that fear.""  
Wallenda, who has made successful walks across Niagara Falls and above Times Square (NYSE:SQ), said he has been training with an oxygen depravation mask to mirror the conditions above the volcano. 
He will be wearing goggles, a mask and possibly even oxygen tanks for the walk. His shoes have been designed with thicker soles to help cut possible heat coming from the volcano, and the cable will feel like a bar, the high wire artist said.
""I'll be dealing with the winds of the Grand Canyon, potentially. I'll be dealing with the gases that are so thick that you can potentially not be able to see 10 feet in front of me,"" he said.
""Everything that has been thrown at me here adds to my stress levels.""
Wallenda said the idea came to him after flying over an active volcano on the way to Mexico City. 
Masaya is one of six major active volcanoes in Nicaragua, and has erupted at least 18 times since 1520, including major eruptions in 1772 and 1820.
The volcano is located about 14 miles (23 kilometers) from the Central American country's capital, Managua, and is 2,093 feet (638 meters) in elevation.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 06:24PM ET</span>",How the Democratic nominating battle could end in a messy 'brokered convention',"By Joseph Ax
(Reuters) - Seemingly every four years, political pundits speculate about a ""brokered"" U.S. presidential convention - only to see a nominee selected with little or no drama. But that may not be the case in 2020.
With the field of Democratic contenders deeply fragmented ahead of the all-important Super Tuesday contests in 14 states on March 3, chances are growing that no contender will amass the majority of delegates needed to clinch the nomination outright.
PredictIt, one of the most active markets taking bets on U.S. politics, on Thursday implied a better-than-even chance that neither Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the national-front-runner, nor his rivals will secure the minimum 1,991 delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot at this July's convention in Milwaukee.
Failure to secure a first-ballot win could result in a ""brokered convention,"" in which candidates and party leaders engage in horse trading to try to gain a majority of delegates on subsequent ballots.
No Republican or Democratic convention has gone beyond a single ballot since 1952.
But the rise of Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has prompted Democratic Party leaders to consider whether his nomination would do more damage than a chaotic battle at July's convention in Milwaukee.
Here's how the nominating process works – and why it could evolve into a messy contest.
 
What's the ""simple"" way of capturing the nomination?
The easiest way to secure the nomination at the convention is to earn a majority of votes on the first ballot from the thousands of ""pledged delegates"" who will be awarded through the primary process.
Unlike Republicans, who award delegates in some states on a winner-take-all basis, all Democratic delegates are allocated proportionately. Generally speaking, the higher a candidate's support, the more delegates collected, as long as he or she gets at least 15 percent of the vote.
The proportional system makes it more difficult for any one candidate in a crowded field to capture an outright majority of delegates.
Take New Hampshire's primary earlier this month. Sanders narrowly defeated former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg in the popular vote, 25.7% to 24.4%, while Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota finished with 19.8%. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joe Biden gained 9.2% and 8.4%, respectively.
Because Warren and Biden failed to hit 15% statewide or in either of the state's two congressional districts, they earned no delegates.
The top three divided up the 24 available pledged delegates, with Sanders and Buttigieg getting nine each – 37.5% percent, significantly higher than their popular vote percentage – and Klobuchar receiving six.
 
What happens if no candidate has a majority?
The convention's first ballot will include only the nearly 4,000 pledged delegates.
If no candidate gets a majority, the convention would hold a second ballot, which would expand to include nearly 800 so-called ""superdelegates"" – Democratic U.S. representatives and senators, Democratic governors, Democratic National Committee (DNC) members and important party figures such as former presidents.
In 2016, when superdelegates overwhelmingly endorsed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton, Sanders supporters argued the system was unfair since those superdelegates were allowed to vote on the first ballot.
As a result, the DNC instituted new rules for this year, backed by Sanders, that prevent superdelegates from participating in the initial vote.
After each ballot, delegates are free to switch to other candidates, raising the likelihood that different contenders would seek to horse-trade their way to a majority. The party would hold as many ballots as needed to reach a majority of the nearly 4,800 pledged delegates and superdelegates.
Notably, the delegates can nominate anyone, even individuals who did not campaign for president - such as former first lady Michelle Obama, just to pick one extremely unlikely scenario.
Some Democrats have warned a brokered convention could tear the party apart, particularly if by July Sanders has the largest number of delegates but does not get the nomination.
 
Is a brokered convention inevitable if no one secures a majority?
Not necessarily. Pledged delegates are technically free to vote for any candidate on the first ballot, and candidates who either drop out or have little hope might encourage their supporters to back another contender.
If, for instance, both Sanders and Biden had around 40% of the delegates, lower-tier candidates might decide to ask their delegates to vote for one or the other weeks before the convention.
How is this all playing out on the campaign trail?
Sanders has said the candidate with the most delegates should get the nomination, since that best reflects the will of the people.
But as rival Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed out during a CNN town hall on Wednesday, Sanders himself said the opposite in 2016, when Clinton held a majority of pledged delegates. At the time, he argued superdelegate support could still clinch the party's nod for him at the convention.
Warren said she would fight until the convention even if she trails in delegates.
""Bernie had a big hand in writing these rules,"" she said. ""I didn't write them.""

HAVANA (Reuters) - Communist-run Cuba will deliver its verdict in a closely watched case against Jose Daniel Ferrer, one of the country's leading dissidents, on March 12, his wife told Reuters on Thursday, the day after his trial.
Ferrer, 49, was arrested nearly five months ago on charges of abducting a man and causing him serious injuries, charges he denies and that his supporters say are aimed at silencing a vocal and internationally known government critic.
Ferrer is the leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), one of the country’s largest and most active opposition groups.
The case has earned Cuba much criticism and global rights organizations, the European Parliament and the U.S. government have called for Ferrer’s release.
The European Union’s foreign service, which has been slow to criticize Cuba of late as it normalizes relations, said on Thursday it had received information suggesting Ferrer was being prosecuted for his views rather than assault, and that his ""constitutional rights to due process"" had been disregarded.
""We expect Cuba to review, as a matter of urgency, all cases of incarceration related to the exercise of fundamental rights, and to release all those concerned,"" the European External Action Service said in an unusual statement. It added that the EU delegation in Cuba had not been granted its request to attend the trial.
The trial took place in Ferrer's hometown, Santiago de Cuba, around 500 miles east of Havana, his wife Nelva Ortega said by telephone. It lasted more than 12 hours and was not open to foreign media.
State prosecutors reiterated their call for a 9-year prison sentence, Ortega said. If Ferrer is found guilty, his family will appeal, she added.
Cuban authorities, who have denounced Ferrer as a U.S.-backed counterrevolutionary, have confirmed he is in jail and state-run media started granting the case unusual coverage as it sparked international controversy.
They have not commented on the trial, except for a tweet by the justice ministry late on Wednesday that said Ferrer would have a ""just trial"" but calling him a ""common criminal, not a political prisoner.""
Government critics said the tweet showed there was no due process in Cuba and that the court already considered Ferrer guilty before deliberating his case. The ministry later deleted the tweet.
Ferrer was one of 75 dissidents arrested in 2003 during a nationwide crackdown known as the Black Spring. He was released on parole in 2011 and soon after formed UNPACU."

The legislation would aim to restore $3.8 billion back to the Pentagon's weapons procurement and National Guard budgets.
""They robbed the bank and now they are running away with the money,"" Democratic Representative Adam Smith, who chairs the committee, told reporters.
The Trump administration has vowed to build at least 400 miles (640 km) of wall along the border by November 2020. In his 2016 election campaign, Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall. The Mexican government has consistently refused to do so.
The bill is being discussed with the staff of top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, Representative Mac Thornberry, Smith said. Smith hoped to get it to the House floor as soon as possible. 
The legislation would target the fiscal 2021 budget reprogramming that took money from the National Guard, and weapons procurement including the  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) F-35 fighter jet program, Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft,  Boeing Co  (N:BA) P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, and shipbuilding.

While it might be approved in the House, the bill looks unlikely to be passed in the Senate, controlled by Trump's Republicans.

GENEVA/DUBAI (Reuters) - No country should make the ""fatal mistake"" of assuming it will be spared the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said on Thursday, as governments from Iran to Australia raced to contain the epidemic's rapid global spread.
With new infections reported around the world now surpassing those in mainland China, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said even rich nations should prepare for surprises.
""No country should assume it won't get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally,"" Tedros said, pointing to Italy, where authorities said three more people had died, bringing the toll from Europe's worst outbreak of the illness to 17. Confirmed cases there rose to 650. 
In addition to stockpiling medical supplies, governments ordered schools shut and canceled big gatherings, including sports events, to try to halt spread of the flu-like disease that emerged in China more than two months ago from an illegal wildlife market. 
It is on the decline in China itself after an aggressive containment campaign, but rising elsewhere.
There is particular concern over a case in Japan in which a woman tested positive for the virus for a second time. Second positive tests have also been reported in China and could imply contracting the disease does not confer immunity. Scientists warned that much remains unknown about the virus. 
The head of the WHO's emergency program, Dr. Mike Ryan, said discussions were being held with organizers about the fate of the 2020 Olympics, scheduled for July in Tokyo, although no decision was expected soon.
Their cancellation or relocation would be a massive blow for Japan, which said it was closing its entire school system for the next month in a bid to prevent spread of the virus.
The new coronavirus had mainly battered China, causing nearly 80,000 infections and more than 2,700 deaths, according to WHO figures. It has spread to another 44 countries, where around 3,500 cases and 54 deaths have been reported. 
Though the outbreak meets the definition of a pandemic - widespread contagion across a large region - the WHO has so far held back from using the term. 
""This virus has pandemic potential,"" Tedros told reporters in Geneva. 
He said Iran, Italy and South Korea were at a ""decisive point,"" still short of sustained community transmission.

Global equity markets have dropped for six straight days, wiping out more than $3.6 trillion in value. (MIWD00000PUS) 
Jeremy Farrar, a specialist in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, urged finance institutions to commit an initial $10 billion funds to fighting the virus.
""What we are really missing is tangible, high-level funding and support from global financial institutions,"" he said in a statement. ""The possible impact of this coronavirus is far beyond a health emergency - it's a global crisis with potential to reach the scale of the global financial crisis of 2008."" 
Traders are betting the U.S. Federal Reserve will move aggressively to cut borrowing costs in coming months in response to the effects of the coronavirus on the economy.
Politicians are also scrambling to respond.
In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison ordered hospitals to ensure sufficient medical and protective supplies and staff, while President Donald Trump's administration was considering invoking special powers to rapidly expand U.S. production of protective masks and clothing, two officials said. [nL2N2AR1LL]
President Emmanuel Macron attempted to rally the nation as France's number of reported cases doubled.
""We have a crisis before us. An epidemic is on its way,"" Macron said.
Germany, too, has warned of an impending epidemic. And Greece, a gateway for refugees from the Middle East and beyond, announced tighter border controls.
There is no cure for the coronavirus, which can lead to pneumonia, and a vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop.
MISINFORMATION 'EPIDEMIC'
Iran, urging people to avoid unnecessary travel, extended closures of cinemas, cultural events and conferences for another week and called off Friday prayers in some cities.
The WHO's Ryan said Iran's outbreak may be worse than yet realized. It has suffered the highest death toll outside China, with 26 dead and 245 infected, including some senior officials. The high rate of deaths compared to other countries suggests there are many cases that have yet to be detected, experts say. 
Italy, desperate to stave off a probable recession, warned that an ""epidemic of misleading information"" could do worse harm than the virus itself.
The coronavirus has played havoc with global aviation and tourism as airlines cancel flights, countries ban visitors from hot spots and nervous passengers put off travel.
Chinese authorities said the number of new deaths there stood at 29, its lowest daily tally since Jan. 28. There were 433 new cases in mainland China over the previous day, compared to 586 in nations and territories elsewhere.

BALTIMORE (Reuters) - Former Baltimore mayor Catherine Pugh was sentenced on Thursday to three years in federal prison for fraud and tax evasion schemes involving bogus sales of her children's book series.
U.S. District Judge Deborah Chasanow ordered Pugh, who served for three years as mayor of Maryland's largest city, to surrender no later than April 13.
""This could not have come at a worse time for the city,"" the judge said in an apparent reference to Baltimore's struggle to overcome its dark history of government kickbacks, police corruption and steep murder rate.
""It is astounding. This was not a tiny mistake; this became a very large fraud,"" the judge said in an emotion-choked voice.
Pugh, who turns 70 next week, pleaded guilty in November to fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy. She faced a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison.
She admitted fraudulent sales of her series of self-published ""Healthy Holly"" children's books, pulling in roughly $650,000 while failing to deliver the goods to public schools. She used the ill-gotten gains to buy and renovate a second home in Baltimore, prosecutors said.
Before she was sentenced, Pugh spoke for about 10 minutes, tears running down her face as she stood before the judge.
""No one is more disappointed than me,"" said Pugh, who is divorced and has no children.
""I do not want to take my city through any more shame as a result of my actions,” said Pugh, whose brothers were among family members sitting in the courtroom.
The three-year sentence was less than the 57 months (4 years, 9 months) behind bars that was requested by Assistant U.S. Attorney Leo Wise, who said Pugh's schemes were ""shocking"" and akin to a ""mobster movie.""
Pugh's lawyer, Steve Silverman, had asked for a sentence of one year and one day. He praised her work on behalf of Baltimore, noting she had launched a fashion-design high school for girls and removed Confederate statues displayed in the city."

The electoral commission has repeatedly confirmed Embalo as the winner of the Dec. 29 run-off despite complaints by the Supreme Court that the commission has not respected its orders to conduct a full audit of the vote.
Runner-up Domingos Simoes Pereira, whose PAIGC party holds the most seats in parliament, filed a fresh complaint on Wednesday, asking the court to order a re-vote because of what he says were widespread irregularities.
It is not clear when the court will rule.
The bitterly disputed result suggests that, whatever the final outcome, the election is unlikely to end the institutional chaos of the past five years, during which President Jose Mario Vaz cycled through seven different prime ministers while in a protracted dispute with the PAIGC.
Vaz, who was eliminated in the election's first round in November, attended Thursday's swearing-in at a hotel reception hall in the capital, Bissau.
So did high-ranking officials from the military, which has launched nine coups or attempted coups since independence from Portugal in 1974.
But many senior dignitaries, including the parliament speaker, Supreme Court judges and most foreign diplomats in Bissau, stayed away. While many foreign governments congratulated Embalo when he was first declared the winner, they have mostly kept silent about the subsequent legal wrangling.
In his inaugural speech, Embalo did not mention the electoral dispute as he vowed to tackle widespread poverty in a country dependent on a main export, cashew nuts, for which prices are volatile.
""The record of 46 years of independence is characterized by the total collapse of the dreams of our ancestors,"" he said, wearing a sash with the red, yellow and green of the national flag.
The current generation of leaders ""will work to have a better health and education system and to pull the country from the slump in which it is mired"", Embalo added.
Pereira, meanwhile, continued to decry on Twitter what he says is an electoral coup and hailed support he has received from party allies in the government and parliament.
""The national assembly, prime minister, government, political parties and legalists are united to prevent the anti-democratic threat (from) the competing candidate's group,"" he said."

BOGOTA (Reuters) - A United Nations report critical of Colombia's efforts to protect human rights advocates failed to recognize advances in that area and social investment in regions suffering violence, President Ivan Duque said on Thursday.
The Wednesday report, in which the U.N. decried a nearly 50% increase in killings of women human rights defenders in 2019 and asked the government to continue protection efforts, interferes in domestic issues, Duque added.
Duque has faced frequent criticism from the international community, non-governmental organizations and human rights activists for not doing enough to stop the killings of so-called ""social leaders"".
The U.N. report also highlighted what it called scant progress in rural reforms in areas suffering violence tied to the country's long-running armed conflict. It recommended the government put the police under the control of the Interior Ministry instead of the Defense Ministry.
""It worries me that there are inaccuracies,"" Duque told journalists. ""I think it is also an intrusion on the sovereignty of a country when it says the police should pass to the Interior Ministry - that is a debate that is the business of Colombian authorities.""
There cannot be biases on the part of the U.N., Duque said, adding Colombia will protest the report at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, which published the report, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on Thursday signed into law new rules that increase government oversight of non-profit groups operating in the Central American country, despite international pressure that he veto the bill.
Congress passed the bill on Feb. 12 with the support of ruling party and other conservative lawmakers who argue that foreign-backed non-governmental organizations (NGOs) violate national sovereignty.
Michael Kozak, a senior official in the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, last month described the bill as putting ""onerous"" requirements on NGOs in Guatemala, saying such groups play key roles in functioning democracies.
He called on Guatemala to revise the bill in line with international standards, a sentiment echoed by the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, which urged Giammattei in a letter to veto the bill.
The letter likened the legislation to rules passed in Russia and Venezuela, warning it could limit freedom of assembly and efforts to improve democratic governance, potentially contributing to increased migration to the United States.
The law requires NGOs to register, report donations and allow their accounts to be inspected. Under the rules, several government bodies have powers to cancel the licenses of the groups if they determine their activities ""alter public order.""
Giammattei said he would not bow to foreign pressure.
""This is a sovereign country, and we hope that friendly nations respect our decisions,"" Giammattei told reporters at a signing ceremony at the presidential palace.
He said he was not opposed to civil society groups, and named non-profits working with disabled children as examples to follow. But he said, other groups, including those that opposed the new law, were misusing funds.
Governments around the world, including Turkey and India, in recent years have made regulations more burdensome for civil society groups. In 2019, rights group Amnesty International released a report warning of a ""global assault"" on NGOs.
In Guatemala, civil society has often been at odds with governments, the army and business groups by seeking justice for victims of a 36-year-long civil war, as well as supporting anti-corruption efforts and peasant farmer and land-rights activists."

(Reuters) - Amid heavy fighting in northwest Syria between government forces backed by Russia and Syrian rebels supported by Turkey, the U.N. Security Council heard a plea on Thursday from women caught in the middle: ""All we are asking, is for the misery to stop, for the killing to stop. We want the right to live.""
The message was shared by deputy U.N. aid chief Ursula Mueller, who spoke via videolink to 14 Syrian women in Idlib and northern Aleppo last week.
""What is happening in northwest Syria, they said, is beyond imagination. It is not humanly tolerable. They told me of children so traumatized they no longer speak,"" Mueller said.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, supported by Russian air power, have been fighting to retake the last large, rebel-held region in Syria after nine years of war. Turkey has sent thousands of troops and heavy military hardware into Idlib region in an unprecedented incursion to back the rebels.
Nearly a million Syrians have fled over the last three months, the biggest exodus of the conflict. A crackdown by Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 led to civil war.
Mueller and Henrietta Fore, executive director of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, told the Security Council that hospitals, schools and camps for displaced families had been hit in recent fighting.
""We've heard and read reports of children freezing to death,"" Fore said. ""When wood runs out, families burn whatever they can find — plastic bags, garbage, discarded furniture — just to provide a flicker of heat against the cold, or a simple fire to cook whatever food they can find.""
Defending Moscow's role in the conflict, Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia questioned why the United Nations and aid groups weren't more prepared to deal with millions of displaced people in Idlib during the winter.
""The humanitarian workers have plenty of resources so why hasn't this problem been resolved?"" he asked.
Britain's deputy U.N. Ambassador Jonathan Allen responded: ""The answer is because they're being bombed, they're being shelled, they're being attacked. It is extremely difficult indeed to provide assistance to people in those circumstances.""
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, said that to end the humanitarian crisis in northwest Syria all efforts must be concentrated on establishing a durable and verifiable ceasefire.
""This will require Russia to ground its planes at once and tell the regime to pull back its forces,"" she told the council.
However, Nebenzia said: ""The only long-term solution to the problem of Idlib and ... of Syria as a whole is a final and irreversible expulsion from the country of all terrorists. And please don't tell us we're exaggerating the problem.""
Both Mueller and Fore appealed for action from the council, which has long been divided on how to deal with Syria. Russia had vetoed 14 draft resolutions during the war.
""Millions of Syrian children are crying tonight - from hunger and cold, from wounds and pain, from fear, loss and heartbreak,"" Fore said."
285,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 02:14PM ET</span>",President Erdogan's options narrow as Russia presses Syrian crisis to Turkey's doorstep,"By Jonathan Spicer and Khalil Ashawi
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - With nearly one million displaced Syrians massing near the Turkish border in the face of a Syrian government military offensive, President Tayyip Erdogan’s options are narrowing. 
He feels blindsided by Russia’s push into Syria’s Idlib region and the risk of full-blown conflict is growing, but Turkey's Erdogan remains hopeful a deal with Moscow may offer a way out of the crisis, according to Turkish government officials and other sources.
Erdogan has repeatedly warned that Turkey, which backs rebels in Syria’s northwest province, would push Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s troops away from territory taken in the recent months if they didn’t pull back by the end of February. 
But as Saturday’s deadline has drawn closer, the Russia-backed Syrian offensive has continued to gain ground and a third round of talks between Ankara and Moscow this week were not expected to quickly break the deadlock.
Turkish government and Syrian opposition military officials, diplomats and analysts said while a full-scale Turkish-backed military operation is still a possibility, depending on how hard Russia bargains, Erdogan is more likely at this late stage to agree a deal with Moscow that has him withdraw some of Turkey’s military presence in exchange for a role in deciding Syria’s future. They added that Erdogan has been taken aback by what Turkey views as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s uncompromising stance in the field and in discussions.
A Turkish official told Reuters: “Turkey and Russia can still reach a compromise."" But, ""if there is no agreement and attacks on Turkish soldiers continue, the Idlib offensive will begin,” referring to a direct Turkish military effort to retake territory.
Erdogan’s office did not respond to a request for comment. He and aides have publicly said they want to solve the problem with Russia, but that Turkey’s resolve should not be tested and it will not abandon observation posts in Idlib, some of which have been surrounded by Syrian forces.
Erdogan's decision will help define one of the worst humanitarian disasters so far this century, in which an estimated 900,000 Syrians – about half of whom are children – have been uprooted as they have fled the bombing of their towns and villages in recent months. In December, Moscow and Damascus, reinforced by Iran-backed fighters, launched the operation into the last big territory in northwest Syria held by opposition forces as they seek to end on Assad’s terms nine years of a bloody proxy that has resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of Syrians. 
As Russian-backed Syrian government forces have pushed northwest, displaced Syrians have amassed along Turkey’s closed southern border sleeping in tents or outside, with at least several children having died in freezing weather in recent months. ""The bombing comes at us from everywhere... We no longer have any guarantor, not Turkey nor anyone else,"" said Mohamad Atouf, 31, sheltering with his wife and four children in an empty hut near the border town of Azaz.
Erdogan faces the competing demands of the welfare of the displaced Syrians and his support at home, where there is little appetite for adding to the 3.7 million Syrian refugees already in Turkey.
Turkey, which has sent thousands of troops and equipment into the region to support the rebels, has seen about 20 troops killed so far in February. Hundreds more troops stationed in the observation posts have been surrounded by Syrian government forces that have stormed across Idlib under cover of unrelenting Russian air strikes.
Fighting has raged in recent days and late Thursday Russian state television said Turkish military specialists targeted Russian planes with shoulder-fired missiles. Ankara didn't immediately publicly respond to the claim.
Faced with Russian air supremacy in Idlib, Erdogan’s most likely action would be striking a ceasefire deal with Putin in which the Turkish leader walks back repeated threats of an offensive but saves face with a role in deciding Syria's future and in managing the migrant crisis, according to the government officials, diplomats and analysts.
Turkey, which opposes Assad and has supported some of the rebel fighters trying to topple him, hopes to re-impose the map of a 2018 Sochi agreement that called for a demilitarization zone around the Idlib region, but analysts said it would settle for a smaller zone of influence containing the displaced Syrians.
Syrian government forces have now taken about half of Idlib province and Assad has vowed to take back “every inch” of Syria. 
Turkey remains hopeful of a deal. Erdogan had wanted Russian, German and French counterparts to meet on March 5 to discuss Idlib, but on Thursday the Kremlin said Putin had no plans for a meeting on that date. Germany and France have condemned the humanitarian crisis and urged an end to the conflict.  
A separate Turkish official said a final resolution was unlikely until March 6, when leaders have floated but not confirmed a Turkey-Russia-Iran summit on Idlib.
The Kremlin did not immediately comment on prospects of a ceasefire. Vladimir Frolov, a former senior Russian diplomat, said Russia’s position is full control of Syria by Assad with potentially a narrow strip in Idlib along the Turkish border controlled in part by Erdogan and policed by Russia. Though Turkey is unlikely to accept that, said analysts, diplomats and officials in Ankara.
""Turkey has no good options from now on,"" said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat and currently chairman of the Centre for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies, an Istanbul-based think tank. “This is why if there isn’t a ceasefire soon, Turkey will fight.""
On Wednesday, Erdogan restated his plans to push Syrian government forces away from its military observation posts in northwest Syria's Idlib region by end-February. 
Rebels backed by Turkey said on Thursday they recaptured the strategic town on Saraqeb.
While disputed by some, taking Saraqeb marks the first major reversal by Turkey-backed Syrian rebels and allowed them to re-gain a portion of the main north-south highway linking Syria’s main cities. 
But Assad's forces have continued to make advances elsewhere in the province in recent weeks, taking numerous other villages and towns in the south of Idlib province.
A Turkish offensive that would face Russia’s air dominance would pose huge risks for Turkey. While its military is the second largest in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Turkey would likely rely on artillery units near the border because it lacks U.S.-made surface-to-air defenses after Ankara opted last year to buy Russian-made S-400s. 

NATO members could supply Turkey with equipment and intelligence but not intervene on Syrian soil, diplomats and Turkish officials said. NATO did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Widespread government ""ghost jobs"" will likely be among the first targets of Guatemala's new anti-corruption tsar, the official said on Thursday, although the commission he heads has more limited scope than its powerful U.N.-backed predecessor.
The commission under President Alejandro Giammattei will announce next week its first areas of investigation, and no-show or ghost jobs suspected to exist in government departments are among the first targets, the official said in an interview.
Days after taking office in January, Giammattei said the government had detected 37,000 positions where nobody appeared to show up for work. He said the ghost jobs were in the interior ministry, finance ministry, tax office and a social-work agency under the presidency.
The probes launched by the Presidential Commission Against Corruption will be limited to government officials, its head Oscar Davila told Reuters. If private sector individuals or other citizens are implicated, the commission will hand over the investigation to public prosecutors.
That contrasts with the U.N.-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which left the country last year after investigations which touched some of the country's most powerful business families as well as toppling a sitting president.
""The presidential commission is totally different from CICIG,"" Davila said, describing the new body as an internal affairs unit of the government.
However, he said the new commission could carry out raids on any office under the executive branch without warning, giving it the power to act more swiftly than other investigative units.
Critics of CICIG said it overreached its mandate, leading to a backlash from the government of former President Jimmy Morales and the country's elites.
However, without the same international backing, its replacement may struggle to combat high-level graft.
""The moment CICIG went, the country was left without any open paths to attack the issue,"" Davila said, noting that other corruption investigative units had also been weakened.
""The arrival of the presidential commission is encouraging for the public,"" he said, adding that he would resign from the position if he ever felt his work was being obstructed."
287,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 01:43PM ET</span>","Colombia coca eradication hampered by landmines and protests, police say","TUMACO, Colombia (Reuters) - Landmines and protests promoted by armed groups involved in drug trafficking are major obstacles to the eradication of coca, the base ingredient in cocaine, according to a Colombian anti-narcotic police chief.
The Andean country, long a major supplier of cocaine, is looking to eradicate 130,000 hectares (320,000 acres) of coca this year. It will likely return to the use of aerial fumigation using the herbicide glyphosate once the government meets safety conditions set by the Constitutional Court.
The target is some 30% higher than last year, when police and civilian eradicators ripped up 100,000 hectares, largely using manual techniques after the aerial spraying of glyphosate was suspended in 2015 amid concerns that it was harmful to health and the environment.
""The (effort to meet the) target faces various challenges daily. One is social protests which sometimes hinder the progress of operations,"" Colonel Jesus Enrique Quintero, the head of Colombia's police anti-narcotics spraying unit, told Reuters during an eradication operation in the Pacific region of Tumaco on Wednesday.
Colombian authorities have said protests by farmers against coca eradication are encouraged by armed groups, who often force poor rural populations to cultivate the plant.
""There's also the issue of anti-personnel mines, the use of explosives to cause harm,"" Quintero said. Landmines are often placed around coca-growing areas to deter eradication efforts.
Bad weather and difficult terrain were also challenges, added Quintero.
Last year snipers from armed groups killed at least nine people participating in eradication work, while another 50 were injured, mostly by landmines, according to Defense Ministry figures.

National Liberation Army rebels, dissidents from the former FARC guerrillas who reject a 2016 peace deal, and crime gangs all participate in the drug trade in Colombia.

European states which are members of the open-border Schengen area have stepped up planning over measures to contain the coronavirus after the epidemic flared in the continent last week from hotspots in northern Italy, following its first emergence in China in December.
So far, EU and Schengen states have no intention to introduce border checks to tackle the epidemic, a spokeswoman for the EU Commission told reporters.
At a meeting on Wednesday, EU experts agreed instead that sending people potentially infected with the virus back at borders would help spread the disease, an EU official said, adding that this position would be reviewed weekly.
""Refusal of entry is not considered an appropriate preventive or remedial measure as the virus would spread further,"" the official said, reporting the results of the meeting. Potential patients could keep moving around in their own countries without being properly treated.
The official added that quarantine measures for those with symptoms were considered much more effective. At EU external borders, experts advised instead to have ""systematic"" checks for those arriving, the official said.
Decisions on imposing temporary border checks are made by national authorities and cannot be vetoed by the EU Commission, the EU executive arm.
But states are obliged to notify new measures to Brussels.
The open-border European area risked imploding during the 2015 migration crisis as many states imposed border checks, crippling the free movement of people.
Six states still have border checks in place at certain borders until May to prevent terrorist risks and irregular migrant movements. They are Germany, France, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway.
These temporary border checks will expire in May.
States could impose new checks on health grounds if they wished so, the official said, in what would an unprecedented move, as border controls have at present never been introduced because of epidemics."

The theme park, called ""Ostrov Mechty"" - or Dream Island - is built in the shape of a toy castle that spreads across 30 hectares in an industrial neighborhood in southern Moscow and is filled with rides, attractions and restaurants. 
Joined by Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, Putin strolled through the park inspecting a scale model of the facility and stopping to take pictures with a group of disadvantaged children brought in for his visit.
Russia has strived in recent years to build bigger and better facilities than the West to show it remains a force to be reckoned with, and has prided itself on major construction and infrastructure projects.
Dream Island is no exception. 
Municipal authorities say it is the largest indoor theme park of its kind in Europe and that its main glass dome is several times larger than the dome at the Galeries Lafayette in Paris and more than double the size of one atop the German Reichstag in Berlin.
The new facility has drawn criticism from some quarters however for its extravagance and unusual design and popular blogger Ilya Varlamov ranked it seventh on his list of Russia's top 100 ugliest buildings. 
Russia remains under Western sanctions over its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and has struggled to find meaningful economic growth. But it has pressed ahead with big infrastructure projects regardless. 

In 2014 it opened what it said was the largest shopping mall in Europe, and Putin last year opened a rail route linking Russia's two biggest cities to Crimea over a giant new bridge.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada will no longer provide security for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Canadian government said on Thursday, once the couple are no longer working members of the British royal family in the coming weeks.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have been assisting London's Metropolitan Police with security for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ""intermittently"" since November, when the couple began a six-week holiday in Canada, according to a statement from the federal Office of the Minister of Public Safety.
But once Harry and Meghan are no longer considered senior members of the British royal family, they will no longer receive the publicly-funded security that is estimated to cost into the millions of dollars.
The couple stunned the royal family in early January with a surprise announcement that they would be stepping down from their roles as senior royals, in order to gain freedom from the intense media scrutiny that has followed them for several years.
They announced their intention to spend more time in Canada, which could put part of the responsibility of their security onto the Canadian government.
""As the Duke and Duchess are currently recognized as Internationally Protected Persons, Canada has an obligation to provide security assistance on an as-needed basis,"" the government statement said.
""The assistance will cease in the coming weeks, in keeping with their change in status."""

ABUJA (Reuters) - Islamist militant groups in Nigeria have begun targeting Christians in an attempt to provoke a religious war, the information minister said on Thursday.
Islamist insurgents in Nigeria have killed around 35,000 people and displaced at least two million in the past decade, driven first by Boko Haram and more recently by its offshoot, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP).
Information Minister Lai Mohammed said jihadist groups in the northeast of the country have now adopted a ""deliberate policy of attacking Christians.""
""They have started targeting Christians and Christian villages for a specific reason, which is to trigger a religious war and throw the nation into chaos,"" he told reporters.
Nigeria's 200 million inhabitants are roughly split between Islam and Christianity.
Mohammed cited a number of flashpoints. In December, ISWAP beheaded 10 Christian men, and shot dead an 11th. And in January, Boko Haram executed the chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN). He also pointed to raids on Christian villages in the north.
Mohammed said Nigeria was serious about tackling violent extremism and committed to protecting Christians and Muslims.
""We want to therefore appeal to our religious leaders ... not to fall for this desperate move by the insurgents, not to allow them to divide us as a people and weaken our resolve,"" he said.
Kwamkur Samuel, a spokesman for CAN, said Mohammed was engaging in political rhetoric.
""Boko Haram and ISWAP have always been killing Christians and even liberal Muslims,"" he said. ""The problem is government management of the situation. No decisive actions have been taken to stop the killings."""

The website advertises for ""talented and experienced communications and digital professionals"", saying it wants to attract applicants from all walks of life and different parts of the country.
Special advisers, often referred to simply as SpAds, work closely with ministers and government officials. They are not required to be politically impartial like most other government employees and their ability to influence policy often leads to questions from opponents about how and why they were appointed.
The new website 'spadjobs.uk' aims to address this criticism by making the process open to all. Applicants will be filtered by private strategic advisory firm Hanbury Strategy, although final hiring decision will still rest with Johnson's office.
""Successful applicants will go through a rigorous process of written exercises, telephone interviews and a selection panel,"" the website says.
It not recruiting policy advisers, only those who will handle communications and digital briefs.
One of Johnson's most senior advisers, Dominic Cummings, launched a different private recruitment drive last month, saying he wanted to hire “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to advise the government on policy.
However that approach quickly drew criticism after a ""superforecaster"" hired as part of Cumming's plan resigned following criticism of his past comments on the benefits of eugenics and forced contraception."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia successfully test-launched its Tsirkon (Zircon) hypersonic cruise missile from a military vessel for the first time early last month, the TASS news agency said on Thursday, citing two military sources.
President Vladimir Putin talked up hypersonic missiles in a March 2018 speech, saying they were part of a new generation of Russian weapons that could hit almost any point in the world and evade a U.S.-built missile shield.
State television presenter Dmitry Kiselyov said in February 2019 that the Tsirkon missile could hit targets in the United States in less than five minutes if launched from submarines.
""In accordance with the Tsirkon's state testing program, in early January this year, the Admiral Gorshkov (ship) carried out the test launch of this missile from the Barents Sea to a ground target in one of the military ranges in the northern Urals,"" one source told TASS.
The next stage in the Tsirkon's development after tests from the Admiral Gorshkov were complete would be a test launch from a nuclear submarine, the source said.
The successful launch of the missile, whose January flight exceeded 500 kilometers (310 miles) according to another source, increased Russia's military capabilities.
In August, the United States pulled out of a landmark strategic arms accord, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), adding to tensions between the two former Cold War adversaries, but giving both countries the opportunity to expand their nuclear arsenals with increased impunity.
Putin oversaw the launch of a different hypersonic missile, the Kinzhal (Dagger), which is air-launched, from a naval vessel in the Black Sea near Crimea in January."

Putin, 67, who has dominated Russian politics for more than two decades, has long been the subject of conspiracy theories in Russia - all of them unsubstantiated - that he uses a body double or even a small army of them.
One of the more elaborate theories compares photographs of Putin over the years, claiming to have identified a number of different individuals posing as him. 
But during an interview with TASS news agency aired on Thursday, Putin was shown a list of popular Internet searches purportedly associated with his name, one of which was entitled ""Putin body double evidence"". 
Asked ""Are you real?"" by the interviewer, Putin replied ""Yes"" before going on to deny that he uses a lookalike for public appearances for his own safety.
But he said he had been offered the opportunity.
""I declined these body doubles. This (the offer) was during the most difficult periods of the fight against terrorism,"" Putin said, adding that he was referring to the beginning of the 2000s.
Russia fought a war in the southern Muslim majority region of Chechnya in the early years of Putin's first term and was frequently targeted in attacks by Islamist militant groups.

Putin said in the same interview that he didn't use a mobile phone. He had access to a special official phone, he said, that could connect with any number he wanted.

In the letter published by British newspaper The Guardian, the former ministers rejected Trump's plan for Israelis and Palestinians, which was announced in January and proposes a two-state solution.
Trump's blueprint risks fuelling the conflict at the expense of both Israeli and Palestinian civilians, by annexing large parts of occupied Palestine territory under permanent Israeli military control and is not a legitimate solution, they wrote.
""The plan envisages a formalization of the current reality in the occupied Palestinian territory, in which two peoples are living side by side without equal rights. Such an outcome has characteristics similar to apartheid – a term we don’t use lightly,"" they said.
""It recognizes only one side's claims to Jerusalem and offers no just solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees,"" they added.
Fifty politicians, including former French prime minister and foreign minister Dominique de Villepin, former German foreign minister and vice chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, Britain's former foreign secretary Jack Straw and Ireland's former president Mary Robinson signed the letter.
Other signatories included former ministers or leaders of Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
""Considering the urgency of the situation, we call on Europe to reject the U.S. plan as a basis for negotiations and to take immediate and effective steps to counter the threat of annexation - and thereby preserve the international rules-based order,"" they said.
The Palestinians and Arab League foreign ministers have rejected the plan and the Palestinian Authority has cut all ties with the United States and Israel.

Earlier this week, the Pope also appeared to criticize the plan, warning against ""inequitable solutions"" to the conflict.

Tumso Abdurakhmanov, who fled Russia after an altercation in Chechnya, was taken to hospital on Wednesday after a man broke into his home and attacked him with a hammer, a Chechen rights group said.
It was the third attack on a Kadyrov critic this month, after the murder of Chechen blogger Imran Aliyev in France and an assault on Russian journalist Yelena Milashina in the Chechen capital Grozny.
""An unidentified man broke into Tumso's apartment and tried to kill him with a hammer while he was asleep,"" Vayfond, a Chechen Human Rights Association, said in a statement on its website.
Abdurakhmanov fought back and called the police, and the attacker was detained, the organization said. A Polish police spokesman said the force was working to confirm information about the attack based on media reports.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked on Thursday why critics of the Chechen leader were being repeatedly attacked, said: ""We are not inclined to draw parallels.""
He said Polish police would probably investigate the attack, but ""we don't think it is an important incident for Russia's (news) agenda.""
Abdurakhmanov, a former executive at an electricity company, fled Chechnya after a dispute sparked by a road incident when his car accidentally blocked the motorcade of a Kadyrov family member in 2015, the Kommersant newspaper reported.
Abdurakhmanov says another Chechen official, Deputy Prime Minister Magomed Daudov, threatened to take revenge on him.
Chechen authorities denied that at the time, saying Daudov only wanted Abdurakhmanov to take responsibility for his blogs.
In a YouTube video posted by Vayfond, Abdurakhmanov is seen holding a hammer in front of a camera and questioning a man who is lying on the floor with blood around him.
""Did you come to kill me?"" Abdurakhmanov is heard asking the man in Russian. The man says he was just told to scare the blogger.
The video was later taken down by YouTube because some users complained about blood in the footage, Vayfond said."

The newly created channel, which the U.S. Treasury Department said became fully operational on Thursday as it granted the license, would allow for companies to send food, medicine and other critical supplies to Iran.
Last week, U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook said there was a lot of interest from food and drug companies in using the Swiss Humanitarian Trade Arrangement, which began trial operations last month with shipments of medicine.
The SHTA seeks to ensure that Swiss-based exporters and trading companies in the food, pharmaceutical and medical sectors have a secure payment channel with a Swiss bank, through which payments for their exports to Iran are guaranteed.
Food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies are exempt from the sanctions that Washington reimposed on Tehran after President Donald Trump walked away from a 2015 international deal over Iran's nuclear program.
But the U.S. measures targeting everything from oil sales to shipping and financial activities have deterred several foreign banks from doing business with the Islamic Republic - including humanitarian deals.

France, the former colonial power, has 5,100 troops in Mali and the wider Sahel, but security has been progressively worsening since it intervened in 2013 to stop a jihadist advance to the Malian capital, Bamako.
Critics in the region have increasingly scorned Paris for failing to restore stability and anti-French sentiment has grown as militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State have strengthened their foothold, making large swathes of territory ungovernable and stoking ethnic violence.
That in part pushed President Emmanuel Macron to hold a summit in the French city of Pau last month demanding that the leaders of Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania clarify their positions and reaffirm their support for French troops.
On Wednesday, Mali's ambassador to France, Toumani Djime Diallo, appeared to reopen the debate telling French lawmakers that members of the French foreign legion parachutist regiment were out of control in Bamako.
""At times ... you find them, with tattoos all over their bodies, rendering an image that is not the one we know of the (French) army. It scares, it intrigues"", he said in a public hearing alongside colleagues from Niger, Mauritania, Chad and Burkina Faso.
""Some )of them) do whatever they want in the streets of Bamako, it's not good for the image of France.""
The Armed Forces Ministry said in a statement that no French legionnaires have ever been deployed in Bamako, rather they have been deployed in the border regions linking Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso where there are active operations. It accused the ambassador of spreading ""false accusations"".
""This is unacceptable and indecent when France is firmly committed to fighting terrorist groups which threaten the populations of the Sahel,"" the official said.
""Rather than propagating false accusations, we expect Mali's ambassador to mobilize all his action for the implementation of the decisions of the Pau summit.""
Mali's embassy declined to comment.
France and the five West African states agreed at the Pau meeting to combine their military forces under one command structure and focus on fighting Islamic State-linked militants in the border regions of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso."

TENERIFE, Spain (Reuters) - At first glance, the hotel looks like any other. It bustles with holidaymakers choosing their food and drink from the buffet while others bag sunloungers by the pool. 
Only the protective masks give a glimpse of how unreal life has already become for the 700-plus guests in Tenerife's H10 Costa Adeje Palace Hotel on the third day of its lockdown after four cases of coronavirus were detected there.
""Everything is quite surreal, 95% of the situation remains normal here but we feel encapsulated,"" one of the guests, Christopher Betts, from Leicestershire in central England, told Reuters by telephone as he sat by the pool.
""We kill the time by walking around, reading a bit, sitting by the pool ... Everything is open but the bar,"" he said, praising hotel staff for their hard work.
Regional authorities on the Spanish island said on Wednesday guests would have to stay in the hotel for 14 days to avoid any risk of spreading the disease - their experiences of adjusting to confinement similar to those who spent two weeks in quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruiseliner off Yokohama, near Tokyo.
Just like for some of those passengers, the view from balcony has become their window on the world.
A video from inside the hotel showed guests sunbathing by one of the swimming pools and others serving themselves at a restaurant buffet. Some, but not all, wore protective masks, lowering them while eating.
Others used the hotel exercise bikes as they awaited news of what happens next.
Hugh Elliot, the British Ambassador to Spain, said in a video statement a total of 168 Britons were in the hotel and the embassy had contacted most of them ""to answer questions and respond to concerns"", while working closely with the authorities and hotel management.
""We advise British nationals affected to follow the advice of the local authorities,"" he said. 
The hotel has said in a statement it was cooperating with authorities and did not respond to any requests for comment, including questions on who would ultimately pay for the forced extended vacation.
Most shops nearby shut, as the guests who make up the bulk of their customers were unable to leave the hotel to visit. 
Carlota, a volunteer nurse about to enter the hotel, told Reuters: ""What we are really afraid of is that other people could be infected. Supposedly in healthy people it is not a deadly virus. We should not have any problem"".
The coronavirus can spread via droplets in the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes or breathes out, and these can also contaminate surfaces such as door handles and railings. 
Experts have said guests should minimize contact with one another and remain in their rooms as much as possible. 

Spain's total number of active coronavirus cases rose to 15 on Thursday from 11, with the bulk of them linked to Italy, hit by the worst outbreak of the disease yet seen in Europe, with 528 cases and 14 deaths. The four infected people in the hotel were all Italians.

304,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>",Israeli challenger Gantz plays character card against Netanyahu,"By Dan Williams (NYSE:WMB) and Stephen Farrell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Former military chief Benny Gantz portrays himself as a straight-shooter who will restore simple values to Israel if he wins power in the country's third election in less than a year. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the man Gantz wants to oust in Monday's election, once praised him as ""an officer and a gentleman"" when his government appointed him Chief of Staff of the armed forces eight years ago. 
The tone is very different now. 
Gantz, who leads the centrist Blue and White party, has been attacking Netanyahu's character, mainly over corruption charges facing Israel's longest-serving leader, and the prime minister's right-wing Likud party has branded Gantz a weak leftist. 
Netanyahu's trial is set to begin on March 17, just two weeks after the election. Netanyahu, who at 70 is a decade older than Gantz, denies any wrongdoing, calling the investigation a witch-hunt.
""The man charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust has nothing to sell other than disseminated lies and slung mud,"" Gantz tweeted about Netanyahu a week before the election. ""Israel needs a full-time prime minister.""
But while Blue and White has talked up Gantz's military background, Likud has sought to portray their opponent as soft on Iran and too conciliatory toward the Palestinians.
Gayil Talshir, a Hebrew University political scientist, said Israel still appeared to be split, reflecting the inconclusive outcome of elections in April and September last year in which neither party could form a ruling coalition.
Blue and White led Likud in opinion polls for weeks during this campaign but recent surveys have shown Likud pulling slightly ahead.
""The trial is super-important... the center and left in Israel is going against Netanyahu,"" Talshir said. ""But his (Netanyahu's) own base is rallying around Netanyahu."" 
'PROPER CONDUCT' 
Tall and athletic, with a fondness for folk singing and motorcycle riding, Gantz was a consensus figure for Israelis when chief of the conscript military between 2011 and 2015. 
But what he would do in power is not entirely clear, as he has sent mixed messages.
He casts himself as more diplomatically accommodating than Netanyahu, urging redoubled efforts to restart peace talks.
But while Palestinians may prefer Gantz to Netanyahu, there is little fondness for him after two wars in the Gaza Strip, a self-governing Palestinian enclave, while Gantz was in charge of the Israeli military. About 2,300 Palestinians were killed in the fighting.
He has also publicly embraced U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East plan, which was rejected outright by the Palestinians for what they see as pro-Israel bias.
While Netanyahu holds rallies around the country exhorting his right-wing supporters to turn out, Gantz's party believes some may be persuaded to peel away by a cross-partisan appeal to ""proper conduct.""
""Our polls indicate that a considerable number of Likud supporters are unhappy with the situation and are wavering,"" Yoaz Hendel, one of the party's lawmakers, told Reuters. ""They are part of our focus."" 
Gantz's ""Mr Clean"" image took a knock last week when police announced an investigation into the conduct of a now-defunct security consultancy that he chaired after he left the military.
Gantz is not a suspect in the case, but Netanyahu seized on it to try to undermine his less experienced opponent.
Gantz has also made occasional stumbles in campaign interviews, getting an interviewer's name wrong and stammering slightly while collecting his thoughts.
Netanyahu has used these stumbles as ammunition to accuse Gantz as lacking the capacity for quick thinking.
""So I don’t speak like you. Big deal,"" Gantz responded brusquely during a televised speech on Wednesday. ""While you were taking acting classes in New York, I was defending this country.""

LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - Talibshah Hosini played some tough roles as an actor in Afghanistan before he fled. None was as hard as his real-life fight for survival in a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos.
The 35-year-old from Faryab province in Afghanistan left a career in theater and film in his home country and now spends his days trying to keep his family safe in a makeshift shack made of pieces of wood and metal.
""In the 18 years since I became part of the cinema, I have played many tough roles, but this role is the most difficult one,"" he said.
Forced to flee after receiving threats for staging satires at his theater company that focused on the hardline Islamist Taliban movement, his journey with his wife and three daughters took them to Iran, then to Turkey and eventually Greece.
Hosini built a shelter in an olive grove next to the official Moria camp. The grove itself has become a tent city after Moria overflowed.
He and his wife Yasamin wake up before dawn and enter Moria, taking turns to wait in line for three hours to receive meals.
The food is not enough for the family of five, so they cook for themselves on a stove made from an empty can filled with charcoal and wood.
Afraid of being robbed or hurt, they spend most of the time in their shelter.
""We have seen things that should not be spoken of. I myself can't sleep at night, just in case someone walks into the tent with a knife and stabs me, god forbid, (or) does something awful to my wife,"" Hosini said.
""I don't trust anyone, not even our neighbors, because they change all the time.""
The couple will not let their daughters, Farima, 9, Parisa, 6 and Marjan, 3 venture out of the shelter alone, fearing they will be assaulted or kidnapped.
Hosini said the girls suffered from depression.
""Their behavior has changed, their spirit has changed, their way of thinking has been changed.""
His family's asylum interview is not for another year-and-a-half. Tears well up when he is asked what he will do if the application is rejected.
""It is hard to say, very hard to say because if our case isn't accepted here and we have to go back to Afghanistan, what will I do in Afghanistan? If we go back my children's futures are ruined,"" he said through tears.
This family's asylum request is one of tens of thousands backed up in Greece. In Moria camp, more than 19,000 live in a space built for 3,000.
There have been attempted suicides, fights that end in injuries and self-harming. Deaths from attacks and accidents have also occurred. The camps are overflowing with garbage and the portable toilets are filthy.
There is not much to do, said Hosini. He practices kung fu to keep himself fit, living in the hope that one day he will return to his profession as an actor when he leaves Lesbos.

NAIROBI/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Countries in East Africa are racing against time to prevent new swarms of locusts wreaking havoc with crops and livelihoods after the worst infestation in generations.
A lack of expertise in controlling the pests is not their only problem: Kenya temporarily ran out of pesticides, Ethiopia needs more planes and Somalia and Yemen, torn by civil war, can't guarantee exterminators' safety.
Locust swarms have been recorded in the region since biblical times, but unusual weather patterns exacerbated by climate change have created ideal conditions for insect numbers to surge, scientists say.
Warmer seas are creating more rain, wakening dormant eggs, and cyclones that disperse the swarms are getting stronger and more frequent.
In Ethiopia the locusts have reached the fertile Rift Valley farmland and stripped grazing grounds in Kenya and Somalia. Swarms can travel up to 150 km (93 miles) a day and contain between 40-80 million locusts per square kilometer.
If left unchecked, the number of locusts in East Africa could explode 400-fold by June. That would devastate harvests in a region with more than 19 million hungry people, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has warned.
Uganda has deployed the military. Kenya has trained hundreds of youth cadets to spray. Lacking pesticides, some security forces in Somalia have shot anti-aircraft guns at swarms darkening the skies.
Everyone is racing the rains expected in March: the next generation of larvae is already wriggling from the ground, just as farmers plant their seeds. 
""The second wave is coming,"" said Cyril Ferrand, FAO's head of resilience for Eastern Africa. ""As crops are planted, locusts will eat everything.""
The impact so far on agriculture, which generates about a third of East Africa's economic output, is unknown, but FAO is using satellite images to assess the damage, he said.
PESTICIDE SHORTAGES 
In Kenya, the region's wealthiest and most stable country, the locusts are mostly in the semi-arid north, although some crops have been affected, said Stanley Kipkoech, a senior official at the Ministry of Agriculture.
This month, Kenya ran out of pesticide for about a week and a half, he said. Farmers watched helplessly as their families' crops were devoured.
In Ethiopia, the government can only afford to rent four planes for aerial spraying, but it needs at least twice that number to contain the outbreak before harvesting begins in March, Zebdewos Salato, director of plant protection at the Ministry of Agriculture, told Reuters.
""We are running out of time,"" he said.
Ethiopia's single pesticide factory is working flat out.
The country needs 500,000 liters for the upcoming harvest and planting season but is struggling to produce its maximum 200,000 liters after foreign exchange shortages delayed the purchase of chemicals, the factory's chief executive Simeneh Altaye said.
FAO is helping the government to procure planes, vehicles and sprayers, said Fatouma Seid, the agency's representative in Ethiopia. It is also urgently trying to buy pesticides from Europe.

MONEY AND GUNS 
Pest controllers in Somalia can't enter areas controlled by the Islamist al Shabaab insurgency, said Aidid Suleiman Hashi, environment minister for the southern region of Jubbaland.
When the locusts invaded, residents blew horns, beat drums and rang bells to scare away the insects. Al Shabaab fired anti-craft and machine guns at the swarms, Hashi said. Jubbaland forces, not to be outdone, did so too.
Under such circumstances, contractors are reluctant to do aerial spraying, FAO said.
Meanwhile, locusts - which have a life cycle of three months - are breeding. FAO says each generation is an average of 20 times more numerous.
When eggs hatch, as they are doing now in northern Kenya, the hungry young locusts are earthbound for two weeks and more vulnerable to spraying than when they grow wings.
After that, they take to the air in swarms so dense they have forced aircraft to divert. A single square kilometer swarm can eat as much food in a day as 35,000 people.
FAO said containing the plague will cost at least $138 million. So far, donors have pledged $52 million. Failure means more hunger in a region already battered by conflict and climate shocks. 
Since 2016, there have been droughts in Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, then floods, Ferrand said. In South Sudan, more than half the population already faces food shortages.
CLIMATE CHANGE
The rains that blessed the region with a bumper crop last year after a prolonged drought also brought a curse. 
A cyclical weather pattern in the Indian Ocean, intensified by rising sea temperatures, contributed to one of the wettest October-December rainy seasons in five decades, said Nathanial Matthews of the Stockholm-based Global Resilience Partnership, a public-private partnership focused on climate change.
Locusts hatched in Yemen, largely ignored in the chaos of the civil war. They migrated across the Red Sea to the Horn of Africa, then spread to Sudan, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya. Now they have been spotted in Uganda, South Sudan and Tanzania.

The rains awoke the dormant eggs then stronger and more numerous cyclones scattered the insects. Eight cyclones tore across the Indian Ocean in 2019, the highest number in a single year since records began, said Matthews.

Parliament adjourned a session to approve a cabinet proposed by Prime Minister-designate Mohammed Allawi because of a lack of quorum, state TV reported, after lawmakers who opposed his nominees boycotted the session.
Political infighting and alleged widespread corruption have crippled Iraq's efforts to recover from two U.S. invasions, sanctions and the destructive war to defeat Islamic State in 2017.
The country faces a mass protest movement that broke out in October and brought down former Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi two months later. His cabinet has stayed on in a caretaker capacity, however.
The protests, which first demanded jobs and services, quickly turned into calls for the removal of Iraq's entire ruling elite. Protesters oppose Allawi because they view him as part of the system they want to bring down.
Security forces and powerful militia groups have shot dead hundreds of mostly unarmed demonstrators. Around 500 people have been killed in unrest since October, most of them protesters, according to a Reuters rally from medics and police. The number of protesters has reduced somewhat but demonstrations continue on a daily basis.
Allawi issued a long list of promises when he was nominated this month: to hold early elections, punish people who killed protesters, end foreign interference and check the power of non-state armed groups - an ambitious program for a prime minister who has no particular party behind him.
Abdul Mahdi became beholden to the interests of Iran-backed Shi'ite Muslim paramilitary groups and other parties that have a strong representation in parliament and control government posts.
Government officials say Allawi's cabinet selection was heavily influenced by renegade Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has gained from the general chaos in Iraq after the United States killed a senior Iranian commander in Baghdad in January
Sunni and Kurdish political groups who stood to lose portfolios in a cabinet of ostensible independents have vehemently opposed Allawi's choices.

According to Iraq's constitution, Allawi must get a cabinet approved through parliament or President Barham Salih will need to appoint a new candidate for prime minister.

France, which blocked the opening of talks with Tirana and Skopje in October, indicated earlier in February that membership talks could start if the European Commission gave them a positive review in March.
Varhelyi said that the Commission's report, due to be released next week, was encouraging.
""There is serious progress in both countries. I am very encouraged by the fact that these two countries have chosen to accelerate (their preparations),"" he said after a meeting of the Visegrad Group with the western Balkans states hosted by Prague.
""With this report I do hope to convince member states that they are ready and we should be ready to open negotiations,"" Varhelyi said, adding he hoped ""very much to start negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania in the coming weeks"".
If allowed to go ahead with membership talks, approval would set the stage for a summit with EU leaders and all six western Balkan candidate countries - Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia and North Macedonia - in Zagreb in May.
French President Emmanuel Macron had refused to approve the start of accession negotiations at a summit in October, saying the process of admitting new members needed to change.
This month, the Commission suggested reforms to the accession process along the lines of a French proposal made in November, giving EU governments more say and making it easier to stop or reset negotiations and freeze funds.
Membership talks usually take years to complete."

Nemtsov, one of President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critics, was killed in 2015 as he walked home across a bridge near the Kremlin's walls. He had been working on a report examining Russia's role in the conflict in Ukraine.
Russia jailed a man in 2017 for 20 years for the murder and handed down terms of between 11 and 19 years to four other men convicted of being his accomplices.
But the late politician's allies, who are due to hold a commemorative march in his memory in the Russian capital this weekend, have criticized the investigation for failing to identify the people who ordered the killing.
Bart Gorman, charges d'affaires at the U.S. embassy in Moscow, was one of several foreign diplomats on Thursday who paid their respects at the bridge and laid flowers.
""...We again call on Russian authorities to investigate those who organized and ordered this horrific crime,"" U.S. embassy spokeswoman Rebecca Ross wrote on Twitter.
Nemtsov ""remains an inspiration to all who strive for justice, democracy, and a government accountable to the people"", she wrote.
Czech authorities said earlier this month they would rename the square in Prague where Russia's embassy is located after Nemtsov."
310,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 07:43AM ET</span>",Slovak businessman tried for reporter's murder jailed for 19 years in TV station scam,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - A Slovak businessman charged with the 2018 murder of a journalist in a case that brought down the government was sentenced on Thursday to 19 years jail in a separate trial for forging documents to steal money from a TV station.
Marian Kocner, an influential figure in Slovak business and political circles, was found guilty of forging 69 million euros ($75 million) worth of promissory notes to siphon money from Markiza, a top Slovak television station.
Prosecutors have separately accused Kocner of orchestrating the killing of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak, which led to mass protests and forced the resignation of Prime Minister Robert Fico, Slovakia's dominant politician for more than a decade. The fallout of the murder case could force Fico's ruling Smer party out of power in an election this Saturday.
Kocner has denied any wrongdoing in both cases.
Markiza is owned by Central European Media Enterprises (CME), a publicly listed operator of central and eastern European TV stations whose majority shareholder is AT&T in the United States.
Kocner was sentenced in the forgery case along with Pavol Rusko, who served as economy minister in 2003-2005 and as the boss and co-owner of Markiza in 1995-2000 before CME took control of it. Rusko had also denied guilt.
""They are found guilty of the felony of forgery, altering and unauthorized manufacturing of money and securities,"" judge Emil Klemanic of the Specialised Criminal Court said in a ruling broadcast live by news website dennikn.sk. ""Acting together, they forged securities with the aim to present them as real.""
Prosecutors said Rusko worked with Kocner to try to collect debts owed to Markiza using forged promissory notes falsely dated to 2000. Markiza filed a criminal complaint against the men in 2018 and the pair were indicted by a special prosecutor's office in 2019.
CME said in its 2019 annual report it did not believe that the notes were signed in 2000 or that the notes were authentic.
Kocner and Rusko asked not to be present for the ruling. They can appeal the decision.
CME shareholders including AT&T were due to vote at a general meeting on Thursday on plans to sell the business to the PPF Group owned by Czech businessman Petr Kellner."

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's health minister defended the country's screening process for coronavirus on Thursday and said the absence of confirmed cases in the world's fourth-most populous nation was a ""blessing from the Almighty"".
The sprawling Southeast Asian country of more than 260 million people has not recorded any cases though some of its citizens overseas have contracted the virus, including eight crew on the Diamond Princess cruise liner off Japan's Yokohama.
Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto said 134 test samples taken from people suspected of having the coronavirus had turned out negative.
""If until this second all came out negative, then it's a blessing from the Almighty,"" he told reporters.
Putranto said tests on two patients who died this week after suffering symptoms associated with contracting the virus had been negative.
On Feb. 23, a Singaporean man died after reportedly suffering fever and shortness of breath in the city of Batam, but the head of the local health agency said this was due to another unspecified disease.
The death of a 37-year-old man in Semarang in Central Java who was suffering pneumonia after returning from overseas was not caused by the coronavirus, but by H1N1 flu, he said.
Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in the United States, said in a study this month that Indonesia should strengthen outbreak surveillance and control - especially as it had direct flights from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
The Harvard team said Indonesia's lack of confirmed cases ""may suggest the potential for undetected cases"" as air travel may contribute to cases being exported from China.
WHO IS ""QUITE CONFIDENT""
Indonesia has barred entry to visitors who have been in China for 14 days and stopped all flights to and from there.
Indonesia has tested relatively few people in comparison to some neighbors and its population, but Putranto said tests were conducted when ""doctors determine they have symptoms that point to that direction.""
""Imagine if everybody who had a cough or flu was checked, then millions would be checked,"" he said.
Navaratnasamy Paranietharan, the World Health Organization's Indonesia representative, has said the WHO was ""quite confident that Indonesia is ready to be able to respond to this situation.""
Separately, Indonesia will send a Garuda Indonesia (JK:GIAA) plane in the next few days to Japan to pick up 68 of its citizens working aboard the coronavirus-affected Diamond Princess, officials said.
The crew could be quarantined for up to 28 days on Sebaru island in the Java Sea north off Jakarta, where 188 crew members from another cruise ship are also being held in quarantine.
The coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people globally and killed nearly 2,800, the majority in China."

SEOUL (Reuters) - From inside his car, a driver is checked for any fever or breathing difficulties by medical staff in protective clothing and goggles who lean in through the window at a new drive-thru coronavirus clinic in South Korea.
He drove off after the brief test showed he was clear.
Others queuing in their vehicles in the city of Goyang were instructed to stop briefly to submit a sample of secretions for closer examination, with the entire procedure taking less than 10 minutes.
""I initially went to a community health center and had to wait more than one hour, so this is easier and faster,"" the first driver told local broadcaster YTN.
None of the drivers nor medical workers gave their names, the stigma of even being tested making people cautious.
A growing number of local governments in South Korea are launching the roadside testing facilities this week, as demand soars for checks and increasing waiting times raise the risk of infection.
South Korea reported 505 new cases on Thursday, marking its largest daily jump since the first patient was confirmed on Jan. 20, and taking the national tally to 1,766, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.
The temporary testing facility in Goyang, about 16 km northwest of capital Seoul, was opened on Wednesday at a public parking lot as more than 100 residents seek to get tested every day, the city said in a statement.
Goyang has not been badly hit so far, with just four patients, but sudden and rapid surges in infections in recent days have stoked fears of a nationwide transmission.
The majority of cases in South Korea are from the southeastern city of Daegu, the location of a church at the center of the country's outbreak, which has also opened a drive-thru facility.
Other cities, including Incheon and Sejong, have launched their own drive-thru testing clinics, while others plan to introduce one in the near future.
The facilities can cut testing time by as much as a third, officials said.
""Here we can test many people within a short period of time in a less crowded manner, and there are lower risks of infection because it's done inside the car,"" Kim An-hyun, chief of the Goyang community health center, told local broadcaster MBC."

The violence began over a disputed new citizenship law on Monday but led to clashes between Muslims and Hindus in which hundreds were injured. Many suffered gunshot wounds, while arson, looting and stone-throwing has also taken place.
""The death count is now at 32,"" Delhi police spokesman Anil Mittal said, adding the ""entire area is peaceful now."" 
At the heart of the unrest is a citizenship law which makes it easier for non-Muslims from some neighboring Muslim-dominated countries to gain Indian citizenship.
Critics say the law is biased against Muslims and undermines India's secular constitution.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has denied having any bias against India's 180 million Muslims, saying that law is required to help persecuted minorities.
New Delhi has been the epicenter for protests against the new law, with students and large sections of the Muslim community leading the protests.
As the wounded were brought to hospitals on Thursday, the focus shifted on the overnight transfer of Justice S. Muralidhar, a Delhi High Court judge who was hearing a petition into the riots and had criticized government and police inaction on Wednesday.
Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the transfer was routine and had been recommended by the Supreme Court collegium earlier this month.
The opposition Congress party leader Manish Tiwari said every lawyer and judge in India should strongly protest what he called a crude attempt to intimidate the judiciary.
Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said inflammatory speeches at the protests over the new citizenship law in the last few months and the tacit support of some opposition leaders was behind the violence.

""We are currently carrying out a large-scale complex (of measures) for the total deratization of the city, catching wild animals, strays,"" Elena Andreeva, the Moscow head of the Rospotrepnadzor consumer health watchdog, was quoted as saying by the RIA news agency.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - As deadly clashes between Hindu and Muslim groups rocked parts of the Indian capital Delhi this week, the family of a young Hindu woman living in a Muslim-majority area was forced to cancel her wedding.
Dressed in her wedding finery, her hands laced maroon with henna and her skin cleansed with turmeric, 23-year-old Savitri Prasad said she was weeping in her home as violent mobs battled outside on Tuesday, which was to have been her wedding day.
But Savitri's father then organized the wedding for the following day, saying his Muslim neighbors were family and he was comforted by their presence.
""My Muslim brothers are protecting me today,"" Savitri told a Reuters team that visited the house on the day of the ceremony, breaking down again as her family and neighbors comforted her.
The rituals took place at Savitri's home, a small brick building in a narrow alley in the Chand Bagh district. Steps away, the main street looked like a war zone, with cars and shops vandalized, a Muslim shrine torched and the area littered with rocks used in pitched battles between mobs on both sides.
At least 32 people have been killed in the fighting in Chand Bagh and nearby areas of the capital this week, and hundreds of Hindus and Muslims have been injured in the worst sectarian riots in the Indian capital in decades.
""We went to the terrace and just saw smoke and more smoke,"" Bhoday Prasad, Savitri's father, said of the scene on Monday and Tuesday. ""It is terrifying. We just want peace.""
Bhoday Prasad said he has lived in the area for years alongside Muslims without any trouble.
""We don't know who the people behind the violence are, but they are not my neighbors. There is no enmity between Hindus and Muslims here.""
On Monday evening, the day Savitri was to have henna applied on her hands in a pre-wedding ritual, violence had already spiraled out of control.
""We could hear a lot of commotion outside, but I had the henna applied, hoping things would be better next day,"" she said. Instead, they got worse.
Her father told the groom and his family it was too dangerous to come to the house.
""Our heart pains for her, who would want their daughter to be sitting home crying when she is supposed to be happy?"" said Sameena Begum, one of the Muslim neighbors.
Violence ebbed on Wednesday, but markets remained shut and residents stayed indoors, fearful of further clashes. Savitri’s father said he decided to organize a scaled-down ceremony.
""Hindu or Muslim, we are all humans and we are all terrified of the violence,"" said Savitri's cousin Pooja, as she helped the bride dress for the ceremony. ""This fight was not about religion, but it has been made so.""
Muslim neighbors gathered to offer blessings as the groom arrived and the wedding rituals took place, with a Hindu priest reciting holy verses and the groom and bride taking the rounds of a small pyre set up inside the house.
""We live peacefully with our Hindu brothers,"" said Aamir Malik, who was standing guard with several other men outside the home. ""We are everything for them. It's been like that. We are here for them.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The phrase ""Fack Ju Goehte"", the title of a successful German film which refers to the country's most famous writer, does not seem to have offended Germans, Europe's top court said on Thursday, ordering trademark authorities to rethink their veto.
The long-running row started in 2015 when the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) dismissed an application by Constantin Film, co-producer of the 2013 film, to trademark the title and use it for goods and services.
The patent body said the pronunciation of the words ""Fack Ju"" was identical to an English expletive, was shocking and vulgar, and also offended Goethe posthumously.
A lower tribunal in 2018 backed the rejection, prompting Constantin Film to appeal to the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), Europe's highest.
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who died in 1832, was a literary giant whose works include the play Faust, the epistolary novel The Sorrows of Young Werther, and numerous poems and plays.
Schools named after Goethe are found all over Germany while the country's international cultural institute is called the Goethe Institute.
The CJEU said the title of the film did not appear to have stirred up controversy among film goers, while even the Goethe Institute used the film for educational purposes.
""EUIPO must give a fresh decision on the application made by Constantin Film for registration of the sign Fack Ju Goehte as an EU trade mark,"" the CJEU said.
""EUIPO and the General Court, which both found that the sign is contrary to accepted principles of morality, failed to take sufficient account of the fact that the title of a comedic film does not appear to have been perceived as morally unacceptable by the German-speaking public at large.""
The title referred to graffiti painted on a train by one of the characters in the film. The 2013 film, which was also a success in Austria, spawned two sequels in 2015 and 2017.

Francis is missing a part of one lung. It was removed when he was in his early 20s in his native Buenos Aires after he suffered from tuberculosis, according to biographer Austen Ivereigh.
He also suffers some leg pain due to sciatica, for which he undergoes regular physical therapy and which explains his occasional difficulty climbing steps.
But he is in generally good health and has been able to endure about four grueling international trips each year since his election in 2013.

In a speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council, the former Chilean president decried Washington's moves to roll back environmental protections, including for waterways and wetlands, in its drive to deregulate the U.S. economy.
""Untreated pollutants may now be poured directly into millions of miles of streams and rivers, putting ecosystems, drinking water and human health at risk. Weaker fuel emission standards for vehicles and decreased regulations on the oil and gas industries could also harm human rights,"" Bachelet said.
Trump has pared back some protections on public lands including in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Utah's Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments that may eventually allow companies to stake claims for drilling and mining in these regions.
Bachelet also criticized U.S. migration policies that she said raised significant human rights concerns.
""Reducing the number of people trying to enter the country should not be done in disregard of (international) asylum and migrant protections. The situation of children in detention is of particular concern,"" she said.
Since January 2019, the Trump administration has sent migrants, mostly from Central America, back to Mexico under a policy called Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), which is also known as Remain in Mexico.

Indonesia is the world's biggest Muslim-majority country and it often sends around 1 million people on the Umrah pilgrimage every year in the kingdom, which hosts the two holiest sites of Islam in Mecca and Medina.
The Saudi ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement that the suspensions were temporary but provided no timeframe for their expiry. It was unclear if the haj pilgrimage, which is scheduled to begin in late July, would be impacted.
""The immediacy of this will impact our citizens because at the time of the announcement, there are Indonesian citizens or maybe citizens of other countries who have flown there,"" Indonesia's foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, told reporters on Thursday.
The government was trying to convince the Saudi authorities to allow the Indonesians already there to complete their pilgrimage.
More than 1,100 pilgrims had left for Saudi Arabia on Thursday from Jakarta's airport, CNN Indonesia cited an official at Indonesia's religious ministry as saying, while around 1,500 had been asked to postpone their trips.
TV footage showed hundreds of pilgrims, some dressed in uniforms provided by travel agents, stranded at Jakarta's airport.
Joko Asmoro of the Association of Muslim Haj and Umrah Organizers, told Reuters that 150,000 to 200,000 pilgrims could be impacted by the suspension over the next month.
Asmoro said organizers would reschedule flights for the pilgrims ""until the Saudi government opens Umrah again.""
Saudi Arabia normally welcomes millions of Muslim visitors throughout the year, with a peak for the haj pilgrimage. It introduced a new tourism visa last October for 49 countries.
The country has had no cases of the coronavirus, but it has been spreading in some neighboring countries. Indonesia also has not recorded any cases.
President Joko Widodo said he respected the kingdom's decision because ""everything health-related is the Saudi government's number one policy"".
But for many Indonesians preparing for the pilgrimage the news is potentially devastating.
Fitri Nur Arifenie, who is due to take part in the Umrah on March 23, said she was now worried her trip would be canceled.
""It's heartbreaking because everything's on schedule. I have long desired to go on the Umrah,"" said Arifenie, who works for Korean trade promotion agency.
""But what can you do? It's for the good of others."""

LONDON (Reuters) - The expansion of Heathrow Airport was declared unlawful by an appeal court judge on Thursday, a major setback for the $18 billion project that could prompt the British government to pull its support for a third runway. 
The new runway was approved by the government in 2018, but British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously opposed expanding Heathrow, Britain and Europe's busiest airport. 
During last year's election campaign, Johnson said he would have to find some way of honoring an old promise to lie down in front of bulldozers at Heathrow to halt the expansion plans.
The judge said on Thursday that the government had not sought permission to appeal the ruling in the supreme court, meaning that it will now have to rework the policy if it wants it to go ahead.
Heathrow Airport said, however, that it would be appeal to the Supreme Court, and that recent commitments made by the aviation industry on meeting carbon commitments by 2050 were in with the Paris Agreement. 
In his ruling, the judge said that in its current form the government's policy was unlawful as it failed to take into account climate change commitments made by the government when it signed up to the Paris Agreement in 2015.
""The government when it published the ANPS (Airports National Policy Statement) had not taken into account its own firm policy commitments on climate change under the Paris agreement. That, in our view, is legally fatal to the ANPS in its present form,"" said judge Keith Lindblom. 
Thursday's ruling was a victory for environmental campaigners such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, and local authorities who oppose the expansion. 
Heathrow Airport, which is owned by Ferrovial, Qatar Investment Authority and China Investment Corp, argues that Britain's exit from the European Union, makes a new runway critical to ensuring that the UK can continue to increase trade with the rest of the world. 
The airport's two runways are operating at full capacity meaning that it cannot add new flights to drive exports and trade links. In two years, Heathrow be overtaken as the busiest airport in Europe by Paris, whose Charles de Gaulle hub has four runways. 

Under the 14 billion pound ($18.2 billion) plan , Heathrow's new runway would open in 2028.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The new leader of the disgraced Legionaries of Christ Catholic religious order, whose founder was a serial sexual abuser, has promised to turn a page as the group enacted new norms to protect children.
Father John Conner, 51, an American who was elected this month as superior general, announced the changes on Wednesday night as he wrapped up a general chapter attended by 66 representatives from around the world.
Conner, the order's first non-Mexican leader, said in a statement the Legionaries wanted a ""change of the institutional culture that allowed so much suffering to occur"". 
The chapter approved documents outlining commitments for the protection of minors and vulnerable adults and for reckoning with its scandalous past.
The Legionaries formally retract criticisms made in past smear campaigns against 11 whistle-blowers who tried to expose abuse by Mexican founder Father Marcial Maciel.
Maciel was perhaps the Roman Catholic Church's most notorious pedophile, even abusing children he had fathered secretly with at least two women while living a double life and being feted by the Vatican and Church conservatives.
Although allegations were made against him as early as 1954, the Vatican and the order only began acknowledging Maciel's abuse in 2006, and details about his most notorious misdeeds did not emerge until after his death in 2008.
Last December, an internal report covering the period from when Maciel founded the group in Mexico 1941 to 2019 showed that he had abused at least 60 boys and that he had built a cult-like organization where sexual abuse and abuse of power by superiors was rife.
The order currently has about 1,500 priests and seminarians and 22,500 lay members. 
Former Pope Benedict resisted calls from some in the Church who said the order should be dissolved because it was toxic to the core. The Vatican instead took over the order in 2010 and began a process of reform.
The new norms promise a ""rapid response"" to any claim of inappropriate behavior, more background checks for candidates for the priesthood, internal tribunals, an option for alleged victims to be heard by outside authorities, and a commitment to see the media not as enemies but ""allies in making reparation for wrong and bringing about the good"".
They also pledge to lobby the Vatican to defrock those convicted of abuse, to cooperate with civil authorities, and to not impose confidentiality clauses in agreements unless requested by victims. 
After Maciel's death, Vatican investigations found that he had fathered several children with at least two women, visited them regularly and sent them money. He also used drugs.
Former members have said the order was run like a cult, with rules forbidding any criticism of the founder or questioning of his motives.
They said Maciel gave huge contributions to the Vatican during the papacy of John Paul, who admired the Legionaries' orthodoxy and ability to produce vocations.
The Catholic Church around the world is still struggling to come to grips with the worldwide crisis, which involves cases of abuse dating back to decades ago.
It has devastated the Church's credibility and dented its coffers. About two dozen dioceses in the United States alone have filed for bankruptcy because of mounting lawsuits.

A number of U.S. states have also changed statutes of limitations law enabling victims to file for damages for abuse that occurred decades ago.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - A major Kenyan university has caused widespread public offense by accusing a student who was gang-raped of ""recklessness"" for walking back to campus after a night out.
The University of Nairobi's security office sent a memo on Monday about robbery and rape reports. ""In all three incidences reported since last year, a clear case of recklessness on the part of the female student can be drawn,"" it said.
The memo highlighted one case when it said a female student ""entertained herself in various joints around the city and decided to walk all alone (drunk)"" when her bag was snatched and three men raped her.
Personalities including former presidential candidate Martha Karua and activist and rape survivor Adelle Onyango, founder of ""No Means No"", tweeted their disgust at the memo.
""A rape survivor should never be blamed. That is transferring the responsibility of crime to a survivor of a crime,"" Wairimu Munyinyi Wahome, executive director of the Coalition on Violence Against Women, told Reuters.
Nearly 5,500 people signed up in a day to an online petition asking the university to see rapists as the ""true antagonists"".
The outrage brought an apology from the university.
""The memo was insensitive and does not represent the corporate values and image of University of Nairobi,"" vice chancellor Stephen Kiama said in an online note on Wednesday.
Ann Mwangi Mvurya, the first female head of the students' union, declined to comment to Reuters.
The spokesman for the National Police Service was not immediately reachable for comment on the incident.
Latest Kenyan government data show 921 rapes were reported in 2018, but experts say many assaults go unreported.
Violent crimes against women frequently make front pages, with women being attacked, mutilated or killed. Some women and girls have reported being raped by police when they sought help, according to a watchdog.
Police have said in the past that any of its officers caught committing crimes have been arrested."

Attilio Fontana, who has held repeated news conferences this past week to explain how his region is dealing with the flare-up, announced the news on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) late on Wednesday and videoed himself putting on a surgical face mask.
""For now I don't have any type of infection so I can continue to work ... but for two weeks I will try to live in a sort of self-isolation,"" he said on Facebook.
More than 300 people have tested positive over the past week for coronavirus in Lombardy, which is centered on Italy's financial capital Milan, and 10 people have died in the region.
Across all of Italy, more than 400 people have contracted the disease and 12 have died -- the worst contagion so far recorded in Europe.
World Health Organization (WHO) executive committee member Walter Ricciardi has suggested that the numbers in Italy might be exaggerated, saying only 190 cases had been fully confirmed in a two-step verification process. The other samples were still awaiting results.
Ricciardi, who is also a consultant for the government in its fight against the virus, told Corriere della Sera newspaper that Veneto, the second-most impacted region, had decided to test hundreds of people, even if they showed no symptoms.
He said some them were testing positive, even though they were clearly not ill, adding that this was unnecessarily fuelling the alarm. ""Whoever gave the order to test even those without symptoms ... made a mistake,"" he said.
Local authorities said on Wednesday that some 9,462 tests had been carried out in Italy over the past week.
Analysts have warned that the outbreak could shunt Italy's fragile economy into its fourth recession in 12 years, with many businesses in the wealthy north close to a standstill and hotels reporting a wave of cancellations.
Claudio Marenzi, head of fashion at the industrialist lobby Confindustria, said the textile and clothing sectors were taking a battering, with international buyers pulling their orders out of an irrational fear that the product might be infected.

The proposed regulations from the city government list nine meats that are permitted for consumption, including pork, chicken, beef and rabbit, as well as fish and seafood.
""Banning the consumption of wild animals is a common practice in developed countries and is a universal requirement of modern civilization,"" the notice said.
Scientists suspect that the new virus passed to humans from animals. Some of the earliest infections were found in people who had exposure to a wildlife market in Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, where bats, snakes, civets and other animals were sold.
The document recognized dogs and cats' status as pets and would ban their consumption. Snakes, turtles and frogs were excluded from the approved list, despite being popular dishes in China's south.
A ban on eating dog and cat meat in Shenzhen would be ""extremely welcome,"" said Peter Li, China policy expert for Humane Society International, an animal welfare group.
""Although the trade in Shenzhen is fairly small compared with the rest of [Guangdong] province, Shenzhen is still a huge city and is larger than Wuhan, so this would be very significant and could even have a domino effect with other cities following.""
The other permitted meats are lamb, donkey, ducks, geese and pigeon. The proposal noted there are more than 2,000 species of protected wildlife in China.
Shenzhen's proposal follows a decision by the central government on Monday for an immediate ban in the trade and consumption of wild animals, after an initial suspension in January.
The State Forestry and Grassland Administration is also moving to expand the scope of protected wildlife, and will revoke licenses for wildlife breeding organizations found to be breeding for consumption, Xinhua reported on Thursday.
Those caught eating protected animals would be fined up to 20,000 yuan ($2,850) and up to 2,000 yuan for non-protected animals, according to the draft. Shops serving protected meat face fines of up to 50,000 yuan.
The public will have until Thursday to respond to the draft, according to the document.
In Yulin, a city in the neighboring province of Guangxi famous for its dog meat festival, most dog slaughter operations have closed in the past two months because of restrictions on moving dogs across provincial borders, Li said."

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - El Salvador's Congress on Wednesday narrowly approved a controversial law intended to allow the prosecution of crimes committed during the country's bloody civil war, although President Nayib Bukele said he would veto it.
While proponents argue the law is meant to ensure that nobody receives an amnesty or pardon for their crimes during the civil war, opponents, including human rights organizations, argue it will achieve the opposite.
Bukele called it ""an amnesty law that protects war criminals"" and said he would veto it. If he does not, it will become law within 60 days of being officially announced.
The law covers compensation, reparations, history and access to military and police archives, and makes it illegal to praise disgraced characters for their role during the civil war.
One of the main criticisms, however, is that it allows judges to significantly commute sentences for reasons of health or age, or because alleged perpetrators collaborate. It was approved by 44 out of 84 possible votes.
El Salvador's civil war that pitted the former Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation (FMLN) against the army lasted from 1980 to 1992 and left 75,000 dead as well as 8,000 missing.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The political chaos Mahathir Mohamad, 94, plunged Malaysia into this week by resigning as prime minister has turned into a new showdown between him and his old rival Anwar Ibrahim, 72.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
Mahathir has proposed a unified administration without political party allegiances. Some lawmakers have announced their support for him.
Anwar, who has been waiting to be premier for 20 years, has been named as the prime ministerial candidate for three parties from the former Pakatan Harapan (PH) ruling coalition. He said he was opposed to forming a ""backdoor government"", as suggested by Mahathir.
The ball is now in the king's court after he met all 222 elected members of parliament to seek their views on who should lead or whether fresh elections should be called.
Mahathir has outfoxed opponents for decades during two stints as prime minister. The first was from 1981 to 2003 and the second since 2018, when he joined with Anwar to oust the party that had held power for 60 years over accusations of widespread corruption.
WHAT'S BEHIND THE RESIGNATION?
At the root of the turmoil is Mahathir's promise to hand over power to Anwar under the terms of a pre-election pact.
Mahathir had been under pressure from Anwar's supporters to set a clear timetable for ceding power, but he had refused.
Mahathir said he quit because his party wanted to pull out of the Pakatan coalition and form a government with the parties they defeated in the last general election.
His decision followed surprise talks at the weekend between members of his coalition and the opposition on forming a new government.
Anwar was Mahathir's deputy during his earlier stint as prime minister, but they fell out over the handling of the Asian financial crisis and he was fired in 1998. Soon after, Anwar was jailed for sodomy, charges he says were trumped up.
WHAT COULD HAPPEN NEXT?
The king has given no sign of when a decision will be made and the attorney general has said there is no time frame for how long an interim prime minister can continue.
The fact that there are so many possible scenarios has deepened the turmoil. To win power, a coalition needs to convince the king it has the support of a minimum of 112 out of the 222 members of parliament. Some possibilities are:
* Mahathir returns as prime minister as the head of a unity government. He selects ministers from whichever party he likes.
* Mahathir returns as prime minister with support of a new coalition, potentially including old enemies.
* No side shows it can summon a clear majority and the king agrees to a new election. In that case, parties that lost in the last general election may have a strong chance.
* An electoral loss for Anwar's group may mean renewed focus on the country's decades-old positive discrimination policy for majority Malays, who enjoyed preferential access to everything from public financing to a 30% quota for equity holdings in businesses.
HOW IS THE PUBLIC MOOD?
People are confused and want the crisis resolved. There is still support for Mahathir but some have said fresh elections are a better option.
A coalition of NGOs, led by pro-electoral reform group Bersih 2.0, has raised the possibility of a mass rally.
The atmosphere is not helped by the flagging economy.
Malaysia's economic growth slowed to the weakest in a decade in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the coronavirus outbreak threatens to pile on more pressure. Mahathir will announce a stimulus package on Thursday."

Milwaukee (Reuters) - A gunman opened fire at the  Molson Coors  Beverage Co brewing complex in Milwaukee on Wednesday, killing five co-workers before he was found dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, the city's police chief said.
No one else was injured in the violence at the sprawling campus of more than 20 buildings, where some 1,400 workers are employed by the beer company in Wisconsin's largest city, Milwaukee Police Chief Alfonso Morales said.
The entire Molson Coors property was placed under a security lockdown for several hours following the gunfire as police swept each building to rule out any further threats or victims.
""We can now say that the scene is secure. All employees who were on scene have been allowed to go home,"" Morales told reporters at a late-night news conference several hours after the afternoon shooting.
Morales said the bloodshed was confined to the Molson Coors (N:TAP) complex west of downtown - a facility known to locals as the old Miller brewery - and that ""no members of the general public were involved."" 
Miller beer is one of the company's leading brands, and Mayor Tom Barrett said the plant has been part of the city for 165 years.
Morales said the body of the dead gunman, who was believed to have acted alone, was found in the same building as his five victims.
The suspect was described by police as a 51-year-old Milwaukee resident and employee of Molson Coors. Details about the circumstances of the shooting, including what may have precipitated the carnage, were not provided by authorities.
""We are a family here at Molson Coors in Milwaukee, and this is an unthinkable tragedy for us,"" company President and Chief Executive Officer Gavin Hattersley told reporters. 
President Donald Trump, acknowledging the shooting hours earlier as he opened a White House news conference about the coronavirus outbreak, referred to the gunman as a ""wicked murderer"" and called the gun violence ""a terrible thing.""
""Our hearts go out to the people of Wisconsin and to the families,"" he said.
PRAYERS, CONDOLENCES, SOMBER TOASTS
At a news conference earlier in the evening, the mayor branded the shooting ""an unspeakable tragedy.""
""There were five individuals who went to work today just like everybody goes to work. They thought they were going to work and return to their families. They didn't, and tragically they never will.""
In the immediate aftermath of the bloodshed, the company advised employees in an email that the gunman had been located in or near a second-floor stairwell near a packaging facility, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.
Hours later at Spitfires on State, a tavern a few blocks from the shooting scene, patrons made solemn toasts to Miller, an iconic Milwaukee brand. A small group of employees, still wearing their protective gear from their shift earlier in the day at the brewery, huddled together inside the bar.
“Prayers and condolences,” one female employee said as she left the bar after hugging two co-workers.
The Milwaukee shooting seemed likely to reignite a contentious debate about gun control in the midst of the U.S. presidential election. 
The campaign of Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, was set to host a roundtable discussion about gun violence at an event in Los Angeles on Thursday. 
A campaign spokeswoman said the event, which Bloomberg was not planning to attend, was previously scheduled, but added, ""recent events will likely be discussed.""

Last year saw 417 mass shootings in the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive, the highest annual number since the nonprofit research group started keeping a tally in 2013. GVA defines a mass shooting as any in which at least four people, excluding the perpetrator, are shot.

SALT LAKE CITY (Reuters) - Legislation to effectively decriminalize polygamy among consenting adults in Utah overwhelmingly passed the state House of Representatives in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, moving it a step closer to becoming law. 
The measure reduces the criminal penalty for plural marriage from a felony to an infraction on par with a traffic ticket. It cleared the House on a vote of 70-3.
The bill, which originated in the Senate, now goes back to that body for a final vote to approve a technical amendment made in the House. Both chambers are controlled by a Republican majority.
Final Senate passage would send the bill to Utah Governor Gary Herbert, also a Republican. He has not indicated whether he would sign the measure into law.
Under current statutes, polygamy - typically involving a man who cohabitates with and purports to marry more than one wife - is classified as a third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.
If the bill becomes law, punishments for plural marriage would be limited to fines of up to $750 and community service.
However, fraudulent bigamy - in which an individual obtains licenses to marry more than one spouse without their knowledge, or seeks to wed someone underage without her consent - would remain a felony. It would also be treated as a felony if charged in connection with other crimes such as child abuse, fraud, homicide or human trafficking.
The bill’s Republican sponsor, Senator Deidre Henderson, has said her intent is not to legalize polygamy but to decriminalize it so that those from polygamous communities who are victims of crimes can come forward for help or to seek social services without fear of being prosecuted themselves. 
Opponents of the bill say current law should not be changed because polygamy is inherently dangerous and harmful to women and children, particularly girls, some of whom have been forced into marriages with older men.
Polygamy is a remnant of the early teachings of the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which officially abandoned the practice in 1890 and now excommunicates members found engaged in the practice. 
Fundamentalist Mormons, numbering an estimated 30,000 across the western United States, continue the practice, however, in the belief that if promises glorification in heaven."

Decades-old political rivals Mahathir, 94, and Anwar Ibrahim, 72, have both sought the prime minister's job, leaving the king to decide who governs the country next or whether fresh elections should be called.
Mahathir, who agreed to act as interim prime minister after resigning earlier this week amid political maneuvering between his coalition and the opposition, on Wednesday proposed a unified administration without political party allegiances.
A spokesman for Mahathir's office said Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah had called him for a meeting at 11 am (0300 GMT). The spokesman did not know why.
The king has met all the 222 elected members of parliament over two days in a bid to end the crisis, which comes as Malaysia faces a flagging economy and the impact of the new coronavirus.
The resignation of Mahathir broke apart a coalition with Anwar that had scored a surprise election victory in 2018, and was not part of a pre-election promise that Mahathir would eventually cede power to Anwar.
Anwar said on Wednesday he was opposed to forming a ""backdoor government"" and that three parties from the former Pakatan Harapan ruling coalition had proposed his name to the king as candidate for prime minister.
""We wait for the decision of the king,"" he told a news conference."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A closely watched independence vote in the Pacific state of Chuuk, part of the U.S.-aligned Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), scheduled for next month has been postponed until 2022, the island told Reuters.
Chuuk's proximity to Guam, an American territory with air force and naval bases, and strategic location in the Pacific had raised the profile of the proposed vote amid expectations it would likely turn to China if became independent.
The island state, also known as Truk, is the most heavily populated of the four members that make up the FSM and has harbored independence aspirations amid discontent over how funding has been shared.
Chuuk State Attorney General Sabino Asor said in a statement to Reuters that Chuuk would give the FSM more time to ""correct some of the deficiencies"" by rescheduling the vote to March 2022.
""Let's please wait and see,"" said Asor, who is leading the pro-independence campaign.
The independence movement has been complicated by debate over the legal mechanisms Chuuk could use to leave the FSM, an independent country backed by U.S. financial and military agreements contained in what is called a Compact of Free Association.
It is the second time the vote has been postponed.
""The people of Chuuk and the people of the FSM are one and the same, and as Micronesians are committed to our national values of peace, unity, and liberty,"" the FSM government said in a statement to Reuters.
China has challenged U.S. influence in the Pacific in recent years by forging stronger economic ties with small island nations, and drawing countries out of their long-term alliances with Taiwan.
Though tiny in land mass, Pacific nations including the FSM control vast swaths of ocean, forming a boundary between the Americas and Asia.
Jian Zhang, associate professor at UNSW Canberra at the Australian Defence Force Academy, said Micronesian states were ideally located.
""It is in quite a strategic area, both close to U.S. bases, which could provide China an ability to monitor and deter military activity,"" Zhang told Reuters.
While the canceled vote will please U.S. interests, which have warned Chuuk against independence, the FSM is also subject to a wider diplomatic tug-of-war.
Parts of the agreement with the U.S. start expiring in 2023, raising the prospect that the island republic could shift its relationship towards Beijing, which has recently ramped up investment and diplomatic resources there.
In December, the FSM government disclosed details of at least $72 million worth of funding pledged by China for road construction, government building works and other projects after a state visit to Beijing by FSM President David Panuelo.
Four months earlier, Mike Pompeo became the first U.S. Secretary of State to visit the FSM.
""I'm pleased to announce the United States has begun negotiations on extending our compacts.... they sustain democracy in the face of Chinese efforts to redraw the Pacific,"" Pompeo told reporters at the time.

345,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 07:40PM ET</span>",Former Austrian far-right leader Strache runs again with splinter group,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The disgraced former leader of Austria's far-right Freedom Party (FPO), Heinz-Christian Strache, said on Wednesday he is running for office with a splinter party, a fresh blow to the FPO after Strache was ensnared in a sting that forced it out of government. 
The FPO expelled Strache in December after its support collapsed in September's parliamentary election over scandals including the video sting, in which Strache offered to fix government contracts at a dinner party in Ibiza with a woman posing as a Russian oligarch's niece.
Strache, who led the FPO for 14 years, has apologized for the ""massive mistake"" that led conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz to end his coalition with the FPO in May. Kurz is now back in government, this time with the Greens.
Prosecutors are investigating Strache on suspicion of fraud in connection with the sting footage. He denies committing any crimes.
""We are the original and not some gentlemen who swam along in my slipstream all these years. ... I stand ready to lead this citizens' movement with you,"" Strache said in a speech to supporters, touching on typical FPO themes like railing against illegal immigration and a recently introduced smoking ban.
Strache said he plans to run as the lead candidate in Vienna's provincial election this autumn for the Alliance for Austria (DAO), which was founded in December as a group within Vienna's regional assembly by Strache loyalists with FPO seats.
That means he is also running for mayor in ""Red Vienna"" a bastion of the Social Democrats (SPO), who have led the city and province for decades. When he led the FPO in the Vienna election in 2015 his party came second with roughly 31% to the SPO's 40%.
While Strache's image has been tarnished by the video sting scandal, he remains popular with many core FPO voters, suggesting he should be able to siphon some support from his former party in his hometown. 
Strache portrayed himself as the victim of political and judicial intrigue ahead of the election, which he hopes will provide his political rehabilitation.

""The more they attacked and persecuted me, the more the decision matured within me to step in the ring once again with you for the Austrian people,"" Strache said.

346,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 07:13PM ET</span>",Opponents of new London Heathrow runway to hear appeal outcome,"LONDON (Reuters) - Opponents of a third runway at London's Heathrow are set to hear on Thursday whether their legal appeal against the government's decision to expand Europe's biggest airport has been successful.
Britain has spent almost half a century trying to decide whether or where to build a new runway in the densely populated southeast of England. If finally opened, it will be the first full-length runway built in the London area for 70 years.
Last May, a High Court judge said he did not accept the arguments made by environmentalists and did not believe the government's transport minister had acted unlawfully when he approved the expansion of Europe's busiest airport.
Environmental groups, local authorities and the Mayor of London are appealing against that decision, arguing expansion is incompatible with Britain's climate change and environmental commitments.
In addition, development consortium Heathrow Hub is appealing on the grounds that the government should instead consider its proposals for an extended runway rather than a new one.
The Court of Appeal is due to deliver its verdict on Thursday. Any party can then seek permission to appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court, the highest court in Britain.
In 2018, lawmakers voted 415 to 119 in favor of building the new runway, but current Prime Minister Boris Johnson has historically been opposed to expansion.
During last year's election campaign, he said he would have to find some way of honoring an old promise to lie down in front of bulldozers at Heathrow to halt the expansion plans.
""Parliament has voted in principle to support a third runway at Heathrow but it is a private sector project,"" a spokesman for Johnson said.
""In order to proceed, Heathrow must demonstrate that it can meet its air-quality and noise obligations, that the project can be financed and built, and that the business case is realistic.""
Last December, the airport said the expansion plan would be delayed by more than a year after Britain's aviation regulator said it could not increase its spending on early construction costs to keep it on track. The third runway is now due for completion between early 2028 and late 2029.
The airport is jointly owned by Spain's Ferrovial, the Qatar Investment Authority, China Investment Corporation and other investment companies."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration can withhold millions of dollars in law enforcement funds from states and cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Wednesday.
The unanimous decision by a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan was a victory for Trump in his years-long fight with so-called sanctuary jurisdictions.
It overturned a lower court ruling directing the release of federal funds to New York City and the states of New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington.
The states and city sued over a 2017 policy conditioning receipt of the funds by state and local governments on their giving federal immigration officials access to their jails, and advance notice when immigrants in the country illegally are being released from custody.
Three federal appeals courts in Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco have upheld injunctions barring enforcement of at least some of the administration's conditions on the so-called Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants.
Wednesday's decision sets up a possible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which often resolves legal disputes that divide lower courts.
In the decision, Judge Reena Raggi said the case ""implicates several of the most divisive issues confronting our country"" including immigration policy and law enforcement, illegal immigrants, and the ability of state and local governments to adopt policies the federal government dislikes.
A U.S. Justice Department spokesman called the decision a ""major victory for Americans"" in recognizing Attorney General William Barr's authority to ensure that grant recipients do not thwart federal law enforcement priorities.
Trump, a Republican seeking re-election on Nov. 3, takes a hardline stance toward legal and illegal immigration.
His battle against Democratic-led ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions focuses on laws and policies making it harder for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to find and arrest immigrants they consider deportable.
The funding conditions announced by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions affected nearly $26 million of annual grants to the seven states and $4 million to New York City.
""It is part of the administration's campaign to coerce and bully state and local governments to adopt policies it prefers,"" said Cody Wofsy, a lawyer at the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, which filed a brief opposing the administration's conditions.
Wofsy called Wednesday's decision ""a major outlier,"" though state and municipalities could still ""opt out"" of contributing to federal immigration enforcement. 
The office of New York Attorney General Letitia James said it was reviewing the decision. New York City's law department had no immediate comment.
U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan in Nov. 2018 declared the conditions unconstitutional, saying the administration acted arbitrarily and capriciously in withholding grants without considering the impact on local law enforcement.
Raggi, however, said the conditions ""help the federal government enforce national immigration laws and policies supported by successive Democratic and Republican administrations.""
Byrne was a New York City police officer shot to death at age 22 in 1988 while guarding the home of a Guyanese immigrant helping authorities investigate drug trafficking.

The case is New York et al v U.S. Department of Justice et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 19-267, 19-275.

348,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>",Turkey will repel Syrian forces from Idlib posts this week: Erdogan,"By Nevzat Devranoglu and Tom Perry
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey plans to push Syrian government forces away from its military observation posts in northwest Syria's Idlib region this week, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday, despite advances by Damascus's Russian-backed military.
Nearly a million Syrians have been displaced in the last three months by fighting between Turkish-backed rebels and Syrian forces trying to recapture the last major insurgent-held region in Syria after nine years of war.
Ankara has sent thousands of troops and truckloads of equipment into the region, in Syria's northwest corner bordering Turkey, to support the rebels and Erdogan has vowed to push back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces.
""We are planning to liberate our observation posts from the surrounding (Syrian government forces) by the end of this month, one way or another,"" Erdogan told his party's lawmakers in a speech.
But Assad's forces made fresh gains in southern Idlib province where they took a number of villages on Wednesday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, and a military news outlet run by Assad's Lebanese ally Hezbollah.
The pro-government forces' immediate objective is to reach the town of Kafar Aweed, the capture of which would force rebels to withdraw from a wider tract of territory including their last remaining foothold in Hama province, Observatory Director Rami Abdulrahman said.
The Syrian army said it had seized numerous villages and towns in the last few days in the south of Idlib province, describing the captured territory as an important crossroads between rebel-held territories.
Early on Thursday, Turkey's Defense Ministry said two of its soldiers were killed and two others wounded in an air strike on Turkish forces in Idlib. Sixteen other Turkish soldiers have been killed in the region this month.
The ministry said the Turkish military opened fire on Syrian government targets in response. It said that according to various sources in the region 114 members of the Syrian forces were ""neutralized"".
Erdogan first demanded on Feb. 5 that Assad's forces pull back behind a line of Turkish observation posts by end-February, or Turkey would drive them back.
Turkey set up 12 observation posts up around a ""de-escalation zone"" in Idlib under a 2017 agreement with Russia and Iran, but several now find themselves behind Syrian government front lines.
Syrian insurgents backed by the Turkish military seized the town of Nairab in Idlib this week, according to rebel and Turkish sources, the first area to be taken back from advancing Syrian government forces.
WAVE OF MIGRANTS
Ankara is increasingly concerned about the build-up of displaced people south of its frontier with Syria. Turkey, which has already taken in 3.6 million Syrian refugees, says it cannot handle another influx and has closed the border.
Syrian government forces are advancing closer to the camps for uprooted people near the Turkish border, where the migrants fear being engulfed in the fighting.
Turkish and Russian officials began a third round of talks in Ankara on Wednesday aimed at reducing tensions in the region. Turkey's state-owned Anadolu news agency said the talks would continue on Thursday.
Two previous rounds in Ankara and Moscow have failed to yield any tangible progress.
Russia's Foreign Ministry expected positive results, RIA news agency cited Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov as saying, but a Turkish official was not optimistic.
""At the moment, solely military diplomacy is being carried out and it is not possible to solve the problem on the ground like this,"" the Turkish official told Reuters.
He said clear results were unlikely until a planned Turkey-Russia-Iran summit on March 6. A summit a day earlier between Russia, Turkey, France and Germany had been proposed, but Moscow has not sounded receptive to the idea.
Erdogan said in Wednesday's speech that he hoped the issue of using the air space over Idlib will be resolved soon. 

Russia controls the region's air space and has been bombing Turkish-supported rebels on a daily basis in support of the offensive by Syrian government forces.

SHANGHAI/SEOUL (Reuters) - The number of new coronavirus infections inside China - the source of the outbreak - was for the first time overtaken by fresh cases elsewhere on Wednesday, with Italy and Iran emerging as new epicenters of the rapidly spreading illness.
Asia reported hundreds of new cases, Brazil confirmed Latin America's first infection and the new disease - COVID-19 - was also detected for the first time in Pakistan, Sweden, Norway, Greece, Romania and Algeria.
U.S. health authorities, managing 59 cases so far - mostly Americans repatriated from a cruise ship in Japan - have said a global pandemic is likely.
President Donald Trump, who accused cable TV channels of exaggerating the danger and ""panicking markets,"" is set to hold a news conference on Wednesday evening, a likely attempt to reassure markets and the public about the government's coronavirus response. It will be one of just a handful of times that the president has appeared in the White House briefing room.
Stock markets across the world have lost $3.3 trillion of value in four days of trading, as measured by the MSCI all-country index (MIWD00000PUS). [MKTS/GLOB]
Wall Street reversed earlier gains on Wednesday afternoon and oil prices dropped to their lowest level in over a year, spooked in part by health officials saying dozens of people who had been in China were being monitored in suburbs of populous New York city - although no confirmed cases have been found.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio urged the federal government to tighten testing for visitors from a range of countries where the virus has been spreading, adding added that its eventual detection in the city was ""100% certain.""
The virus that can lead to pneumonia is believed to have originated in a market selling wildlife in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. It has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China.
While radical quarantining measures have helped slow the rate of transmission in China, it is accelerating elsewhere.
Germany, which has around 20 cases, said it was already impossible to trace all chains of infection, and Health Minister Jens Spahn urged regional authorities, hospitals and employers to review their pandemic planning.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said China had reported 412 new cases on Tuesday, while there were 459 in 37 other countries.
However, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus advised diplomats in Geneva on Wednesday against speaking of a pandemic - which the WHO defines as the worldwide spread of a new disease.
""Using the word pandemic carelessly has no tangible benefit, but it does have significant risk in terms of amplifying unnecessary and unjustified fear and stigma, and paralyzing systems,"" he said. ""It may also signal that we can no longer contain the virus, which is not true.""
The WHO says the outbreak peaked in China around Feb. 2, after measures that included isolating its epicenter Hubei province. It said only 10 new cases were reported in China on Tuesday outside Hubei.
FIRST LATIN AMERICAN CASE
Latin America's first case was in a 61-year-old man in Sao Paulo, Brazil, who had recently visited Italy, a new front line in the global outbreak.
The diagnosis coincided with the carnival holiday, a peak time for domestic travel. Brazil's stock index fell over 7%.
In addition to Brazil, Italians or people who recently visited Italy have tested positive in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Greece, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Italy itself has reported more than 400 cases, centered on the industrial heartlands of Lombardy and Veneto.
A hotel in Tenerife in Spain's Canary Islands was locked down over cases linked to Italy.
""It's very scary because everyone is out, in the pool, spreading the virus,"" said 45-year-old hotel guest Lara Pennington.
In France, a second person died - a teacher who had not visited any country with a known outbreak.
In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for sports and cultural events to be scrapped or curtailed for two weeks to stem the virus as concern mounted for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Japan has nearly 170 cases besides the 691 linked to the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined off its coast this month.
There have been nearly 50 deaths outside China, including 12 in Italy and 19 in Iran, according to a Reuters tally.
While Iran has reported only 139 cases, epidemiologists say the death rate of around 2% seen elsewhere suggest that the true number of cases must be many times higher.
Cases linked to Iran have been reported across the Middle East. Iraq imposed travel bans to affected countries and barred public gatherings.

As a result, people involved in putting combustible cladding on the tower as part of a redevelopment of the housing block will be able to give oral evidence to the inquiry without incriminating themselves. 
""The undertaking I am providing to the Inquiry means it can continue to take evidence from witnesses who otherwise would likely refuse to answer questions,"" Attorney General Suella Braverman said in a statement. 
""These questions are important to finding out the truth about the circumstances of the fire. The undertaking will not jeopardize the police investigation or prospects of a future criminal prosecution.""
The 23-storey tower, owned by the wealthy borough of Kensington and Chelsea, was destroyed in June 2017 in the worst fire in a residential building in Britain since World War Two.
The inquiry, which began in September 2017, has established that a flammable cladding system fitted to Grenfell Tower's external walls during a refurbishment was the main factor in the unstoppable spread of the fire.
Contractors involved in the refurbishment had been due to start testifying earlier this month but that was postponed after some of them made a request for a guarantee that nothing they told the inquiry could be used to prosecute them.
The government said that while the undertaking meant oral evidence couldn't be used against individuals in criminal proceedings, it didn't prevent the evidence being used against corporations in a future prosecution.
However, Grenfell United, a group which represents the bereaved and survivors of the fire, said that the decision made them ""nervous"".
""Truth at the inquiry must not come at the expense of justice and prosecutions. For our continued participation, the government must make sure the inquiry process does not undermine prosecutions,"" the group said in a statement.

""Grenfell was a tragedy but it was not an accident. The people responsible for knowingly encasing our families in a death trap and the people that allowed them to do it must face the full force of the law. We expect criminal prosecutions at the end of this and will not settle for anything less.""

HAVANA (Reuters) - One of Communist-run Cuba's leading dissidents, Jose Daniel Ferrer, was due to go on trial on Wednesday on charges of abducting and assaulting a man, his supporters said, in a controversial case that is being closely watched worldwide.
The Cuban government has not confirmed that Ferrer was going on trial, but it has confirmed that he was arrested and is in jail. European officials, Amnesty International and the U.S. Embassy in Havana have said they will be watching the trial.
Ferrer, 49, is the leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), one of the country's largest and most active opposition groups. The government calls him a U.S.-financed counterrevolutionary but said he was not jailed for his political views. It accused him instead of being a violent common criminal who kidnapped a man and caused him serious injuries last September. 
Supporters of Ferrer, who was arrested last Oct. 1, say the charges are false and merely an attempt to silence a vocal critic. They say the trial - which foreign media have not been invited to cover - is a sham.
The case has garnered international attention, with global rights organizations, the European Parliament and the U.S. government calling for Ferrer's release.
""It cannot be a crime to criticize policies that have set Cuba’s development tumbling backwards for the past 61 years,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote in an open letter to his Cuban counterpart Bruno Rodriguez on Monday. 
Cuban official media on Wednesday did not mention the trial, which Ferrer's supporters say is taking place in his hometown Santiago de Cuba, around 500 miles east of Havana.
The lawyer assigned to the activist by the state informed Ferrer's wife Nelva Ortega late on Tuesday that the trial would start on Wednesday at 0830, according to Ferrer's sister Ana Belkis Ferrer. Ortega could not immediately be reached for comment.
Ferrer's sister, who lives in the United States, told Reuters she had been keeping in touch with Ortega and UNPACU members by phone, but their lines appeared to have been cut on Wednesday.
""Very early in the morning, they told me the courthouse had been besieged by security agents,"" she said.
Ferrer was one of 75 dissidents arrested in 2003 during a nationwide crackdown known as the Black Spring. He was released on parole in 2011 and soon after formed UNPACU.
In recent years, it had become unusual for the authorities to arrest a prominent dissident figure for more than a week, although they continued to regularly detain rights activists for a few hours or days.
Ferrer's case underscores an increase in repression of late, government critics say, likely related to increased U.S. hostility under President Donald Trump and deepening of Cuba's economic problems.

Cuba and its arch-nemisis the United States had undergone a detente in 2014-2016 during the administration former U.S. President Barack Obama.

Varadkar said he still planned to lead Fine Gael into opposition when a government is eventually formed, though he has said in the past that it would consider helping to form a government if other alternatives were exhausted.
Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and the left-wing Sinn Fein nationalists each secured just under a quarter of the 160 seats in the Irish parliament in this month's election, and two of the three will need to cooperate to form a government.
Both Fianna Fail, on 37 seats, and Fine Gael, on 35, have ruled out sharing power with Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army, with its 37 seats.
This leaves some form of cooperation between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, perhaps with the help of the Green Party's 12 legislators - or another election.
""The Taoiseach (prime minister) said he does not believe there is currently sufficient basis for appointing a negotiating team or initiating discussions on a potential program for government,"" Fine Gael parliamentary chairman Martin Heydon said in a statement after the meeting.
Heydon did, however, say Fine Gael had agreed to hold a one-day policy exchange with Fianna Fail next week on a number of common policy themes, and would hold similar talks with the Green Party.
Varadkar and Fianna Fail's leader Micheal Martin held preliminary talks on Tuesday and said they would meet again in a bid to break the deadlock.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday Bernie Sanders was wrong to call him a racist during a debate among contenders for the U.S. Democratic presidential nomination, but shied away from attacking the senator in return.
""I am not intervening in the U.S. election,"" Netanyahu replied when asked on Israeli Army Radio about what an interviewer termed Sanders' personal attack on him at Tuesday's event in Charleston, South Carolina.
Sanders, who has been critical of the right-wing leader's policy toward Palestinians, described Netanyahu as ""a reactionary racist who is now running"" Israel.
Pressed further for his thoughts about Sanders, who if elected would be the first Jewish president in U.S. history, Netanyahu said: ""What I think about this matter is that he is definitely wrong. No question about it.""
Asked about possible confrontation with Sanders should the self-described democratic socialist win the White House, Netanyahu said that as prime minister he had stood up to U.S. presidential opposition to his policies before and would be able to do so again.
Netanyahu had a contentious relationship with Barack Obama, Republican Donald Trump's predecessor as president, with the Iranian nuclear deal and Israel's settlement policy in the occupied West Bank main areas of friction.
Israel's longest-serving leader, Netanyahu is fighting for his political survival in a national election on Monday, the country's third in less than a year after inconclusive ballots in April and September.
During the campaign, Netanyahu has steered clear of commenting directly on the U.S. election. 
But he has praised Trump as the best friend Israel has ever had in the White House, noting the president's decisions to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the U.S. embassy to the city. 
Netanyahu has also tried to play on many Israelis' suspicions about the loyalty of Israel's 21 percent Arab minority, political analysts say. 
The right-wing Likud party leader says his main challenger, former general Benny Gantz, would need the support of an Arab party to form a governing coalition, effectively tying his hands in pursuing any military action in the region.
The tactic forced Gantz to deny that a government led by his centrist Blue and White party would rely on the Joint List, an Arab coalition mostly supported by descendants of Palestinians who lived in what became Israel after its creation in 1948.
Israel's Arab community has long accused Netanyahu, in power from 1996-1999 and since 2009, of fear-mongering. On election day in 2015 Netanyahu urged his voters to turn out, warning that Arabs were flocking to the polls ""in droves.""

Netanyahu, who held a campaign rally in an Arab town on Wednesday, has said he has no dispute with the Arab public in general, only with Arab politicians pursuing policies he opposes.

Violence against so-called ""social leaders"" has become a top issue for the government of President Ivan Duque, who has faced frequent criticism from the international community, non-governmental organizations and human rights activists for not doing enough to stop the killings.
Last year, 108 human rights defenders of all genders were killed, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights told journalists, while a further 10 cases were still being verified.
Fifteen of the activists murdered were women.
""We are alarmed that in 2019 the killings of women human rights defenders increased close to 50%,"" said Alberto Brunori, the U.N.'s human rights chief in Colombia.
""The quick and effective implementation of a comprehensive program of guarantees for women leaders and women human rights defenders could be an important tool for prevention and protection against murders and attacks,"" he added.
The number of activist killings has fallen overall since Duque took office in August 2018, the center-right president told journalists at a breakfast event on Wednesday. 
""There is a reduction, but the figure should be zero,"" said Duque. He blamed the killings on Marxist-led National Liberation Army rebels, dissidents from the FARC rebel movement who reject a 2016 peace deal, and criminal gangs involved in drug trafficking and illegal mining.
There were 36 massacres - defined as the killing of more than four people - in Colombia last year, the highest figure in the last five years, the U.N. rights office said.
Fifteen people died in police or army operations involving presumed arbitrary detentions, the U.N. added.

A total of 115 activists were killed in Colombia in 2018.

No further information was immediately available on the previous movements of the 38-year-old woman, though Greek media said she had returned to Greece from Milan by air on Feb. 23.
Greece has not introduced any travel restrictions to Italy, which is the country in Europe most affected by the outbreak with more than 370 cases and 12 deaths reported.
""She is in good health and is being monitored by a team of exceptional colleagues in Thessaloniki,"" health ministry representative Sotiris Tsiodras told a news briefing.
Authorities are in the process of identifying people the woman has come into contact with, he said, adding that those who have been in close proximity would be placed in isolation.
A health ministry official said 10-15 people the patient had been in touch with had already been quarantined.
""We are tracing the people who came in contact with her. Also the airline and, as protocol says, with passengers who were at a specified proximity and crew members,"" Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias told reporters.
He also canceled all leave for staff at his ministry and at all state-run hospitals nationwide until further notice.
The Health and Education ministries ordered the ""precautionary"" closing of one school in Thessaloniki, where the woman is hospitalized, for a day, without providing further details.
Coronavirus is believed to have originated in a market selling wildlife in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China.
It causes respiratory symptoms similar to a cold or flu and like other respiratory infections, it spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes.
On Tuesday, authorities in Athens unveiled a contingency plan which includes school closures, bans on public gatherings and suspension of all means of public transport in the event of a health emergency.
""The first case of coronovirus has been confirmed in our country. It was something we expected and we are absolutely prepared,"" Kikilias said.
Greece, which has 11 million people but attracts more than 30 million foreign tourists annually, has identified 13 hospitals across the country for treating infected patients."

TIRANA (Reuters) - Nexhmije Hoxha, the widow of Albania's Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha, died on Tuesday aged 99, her son said, having fallen dramatically from grace following his death but remaining the staunchest defender of his isolationist regime.
Most Albanians view Hoxha's 40-year rule, when the country was cut off from the world much as North Korea is now and a pervasive secret police clamped down violently on dissent, as a dark period in its history that caused widespread misery and triggered a massive exodus after communism collapsed.
But Nexhmije Hoxha, who was jailed for nine years for embezzlement soon after Albania became the last country to topple communism in 1990, stayed loyal to his memory.
""When the standard of living was compared to the West, it can be considered modest, but there was an egalitarian spirit,"" she said in a 2008 interview.
Enver Hoxha, who died in 1985, banned private property and religion, ran a centralized economy, sealed off the country's borders and dotted it with thousands of pillbox bunkers and millions of concrete posts topped with sharp spikes to deter the airbourne troops he feared would invade.
He allied with the Soviet Union and China only to split with them later while remaining an enemy of the West.
His wife died in her house in a bleak compound that was once used to rear battery chickens, surrounded by books and photos of her husband, children and grandchildren she had taken with her when she was evicted from their sprawling Communist-era villa.
She led his propaganda machine, a Marxism and Leninism institute and the Democratic Front, an umbrella organization that served as a tool of Communist Party control.
""The goal of my trial was political because I was the widow of Enver Hoxha,"" she said, telling Reuters her conviction related to a sum of $360 spent on cups and glasses broken when mourners visited to pay condolences for her husband.
She said she did not recognize the streets when she came out of jail and admitted some things had improved since 1990.
She had recently published a book of memoirs that a representative of the association of former political prisoners jailed by Hoxha's regime described as hate-filled.
""An executioner has departed Albanian society, who was ...condemned ... for spending money on coffee. A charade of postcommunist governments chose not to punish her (real) crimes,"" Besim Ndregjoni told broadcaster News24 TV.
More than 6,000 people were executed as opponents of the regime under Enver Hoxha's rule and more than 34,000 jailed, of whom around 1,000 died, while 59,009 were sent into internal exile, the association estimates."

Britain has so far had 13 cases of people testing positive for infection with the new coronavirus. An outbreak in northern Italy worsened on Wednesday, and the epidemic has spread to Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Croatia and France via visitors who were recently in northern Italy.
""We're heightening our vigilance because of the apparent spread of the virus in countries outside mainland China,"" Public Health England's medical director, Paul Cosford, told BBC radio. 
The virus is believed to have originated in a market selling wildlife in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China.
British Health Minister Matt Hancock said the government had plans in place in case the coronavirus disease outbreak becomes a pandemic. 
In Britain, random tests for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, will be carried out at 11 hospitals and 100 general medical offices on people who have flu-like symptoms including a cough, plus shortness of breath and a fever. 
""This testing will tell us whether there's evidence of infection more widespread than we think"" PHE's Cosford said. 
""The other thing it will do is, if we do get to the position of more widespread infection across the country, then it will give us early warning that that's happening,"" he said.
Hancock told parliament the government expected more cases in Britain. ""We are taking all necessary measures to minimise the risk,"" he said. ""The public can be assured that we have a clear plan to contain, delay, research and mitigate this virus.""
Media have reported several schools have closed or sent pupils home after returning from trips to northern Italy during last week's school holiday. Hancock said there was no need for schools to close or other students or staff to be sent home. 
Bharat Pankhania, an expert at the University of Exeter Medical School agreed: ""There’s no need for a school to close,"" he said. ""It's disproportionate, and it gives the wrong impression. It makes people extremely concerned when there’s no need to be.""

358,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>",A mob out for blood: India's protests pit Hindus against Muslims,"By Danish Siddiqui and Devjyot Ghoshal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Mohammad Zubair was on his way home from a local mosque in northeast New Delhi when he came across a large crowd. He turned toward an underpass to avoid the commotion; it proved to be a mistake.
Within seconds, he was cowering on the ground surrounded by more than a dozen young men, who began beating him with wooden sticks and metal rods. Blood flowed from his head, spattering his clothes. The blows intensified. He thought he would die.
Zubair provided his version of events at a relative's home in another part of the capital, his head wrapped in bandages. 
The mid-afternoon attack on Monday, captured in a dramatic Reuters photograph, came against a backdrop of tension and violence.
Near the area of the Indian capital where it occurred, Muslim and Hindu protesters had been fighting pitched battles for hours across a concrete and metal barrier that divided the main thoroughfare, throwing rocks and primitive petrol bombs.
But the sight of a mob screaming pro-Hindu slogans suddenly turning on an unarmed individual, apparently because he was a Muslim, was a sign that growing tensions between members of India's two dominant religions may be hard to contain.
Unrest across India began in December with the passing of a law that makes non-Muslims from some neighboring nations eligible for fast-tracked citizenship - a move many Muslims say is discriminatory and marks a break from India's secular traditions.
Persecuted religious minorities including from Hindu, Sikh, or Christian communities are eligible for citizenship, but those from Islam do not enjoy all the same advantages.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) says the new citizenship law is necessary to protect persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, and denies any bias against India's Muslims.
""They saw I was alone, they saw my cap, beard, shalwar kameez (clothes) and saw me as a Muslim,"" Zubair told Reuters. ""They just started attacking, shouting slogans. What kind of humanity is this?""
""EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE""
BJP spokesman Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga said his party did not support any kind of violence, including the attack on Zubair. He blamed rival parties for stoking the chaos during U.S. President Donald Trump's visit in order to damage India's image.
""This was 100 percent pre-planned,"" he said of the violence, adding that his party or its policies had nothing to do with the chaos. Reuters has no independent evidence that the protests were planned in advance.
Bagga said that the federal government, which controls Delhi police, moved to deploy paramilitary forces in order to bring the situation under control.
""I believe within 24 hours everything will be fine,"" he added.
Delhi police were not immediately available for comment on the attack on Zubair.
Since cruising back to power in May, Modi has pursued a Hindu-first agenda that has emboldened his followers, who account for about 80 percent of the population, and left India's 180 million Muslims reeling.
Now opponents and supporters of the law, largely divided between Muslims and Hindus, are facing off against each other. Some say the polarization evokes a dark chapter in India's past.
""The violence is now happening in tiny pockets of Delhi and reminds you of the beginning of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots,"" said Yogendra Yadav, a political scientist who leads a small political party opposed to the BJP.
He was referring to mob attacks on the Sikh minority after members of the community assassinated then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Thousands of Sikhs were killed in cities including Delhi in what Indian investigators said was organized violence.
APPEAL FOR CALM
Modi appealed for calm on Wednesday after at least 20 people were killed and more than 200 injured in some of the worst sectarian violence in New Delhi in decades. [nL3N2AQ12X]
The citizenship law behind the unrest is one of several steps taken by Modi's government since its re-election that have appealed to the Hindu majority.
In August, it stripped Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, of its special status, a move which Modi defended as a way of integrating the region with the rest of the country.
In November, the Supreme Court handed Hindu groups control of a contested site in the city of Ayodhya that paves the way for a temple to be built on a site where a mosque once stood. That was a central election promise made by the BJP.
Modi's position as chief minister of Gujarat state during some of the worst riots in India's independent history that took place there in 2002 has long stoked mistrust among some Muslims.
Up to 2,500 people, mostly Muslims, were killed during riots sparked after 59 Hindu pilgrims were burned to death when their train was set alight by suspected Muslims.
In the subsequent investigation, Modi was absolved of wrongdoing, even as dozens of people on both sides of the riots were convicted.
""REMEMBERING MY ALLAH""
    Before this week's clashes in New Delhi, 25 people had been killed in running battles between protesters and police across the country.
    That number has now nearly doubled after two days of arson, lootings, beatings and shootings in parts of northeastern New Delhi that police forces have struggled to contain.
    Delhi police said in a statement late on Tuesday that they were making every effort to contain the clashes and urged people to maintain the peace.
    Witnesses said police and paramilitary forces were patrolling the streets in far greater numbers on Wednesday. Parts of the riot-hit areas were deserted.
    Several of those killed and injured had been shot, according to two medics at the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, where many of the victims were taken. Reuters could not determine who had fired on them.
    Among them, Yatinder Vikal, a 33-year-old Hindu, was brought in with a gunshot wound to his right knee. His brother said Yatinder was driving a scooter when a bullet hit him.
    Reuters witnesses at a local hospital spoke to both Hindu and Muslim victims who were injured in the violence.
An unconscious Zubair was eventually dragged to safety by fellow Muslims who came to his aid after throwing stones to disperse his attackers.
    The 37-year-old, who makes a living doing odd jobs, was rushed to hospital where he was treated for wounds to his head and released late on Monday.

   ""I was thinking 'I'm not going to survive this',"" he recalled. ""I was remembering my Allah.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Julian Assange complained he was struggling to follow his extradition hearing on Wednesday as his legal team argued Britain should not send him to the United States because the charges against him were politically motivated.
Assange, 48, faces 18 counts in the U.S. including conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law for publishing thousands of classified diplomatic cables. He faces decades in prison if convicted.
But the Wikileaks founder complained he was struggling to hear proceedings from his position in the dock at Woolwich Crown Court and asked to be able to sit with his lawyers.
""I am as much a participant in these proceedings as I am at Wimbledon (tennis),"" he told the judge. ""I cannot communicate with my lawyers or ask them for clarifications.""
On the third day of the hearing, Assange said he was also unable to communicate privately with his lawyers because of microphones in the dock and unnamed U.S. embassy officials in the courtroom.
Assange's legal team will submit a formal application for him to leave the dock on Thursday after judge Vanessa Baraitser said such a move was not a risk assessment she could make and questioned whether he would still technically be in custody if allowed out of the dock.
She said most defendants normally sit in the dock and that she could not make exceptions but she did however ask Assange's legal team to make a formal application that he should be able to move.
James Lewis, for the U.S. government, said he would not object if Assange were allowed to sit in the well of the court handcuffed to a security official. 
""POLITICAL CHARGES""
Earlier, Assange's lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald, said extradition for political offences was not allowed under the Anglo-US Extraditions Treaty set up in 2003.
Violent crimes and terrorism were the only type of political crimes that the treaty allows people to be extradited for, he said.
His legal team compared Assange to the British Iraq war whistleblower Katharine Gun and Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish artillery officer in the French army who in 1894 was convicted of treason and shipped to a penal colony off South America’s Atlantic coast.
Fitzgerald also argued that the court needed to consider various protections enshrined in both international law and the European Convention of Human Rights.
But Lewis for the U.S. disagreed with the claim that espionage is a political offense.
He said earlier this week that Assange had put lives at risk by disseminating classified materials through Wikileaks.

The United States asked Britain to extradite Assange last year after he was pulled from the Ecuador embassy in London, where he had spent seven years holed up to avoid being sent to Sweden over sex crime allegations which have since been dropped.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed for peace in Delhi on Wednesday after days of Hindu-Muslim clashes over a disputed new citizenship law sparked some of the worst sectarian violence seen in the capital in decades.
At least 24 people were killed and hundreds more wounded in the riots, according to hospital officials, with many suffering gunshot wounds, amid incidents of stone-pelting, arson and looting that coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump's first visit to India.
Police and paramilitary forces patrolled the streets in far greater numbers on Wednesday, and swathes of the riot-hit areas were deserted. 
""Peace and harmony are central to our ethos. I appeal to my sisters and brothers of Delhi to maintain peace and brotherhood at all times,"" Modi said in a tweet. 
Modi's appeal came after criticism from opposition parties over the government's failure to control the violence, despite the use of tear gas, pellets and smoke grenades.
Sonia Gandhi, president of the opposition Congress party, called for the resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah, who is directly responsible for law and order in the capital. 
The violence erupted between thousands demonstrating for and against the new legislation passed by Modi's Hindu nationalist government. 
The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) makes it easier for non-Muslims from some neighboring Muslim-dominated countries to gain Indian citizenship.
Critics say the law is biased against Muslims and undermines India's secular constitution. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party has denied having any bias against India's 180 million plus Muslims.
On Wednesday, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) said it was alarmed by the violence and it urged the Indian government ""to rein in mobs and protect religious minorities and others who have been targeted"". 
Separately, the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi urged its citizens on Wednesday to be cautious following disturbances. 
Reuters witnesses saw mobs wielding sticks and pipes walking down streets in parts of northeast Delhi on Tuesday, amid arson attacks and pillaging. Thick clouds of black smoke billowed from a tire market that was set ablaze.
In northeast Delhi's Brijpuri district, where Hindus and Muslims live in densely-packed houses separated by narrow lanes, parts of a mosque lay charred and an adjoining anti-government protest site lay in rubble and burnt. 
A first-aid post near the mosque stood smashed to bits, and the inside of the mosque was scorched, with melted fans hanging from the ceiling and molten prayer mats fused to the floor.
""The police should have protected both sides, but they only helped one side,"" local resident Mohammad Arif said.
Both sides appeared involved in the violence, however, and there were both Hindu and Muslim victims being treated for injuries in a local hospital. 
At Arun Modern Public School, a few houses down from the mosque, entire classrooms were burnt and on the street outside, desks pulled out from classrooms lay strewn on the road.
""A Muslim mob of several hundred broke in and ransacked the school,"" said Pawan Kumar, a guard at the school. 
A nearby building owned by a Hindu was still smoldering. 
""If the police hadn't come, we wouldn't have survived,"" said Sudama, a Hindu resident.

ATMEH, Syria (Reuters) - When Hassan Mighlaj's family ran from the bombs battering their village in northwest Syria, they came up against a wall: an imposing gray concrete wall, crowned with barbed wire and spanning the border with Turkey to block their way in. 
So Mighlaj is building a small hut with cement blocs along the wall for shelter. ""We have nowhere left but the wall because there's no space. And I want my children to stay close to me,"" the 45-year-old construction worker told Reuters.
The wall, three meters high, has become part of daily life for families like Mighlaj's who escaped an army offensive in northwest Syria to take refuge near the border.
Nearly a million people have fled fighting in the Idlib region over the last three months, the biggest exodus of Syria's nine-year war. 
Stuck at the closed-off Turkish border, some have made their new homes along the wall. Families use it to prop up tarpaulin tents or build makeshift shelters. People hang clothes to dry on the wall. Boys play a game of trying to climb it and one man has put up a fence at the wall to plant onions. 
But the barrier is a symbol of how people who fled President Bashar al-Assad have no place left to go as Syrian troops, with Russian backing, gain ground in the country's last major rebel stronghold.
There was no room for Mighlaj's wife and children nearby in the Atmeh camp, where blue and white tents stretch out across the town, already overflowing with Syrians uprooted by other battles earlier in the war.
If the army marches toward the border, he says he will be the first to cross the wall, even if it kills him. ""There's no doubt. I have children. There's no other option, dead or alive.""
Behind the wall are watchtowers and fortified fences in a zone patrolled by soldiers around the clock.
""Today people are seeking shelter at the Turkish wall, this wall that was set up to keep us out,"" said Abu Sham, 25, who fled his village in Idlib.
He tried to get as far away from the frontlines as possible.

""If I went elsewhere, the regime would advance there too. Now we're at the last point at the wall,"" he said. If fighting reaches the border, ""people will either get slaughtered here or we will go into Turkey, one way or another.""

The troupe has also apologized to the Jewish community in Spain over the parade in the small town of Campo de Criptana about 110 km (68 miles) southeast of Madrid.
In the parade, some dancers wore Nazi uniforms and had machine guns, others wore striped death camp costumes, and girls in white paraded with Israeli flags.

The embassy in Madrid had condemned the ""vile and appalling show"" in a tweet, saying it ""mocks the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis"".
""We have apologized for possible grievances that may have been caused,"" said the group's spokesman, Carlos Jimenez, adding that it had closed down its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page after receiving threats and insults.

ROME (Reuters) - Pope Francis led the world's 1.3 billion Roman Catholics into the penitential season of Lent, reminding them on Ash Wednesday that everyone will be ""dust in the universe"" regardless of their status on earth.
The pope presided at a traditional service leading a procession between two churches on the streets of Rome and saying Mass, opening the 40-day season that leads to Easter.
Cardinal Jozef Tomko, 95, rubbed ashes on the pontiff's head and then Francis rubbed them on the heads of others, in an age-old ritual to remind people of their mortality.
""The dust sprinkled on our heads brings us back to earth; it reminds us that we are dust and to dust we shall return. We are weak, frail and mortal,"" he said in his sermon.
""Centuries and millennia pass and we come and go; before the immensity of galaxies and space, we are nothing. We are dust in the universe,"" he said.
During Lent, which is marked by repentance, fasting and reflection, the faithful are also called on to practice more good deeds, such as alms giving, and to be particularly close to the needy and the suffering.
""All around us, we see the dust of death. Lives reduced to ashes. Rubble, destruction, war. The lives of unwelcomed innocents, the lives of the excluded poor, the lives of the abandoned elderly,"" he said.
During Lent, Catholics are called on to give up something, such as sweets.
Earlier on Wednesday, at his general audience in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ), Francis added a modern twist to the list of things to quit during the season and beyond: insulting people on social media.
Some Ash Wednesday services were canceled or limited in areas of northern Italy hit by the spread of coronavirus.
Five days after the first case was confirmed in northern Italy, more than 300 new infected people were reported, mostly in the regions of Lombardy and Veneto, 12 people have died and accusations are mounting that the emergency has been mishandled.
A number of people wore masks in St. Peter's Square at the Wednesday audience but only one person was seen wearing one at the pope's Ash Wednesday service."

OSLO (Reuters) - Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, pro-democracy campaigners in Hong Kong and the NATO military alliance are among those tipped for the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize, following nominations by politicians.
Also on the list, according to the eight members of the United States Congress who nominated her, is imprisoned Saudi women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul.
Norway's Nobel Institute, which does not confirm or deny the names of any particular individuals or organizations nominated, said on Wednesday it had received nominations for 317 candidates this year, up from 301 in 2019. Of these 210 were individuals and 107 were organizations. 
It will announce the winner in October. 
Thousands of people who can make nominations, including members of national parliaments, former laureates and leading academics, often announce whose names they have forwarded.
The outcome is decided each year by a committee of five people appointed by Norway's parliament.
Thunberg, 17, famous for launching her School Strike for the Climate campaign that has spread around much of the world, is the bookmakers' favorite to win, according to betting firm Paddypower. 
Although nominated last year, the 2019 prize went to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for his peacemaking efforts which ended two decades of hostility with longtime enemy Eritrea.
The Swede would be the second youngest person to win a Nobel, beaten only by Malala Yousafzai, who was a few months younger at the time of her 2014 award for promoting children's right to education.
The two activists were pictured together this week at Britain's University of Oxford, where Malala, as she is best known, is a student.
While Thunberg's name was put forward by two Swedish parliamentarians, three members of the Norwegian parliament have suggested that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - the military alliance that last year marked its 75th anniversary - should be given the award.
In January, members of Congress led by Oregon Democrat Suzanne Bonamici nominated Loujain al-Hathloul, whom rights groups have said was held in solitary confinement for months and subjected to abuse including electric shocks, flogging, and sexual assault.
""Ms. al-Hathloul is deserving of the Committee's recognition in 2020 because she embodies the peaceful struggle for equal right of women in Saudi Arabia,"" Bonamici and seven other members of Congress wrote in a letter and published online. 
Norwegian Liberal Party MP Guri Melby meanwhile said she had nominated ""the people of Hong Kong"" for fighting for freedom of speech, democracy and the rule of law, which would be certain to provoke a sharp reaction from China if an award was ever made.
The award in 2010 of the Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo resulted in a six-year standoff between Norway and China, during which diplomatic ties were virtually frozen.

Liu, who had called for sweeping political reforms, died in 2017 while serving a lengthy prison term.

Finnegan Lee Elder, 20, is accused of killing the policeman in central Rome on July 26 in an incident that shocked Italians.
Elder and fellow student Gabriel Christian Natale-Hjorth, were arrested on suspicion of murdering Mario Cerciello Rega after the policeman intervened in a dispute that began over a drug deal involving the pair, police said at the time.
The defendants, both from San Francisco, have been in prison in Rome since their arrest. 
Franco Coppi, the lawyer for Cerciello Rega's family, told Reuters he had asked for an adjournment ""because some institutions want to be included as plaintiffs in the trial"". He did not elaborate.
Wednesday's proceedings would be limited to admission of evidence and setting a timetable for future hearings, Coppi said.
Police say Cerciello Rega, unarmed and in plain clothes, was stabbed by Elder 11 times with an 18-cm (7-inch) blade as he was trying to arrest him and Natale-Hjorth on suspicion of stealing a backpack.

Another officer at the scene, Andrea Varriale, was allegedly injured in the incident by Natale-Hjorth, after the pair stole the backpack from a drug-dealer who they believed had cheated them, according to the version of the police.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian government test has confirmed the first case of a fast-spreading new coronavirus in Latin America, a source said on Wednesday, after a Sao Paulo hospital flagged the possible infection of a 61-year-old who had visited Italy.
The diagnosis comes during Brazil's carnival holiday, a peak time for domestic travel when millions of revelers throng to major cities for raucous street celebrations.
Brazil's Health Ministry declined to comment on the result of the test ahead of a news conference around 11 a.m. local time (1400 GMT). The person familiar with the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because the results were not yet public.
The ministry said in a statement on Tuesday evening it was looking into the case of a Sao Paulo resident who had traveled to Lombardy, in northern Italy, from Feb. 9 to Feb. 21 and had symptoms compatible with the disease.
Italy has been hardest hit by the outbreak in Europe, with more than 350 cases reported and 11 deaths.
The Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo said that the man tested positive to a PCR real time test on Monday and it notified Sao Paulo state's epidemiological agency on Tuesday.
He remains in good health and will be monitored in isolation for the next 14 days, the hospital said in a written statement.
Brazilian sanitary agency Anvisa said it had requested a list of the passengers on his same flight from Italy to Brazil.
Although the case in Sao Paulo is the first in Brazil to be confirmed as the new coronavirus, the country has been tracking suspected cases as travelers return from Asia and Europe.
The latest suspected case appeared in the northeastern state of Pernambuco, where a 51-year-old woman arrived this week from Italy with mild flu symptoms, according to the state health secretariat.
The new coronavirus is believed to have originated in a market selling wildlife in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China.
Concerns over the economic impact of the disease have wiped out more than $3 trillion of value on tumbling stock markets over the past four trading sessions.
Brazil's stock market, which has been closed since last week due to the carnival holiday, is set to open at 1 p.m. local time on Wednesday. Brazilian shares in exchange-traded funds in New York have dropped nearly 6% this week."

Guineans vote on Sunday in a referendum on constitutional reforms that could allow Conde to stand again, and the prospect of him staying longer in office has already led to months of sometimes violent protests.
His opponents believe that Conde, who became Guinea's first democratically elected leader in 2010, is becoming increasingly authoritarian and will follow other African leaders who have extended their rule through political machinations.
Conde told le Figaro newspaper that the 2010 constitution was bad and needed modernizing.
""The Guinean people will ask this question: Is it the first time that a president changes the constitution to do a third or fourth term? Why would it be impossible in Guinea to do three mandates?"" he said in an interview published on Wednesday.
In some other African countries, leaders have used a constitution change as an excuse to reset their term limits.
""It's only Guinea that is criticized. Some countries can change constitution four or five times without being criticized,"" Conde said, using Chadian President Idriss Deby as an example.
Western and Chinese businesses are also keeping an eye on how events unfold.
The West African nation is rich with natural resources including the world's largest bauxite reserves, gold, diamond and iron ore.
But investments have stalled due to political instability and a lack of infrastructure and most of its 13 million people live in poverty.
Conde's first election victory in 2010 raised hopes for democratic progress in the former French colony after two years of military rule and nearly a quarter of a century under authoritarian President Lansana Conte, who died in 2008.
But Conde's critics accuse him of cracking down on dissent and violently repressing protests - charges he denies. He asked his government last year to draft a new constitution that would permit him to run for office again.
The Paris-based group of French-speaking countries, the Organisation internationale de la Francophone, which had been due to monitor Sunday's vote, has suspended its support of the ballot.
It questioned the credibility of the vote due to 2.49 million ""problematic"" entries on the electoral register.
It also called on Guinean authorities ""to act quickly to avoid any further loss of human life and to stop any risk of escalation toward violence"".
Conde said he was surprised by the organization's reaction and accused the opposition of calling for violence and hiring young people to throw stones.
""We will do everything to keep the calm and ensure the population can vote,"" Conde said."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - ""Bibi or Tibi"" is the election slogan hammered home at nearly every opportunity on the campaign trail by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Rhyming, pithy and playing on Netanyahu's nickname, the slogan targeting Arab politician Ahmad Tibi seems a puzzling choice for a right-wing leader whose main rival in Monday's election is not Tibi but Benny Gantz, a former Israeli general.
But Israeli political analysts say there is method to Netanyahu's tactics in an election that opinion polls suggest could be as close as two inconclusive ballots last year that failed to produce a governing coalition.
They say that by framing the election as a choice between himself and an Arab-Israeli parliamentarian that Gantz might have to look to for support during coalition talks, Netanyahu hopes to fire up his right-wing base, many of whom harbor suspicions of Israel's 21-percent Arab minority.
""Gantz cannot create a government without Ahmad Tibi, this is the secret of these elections,"" Netanyahu, 70, told a rally in Or Yehuda on Feb. 13.
""Ahmad Tibi says don't operate in Gaza, Gantz will not be able to operate in Gaza,"" he said, referring to the self-ruled Palestinian territory. ""Ahmad Tibi will tell him not to operate against Iran in Syria, Gantz will not be able to operate.""
And for those Israelis who have tuned out the campaign chatter, Netanyahu's Likud party has driven the message home with posters showing a caricatured Gantz riding on Tibi's back.
The tactic forced Gantz to deny that a government led by his centrist Blue and White party would rely on the Joint List, an Arab coalition mostly supported by descendants of Palestinians who lived in what became Israel after its creation in 1948.
Tibi, a physician, says Likud's ""obsession"" with him ""can be diagnosed as Tibi-phobia"".
""He is focusing on Ahmad Tibi, Ahmad the Arab, trying to incite his (right-wing) base, Jewish base, saying: 'Look, the Arabs are controlling the government',"" Tibi, 61, told Reuters at his East Jerusalem home.
'FLOCKING TO THE POLLS'
Israel's Arab minority has long accused Netanyahu, in power from 1996-1999 and since 2009, of fear-mongering. On election day in 2015 Netanyahu urged his voters to turn out, warning that Arabs were flocking to the polls ""in droves.""
In April last year, Likud sent monitors equipped with body cameras to polling stations in Arab towns on election day, prompting allegations of voter intimidation.
""Benjamin Netanyahu's election strategy is to use the Ahmad Tibi icon as a red alert to his voters,"" said Arik Rudnitzky, a researcher with the Arab-Jewish Relations Program at the Israel Democracy Institute.
""The idea is to signal to those Likud voters who stayed home last time that if you don't go out and vote this time, well, this is going to be the (result),"" Rudnitzky said.
Arab leaders have accused successive Israeli governments of discrimination, saying their towns and villages have been overlooked in areas such as health, education and housing.
They were also angered by U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East plan, published in January, which contains a proposal to put some Arab villages which are now part of Israel into a future Palestinian state. Tibi's home village of Taibe was among them.
But Netanyahu has played down the likelihood of that happening and his party says its 15 billion shekel ($4.37 billion) investment program is more than any government has ever invested in Arab communities.
However, Tibi believes that Netanyahu's rhetoric will prove counterproductive on election day, adding to the 13 seats the Joint List has now in the 120-member parliament.
""These attacks are pushing our voters, our supporters, to go and vote,"" he said. ""This is the side effect of this campaign.""

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh is reconsidering a plan to relocate Rohingya refugees to a flood-prone island located hours by boat from its coast, junior minister for disaster management and relief Enamur Rahman told Reuters on Wednesday.
The proposal to move 100,000 people to Bhasan Char in the Bay of Bengal to ease overcrowding at camps near the Myanmar border had been opposed by many refugees, and some rights experts had warned it could spark a fresh humanitarian crisis. A United Nations investigator who visited last year expressed doubts whether the island was even habitable.
""We have not taken a final decision yet, but we're no longer interested in moving them there,"" Rahman said.
Dhaka was instead ""focusing instead on a safe, dignified and sustainable repatriation"", he added, saying China was actively engaged in talks with Myanmar to expedite this process.
""We're hopeful of a positive outcome,"" Rahman said.
Camps near the border town of Cox's Bazar are home to more than 1 million Rohingya Muslims who have fled neighboring Myanmar following a military-led crackdown since August 2017.
The Hague-based International Court of Justice ordered Myanmar last month to protect the Rohingya against further atrocities and preserve evidence of alleged crimes, after Gambia launched a lawsuit accusing the country of genocide.
A Myanmar government-appointed panel established to probe allegations of abuses against the Rohingya said last month it had found no evidence of genocide.
Densely populated Bangladesh has struggled with the growing number of refugees. Local communities have been increasingly hostile toward Rohingya after a second failed bid to send thousands back to Myanmar in August.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government has already spent tens of millions of dollars to turn Bhasan Char into a permanent landmass and a temporary home for the refugees. It was unclear if the government planned to repurpose the facilities already built on the island.
Humanitarian and human rights groups had criticized the relocation proposal, saying the island is flood-prone and vulnerable to frequent cyclones, and could be completely submerged during a high tide.
Yanghee Lee, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said after visiting last year that she feared a ""new crisis"" if Rohingya were taken to the island.
""There are a number of things that remain unknown to me even following my visit, chief among them being whether the island is truly habitable,"" Lee said."

Wednesday's meeting of senior officials came more than a month after European parties to the deal - France, Britain and Germany - formally accused Iran of violating its terms, setting off a process that could eventually reimpose international sanctions lifted under the agreement.
But, in a move underlining how torn the Europeans are between pressuring Iran not to breach the deal and still trying to save it, the European Union's foreign policy chief said this month the powers would indefinitely extend the time limits in that process to avoid having to reimpose sanctions.
Delegates said that process, known as the dispute resolution mechanism, was not even discussed at Wednesday's meeting, though the Europeans did criticize Iran.
""Serious concerns were expressed regarding the implementation of Iran's nuclear commitments under the agreement,"" the EU foreign policy service's Secretary General Helga Schmid, who chaired the meeting, said in a statement.
""Participants also acknowledged that the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions did not allow Iran to reap the full benefits arising from sanctions-lifting,"" she added.
BREACHES
Iran has breached several central limits of the deal, including on its stock of enriched uranium, in response to the U.S. withdrawal and Washington's reimposition of sanctions that have slashed Iran's oil exports.
Together its ongoing breaches are eroding the deal's central aim - keeping Iran a year away from being able to obtain enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb if it chose to. Iran says it can quickly reverse its breaches if U.S. sanctions are lifted. Washington says its campaign of ""maximum pressure"" will force Iran to negotiate a more sweeping deal.
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi focused on European efforts to set up a vehicle that will allow a small amount of barter trade with Iran, known as Instex, which has yet to perform a transaction.
""It is important that we can say that the JCPOA is still alive,"" he said, referring to the deal by its full name - the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
""We know that the Europeans are trying. We know that there is willingness but the lack of ability is obvious."""

Nearly a million Syrians have been displaced in the past three months by fighting between Turkish-backed rebels and Syrian forces backed by Moscow trying to recapture the last major insurgent-held region in Syria after nine years of war.
""We call on the Syrian regime and its supporters, especially the Russians, to end this offensive and return to the ceasefire arrangements of autumn 2018,"" the 14 ministers said in a column published in French daily newspaper Le Monde.
""We call on them to immediately end hostilities and to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law, in particular the protection of humanitarian workers and medical personnel, who pay with their lives for their engagement in favor of civilian populations.""
Turkey and Russia agreed in September 2018 to create de-escalation zones in Idlib, but that has since unraveled amid the Syrian government offensive, which it says aims to root out militants in the region.
Ankara has sent thousands of troops and truckloads of equipment into the region, in Syria's northwest corner bordering Turkey, to support the rebels, and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to push back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces.
But Assad's forces made fresh gains in southern Idlib province where they took a number of villages on Wednesday, with more hospitals and schools struck by air strikes.
""The fight against terrorism cannot, should not, justify the massive violations of international humanitarian law, which we are witnessing every day in northwest Syria,"" the ministers said.
""We also call on Russia to continue negotiations with Turkey, in order to achieve de-escalation in Idlib and contribute to a political solution,"" they said, calling on Moscow to not block the renewal by the U.N. Security Council of a mechanism allowing cross-border aid to enter the area."

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A major women's rights movement in Pakistan is facing a legal challenge over a march scheduled for next month over allegations that the organizers' activities are ""anti-state"".
The event, known as the Aurat March, using the Urdu word for 'women', has been held in multiple cities in Pakistan for the last two years to coincide with International Women's Day on March 8.
Organisers say they have faced a backlash from conservative elements in the country, including threats of murder and rape.
A petition attempting to bar the march from its announced venue and ban all associated promotion on social media will be heard by a court in Lahore on Thursday, alleging that ""heavy funds"" have been donated to the organizers by ""anti-state forces"".
The case was lodged by a lawyer who has a record of filing cases against freedom of expression on online platforms. While many of his cases have failed, he recently successfully petitioned the same court to declare former Pakistani military dictator Pervez Musharraf's death sentence illegal.
""By openly displaying their aspirations some [of] these women, men and gays dare to take a step ahead in creating the environment that is traditionally, culturally and morally less binding upon them,"" the legal complaint said.
The case against the Aurat March also refers to new social media rules, approved by Pakistan's government this month, which increase regulation of cyber space and that rights activists say could be used to stifle dissent and free speech.
""Our lawyer will counter the petition in court tomorrow,"" one of the organizers, Dr Aliya Haider, told Reuters. ""We hope that the court will decide the matter on merit.""
Earlier this week, a mural put up in Lahore by volunteers to promote the march was vandalized within hours of being set up, supporters said, adding that they had permission from the owners of the structure on which the mural was set up.
Authorities are yet to respond to requests to provide CCTV footage to help identify the vandals.
Global human rights watchdogs have noted concerns in recent years over what they see as a growing clampdown on civil society in Pakistan, along with the increased use of sedition and anti-state charges to quell dissent.
Last year's march attracted tens of thousands of women across Pakistan, which a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll in 2018 found to be the sixth most dangerous country for women."

Data on the cell phone of Mickael Harpon, a 45-year-old IT worker who converted to Islam a decade before last October's attack, supported suspicions his motive was terrorism-related, the judicial source and a police source told Reuters.
""His phone contained a lot of data but we have already isolated one internet search carried out an hour before the attack: 'how to kill infidels',"" the judicial source said, confirming a report in daily Le Parisien.
Harpon was shot dead by police at the scene after he killed three officers and one administrative worker with a kitchen knife.
The investigation into the attack is being led by anti-terrorism prosecutors, which usually indicates a possible terrorism link is the focus of inquiries.
The judicial source said it took several months to break the codes Harpon had used to secure his personal smartphone.
Both sources said the data recovered on it appeared to confirm suspicions Harpon had been radicalised.
The police source, however, cautioned that no evidence had yet been found that Harpon had links to militant group Islamic State, which claimed the attack, or that he had planned it far in advance. The data analysis was still ongoing.
Harpon used the Arabic word ""kouffar"" (infidels) in some of his Internet searches, according to Le Parisien.
An internal report released by French authorities after the attack said that, in 2015, two of Harpon's co-workers had complained about his reaction to the killing by Islamist gunmen of 12 staff at French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
The complaint never went beyond the boss of Harpon's department, who concluded that he posed no threat.
This led to a review of security services practices and in January the government adopted enhanced screening measures. Several policemen suspected of Islamist sympathies have been removed from their positions since Harpon's attack, the Paris police chief said around a month after it happened."

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt held a military funeral on Wednesday for its former president Hosni Mubarak, bestowing the state's final rehabilitation on the man who ruled for 30 years until he was ousted in disgrace in a 2011 popular uprising.
Horses drew Mubarak's coffin draped in the Egyptian flag at a mosque complex as canons fired into the air, followed by a procession led by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, as well as Mubarak's two sons Alaa and Gamal. 
The funeral march was attended by key political figures from Mubarak's years in power, some of whom had been scarcely seen in public since he was removed from office. Sisi stayed for the duration of the procession, offering condolences to Alaa, Gamal and Mubarak's wife Suzanne before his departure.
Mubarak died on Tuesday in intensive care weeks after undergoing surgery, leaving Egyptians divided over the legacy of his era, marked by stagnation and repression but recalled by some as more stable than the chaos that followed.
The stately funeral was a contrast from the rejoicing on the streets in 2011 when he was swept out of power as an early victim of the ""Arab Spring"" revolutions across the region.
He spent many of the subsequent years moving between jail and military hospitals before being freed in 2017 under Sisi, a fellow military officer risen to the presidency, who has jailed Islamist and liberal opponents in the name of stability.
Egypt's presidency and armed forces mourned the former air force officer as a hero for his role in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. The presidency declared three days of national mourning.
Mubarak's coffin was airlifted to the family burial compound from the funeral at Field Marshall Tantawi mosque - named for Mubarak's defense minister of 20 years, who presided over an abortive transition to democracy after Mubarak resigned.
Dozens of Mubarak supporters, some from his home village Kafr al-Meselha in the Nile Delta, gathered outside the mosque.
FAREWELL OF 30 YEARS
""This is the history of 30 years, the farewell of 30 years,"" said Zeenat Touhami, a 35-year-old woman from Cairo, who described herself as happy that Mubarak's ""pride was restored"" after his fall, and that the state was showing appreciation to him after his death.
A small crowd also gathered outside of his burial site in the upscale neighborhood of Heliopolis, where supporters chanted: ""Alaa, tell your father that the 100 million [Egyptians] are saying goodbye.""
Mohamed Zaree, a human rights activist, said autocracy and economic hardship were now worse under Sisi than under Mubarak.
Sisi, who came to power after leading the overthrow of Mubarak's Islamist successor, Mohamed Mursi, has overseen a broad crackdown on dissent, which rights groups say is the most severe in recent memory.
""Mubarak’s era was painful (but) this era is much more difficult and painful in terms of freedoms and economic conditions,"" Zaree said.
Many of the activists who helped organize mass protests which ousted Mubarak are now behind bars or live in exile abroad. Sisi's supporters say a crackdown was needed to stabilize the country after the turmoil that followed 2011.
Mubarak was sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to murder 239 demonstrators during the 18-day revolt in 2011, but was freed in 2017 after being cleared of those charges.
He was also convicted in 2015 along with his two sons of diverting public funds to upgrade family properties. They were sentenced to three years in jail.
Egyptian state and private newspapers ran front page pictures of Mubarak, while state TV showed excerpts of previous speeches.

This was a stark contrast to the treatment of his successor, Mursi, Egypt's first freely elected leader, who lasted only a year in office before the army toppled him. Mursi died last year after collapsing in court while on trial on espionage charges. Egyptian media, which are tightly controlled, paid little attention to his death.

The Athens government infuriated residents of five Aegean islands - all straddling a key route to Europe used by thousands of migrants - by announcing two weeks ago that it would expedite the construction of secured detention centers to replace open-access, severely overcrowded camps. Local residents say they are concerned such an arrangement could become permanent.
In a second straight day of disturbances on Wednesday, local crowds tried to approach a site earmarked for a new migrant center, precipitating clashes with police on a road winding through a hilly forest. 
""More than 1,000 people protesting at the new facility... threw stones at police, smashing their helmets. Police were forced to use chemicals,"" a police spokesman said, using a euphemism for tear gas.
Earlier in the day, hundreds of people gathered in the town of Mytilene on Lesbos as part of a general strike to protest at government plans to create the new closed migrant facility.
On Tuesday, locals used vehicles and rubbish trucks to try to block police reinforcements and heavy machinery in a port. 
The Athens government says the closed centers will offer greater security and safety to both asylum seekers and local residents, and plans to build them on the islands of Samos, Kos, Leros and Chios in addition to Lesbos.
Locals say the islands are carrying a disproportionate burden from a migrant crisis that began in 2015 when more than one million people fled violence in the Middle East and beyond via Turkey, reaching Greece and then moving on to wealthier central and northern Europe, their preferred destinations.

Border closures imposed since then along the migrant corridor through the Balkans and central Europe north of Greece have left many thousands of later arrivals marooned on Greek islands near Turkey.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan’s presidential palace confirmed on Wednesday that a ceremony to swear in Ashraf Ghani as president has been delayed, but contradicted reasons cited a day earlier by the U.S. government behind the postponement.
The U.S. State Department on Tuesday said that the Afghan government had agreed to postpone its presidential inauguration, citing an electoral feud in which both Ghani and his main rival Abdullah Abdullah claimed victory in disputed Sept. 28 elections.
Ghani was scheduled to take the oath of office on Thursday, according to an Afghan official, but a statement from the presidential palace on Wednesday said the event would now be held on March 9.
The reasons the presidential palace cited for the delay pertained to “rumors about coronavirus in Afghanistan” and the short notice for world leaders to attend the inauguration.
The United States wanted Ghani to defer his second-term inauguration over concerns it could inflame an election feud with his political rival and jeopardize U.S.-led peacemaking efforts, sources familiar with the matter had said.
U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been in Kabul since last week trying to defuse tensions, said on Twitter that the postponement would allow time for “necessary consultations”.
“President Ghani, as the declared winner, and other leaders should ensure that the new government is inclusive and reflects the aspirations of all Afghans,” added Khalilzad, who is expected to sign an agreement with the Taliban on behalf of the United States in Doha on Saturday.
The signing of an agreement, which will include the pulling out of U.S. troops, is to be culmination of a seven-day “reduction in violence” understanding currently being observed in Afghanistan between U.S., Afghan and Taliban forces.
President Donald Trump has made the withdrawal of U.S. service members from Afghanistan after 18 years of fighting a major foreign policy objective.
Officials privy to the talks had said the signed agreement with the Taliban will be followed by negotiations on an intra-Afghan political settlement between the Taliban and an Afghan delegation.
Members of the Afghan delegation have yet to be announced. Reaching a consensus on members could pose a challenge with the Ghani-Abdullah Abdullah feud.
Abdullah Abdullah also wants representation in the delegation and subsequent talks, Western diplomats in Kabul familiar with the process told Reuters, but Ghani was reluctant to oblige."

""We are asking nurses and medical staff from countries around the world to come to China now, to help us in this battle,"" wrote Zeng Yingchun and Zhen Yan in the appeal published on Feb. 24 on the website of The Lancet.
The nurses, who work at hospitals in southern Guangdong province, said they had gone to Wuhan on Jan. 24 to work in the isolation wards.
""The conditions and environment here in Wuhan are more difficult and extreme than we could ever have imagined,"" they wrote.
China has strictly controlled the flow of information about the virus, cracking down on criticism of authorities' handling of the outbreak and scrubbing critical posts on domestic social media.
DXY, a popular Chinese online platform for healthcare information, posted an article about the Lancet letter on Wednesday morning. The article sparked discussions on microblogging platform Weibo but was deleted by the afternoon.
It was not clear why the nurses had sought to appeal for help via the journal nor the circumstances around publication of the letter. Neither Zeng, the lead author, nor the journal immediately responded to emails seeking comment on the letter.
China has reported more than 78,000 coronavirus cases and 2,715 deaths, with most still concentrated in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province. The outbreak has overwhelmed Wuhan hospitals and pictures of exhausted nurses and doctors frequently circulate on social media.
While Beijing has issued appeals for medical supplies from abroad, it has not publicly asked for help from foreign medical workers.
The nurses described the challenges of working long hours in extreme conditions. Frequent hand washing has led to painful rashes, they said, while some nurses have pressure ulcers on their ears and forehead after wearing an N95 respirator over long periods of time.
More than 3,000 medical staff in China have been infected by the virus, an official at China's National Health Commission said on Monday. At least nine have died.
A letter published on Wednesday in the Guangdong newspaper Southern (NYSE:SO) Metropolis Daily representing the medical team dispatched by Guangdong province to assist in Wuhan distanced itself from the nurses' appeal for help.
It said that the two were not part of its medical team and that their description of conditions was not accurate.
Though the team had faced some challenges in the first days after arriving at Wuhan's Hankou hospital, conditions had improved, it said, and there were sufficient supplies of materials while staff had reasonable schedules.

Hokkaido, the northernmost island famous for its mountains and brown bears, has Japan's highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases outside Tokyo, with 38 infections and one death, and residents are nervous.
""I would feel so much better if my son could test for the coronavirus like the regular flu,"" said Naoko Maeda, whose 16-year-old son has a runny nose, adding that she had seen shops run out of masks and disinfectants.
""I do think the government response was too late. On top of that we don't have much information either, and now it's come to this and I feel a bit panicky.""
Japan had close to 170 cases of coronavirus infections as of Wednesday, apart from 691 reported from a cruise ship that was quarantined of Tokyo earlier this month.
Hokkaido Governor Naomichi Suzuki asked all public schools to close from Thursday through to March 4.
""This is an unprecedented case and there may be criticism that we are going overboard. But I will bear the responsibility and would like to ask for the public's understanding and cooperation,"" he told reporters.
Sapporo, the picturesque capital of the province which hosted the Winter Olympics in 1972, is due to hold marathons and walking races during the 2020 Summer Olympics, but the outbreak has raised questions about whether they will go ahead.
""I'm not in a position to decide whether to hold the Olympics or not,"" Yoshiharu Fujita, director of local government's School Health and Athletics Division, told Reuters.
""But I really want people around the world to come to Hokkaido for a great experience.""
Mei Isikawa, manager of Sapporo's tourism department, said 130,000 foreigners had canceled trips to Sapporo in February and March.
The Yoichi whisky factory has suspended tours and a street famous for its ramen noodles, popular with tourists and locals alike, was nearly empty.
""We know that this virus will only spread even more,"" said the mother of a seven-year-old elementary school student, who asked not to be identified.
""It's probably come to a point where there's no stopping it."""

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy signaled a potential reshuffle of his government on Wednesday that local media said could include axing Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk in favor of businessman and veteran politician Serhiy Tihipko.
Confidence in Zelenskiy's government has slid since the actor and comedian scored a surprise landslide election victory last year promising to root out corruption and end the war with Russian-backed rebels in the eastern Donbass region.
But progress on either front has been patchy, and while the 42-year-old Zelenskiy remains Ukraine's most electable politician, his public trust score has fallen from a high watermark of 79% in September to 51% in February, according to a survey by the Kiev-based Razumkov Centre think-tank.
Honcharuk's position had already come into the spotlight in January after the leak of an embarrassing audio recording that suggested he had criticized the president in a closed meeting with the finance minister and central bank.
Any reshuffle would come just as Ukraine is trying to secure the release of billions of dollars in loans from the International Monetary Fund, a move contingent on Kiev's progress in passing reforms and tackling graft.
""I am conducting interviews with many people now,"" Zelenskiy said in a response to a question from reporters on whether he had met Tihipko about giving him a government post. ""And I also met with Mr. Tihipko. It's true.""
Tihipko has not commented on media reports that he had been offered the prime minister's job. The president's office referred back to Zelenskiy's comments when asked whether Tihipko had been interviewed for the post of premier.
A source familiar with the situation said work in the prime minister's office was carrying on as normal, adding that over the last three months there had been constant efforts to remove Honcharuk.
Tihipko, 60, has been deputy prime minister twice, first under President Leonid Kuchma in a short-lived 1997 government, and then again in 2010 under President Viktor Yanukovich, who eventually fled to Russia after the 2014 Maidan street protests.
He has also been central bank governor and co-founded PrivatBank, the former Soviet republic's largest lender.
Zelenskiy has prioritized ending the war in Donbass but while he has implemented some confidence-building measures with Russia, including prisoner swaps, the conflict simmers on.
In October, 48.2% of Ukrainians rated those in power as better than their predecessors, but that figure declined to 29.5% in February, according to the same Razumkov survey."

Karimova, 47, was jailed in March 2019 for violating the terms of her house arrest after receiving a five-year sentence in 2015 on charges of embezzlement and extortion.
In an open letter to President Shavkat Mirziyoyev published on Wednesday, she said she had not been told how long she was supposed to remain behind bars, but asked him to allow her release, citing ill health and an urgent need for surgery.
In exchange, Karimova said she would stop legally contesting the Tashkent government's efforts to confiscate from her $686 million in assets already frozen by authorities in Switzerland.
Karimova, a powerful businesswoman before she fell out with her own father around 2014, said the Uzbek government has already confiscated $1.2 billion worth of her assets.
State prosecutors said last August they had launched a fresh criminal probe against Karimova on charges which included illegally privatising state property, but there have been no official reports about her conviction on those charges."

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan has made a surprise opening to Israel, announced compensation over the bombing of a U.S. warship 20 years ago, and said it will fully cooperate with the International Criminal Court on cases about Darfur.
All are measures that could help rebuild ties with the West after decades of international isolation and help unlock urgently needed financial support for a reeling economy.
But the steps -- all in the past month -- may not be enough.
International donors are holding back, demanding more transparency on public and military spending, an economic reform plan, and the lifting of fuel subsidies estimated to cost about $3.5 billion a year.
The risk, say some Sudanese, is that the economy could collapse without sufficient support, in turn fuelling political strife that could endanger prospects for a new era of democracy.
It is unclear when substantial support could materialize.
Potential donors from the West and the Gulf have met several times, but they have postponed from April to June a ""Friends of Sudan"" economic conference where pledges could be made.
The United States has signaled that Sudan could be removed from a list of countries seen as state sponsors of terrorism, but has given no timeframe.
Being on the list complicates efforts to negotiate a deal for Sudan's foreign debt, unblock funding from international lenders and connect Sudan to international banking systems.
ECONOMIC CRISIS
A government of technocrats, appointed under a power-sharing deal between civilians and the military due to last until late 2022, is lurching through an economic crisis that has only deepened since the overthrow of long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir last April.
""We have economic ideas about how to overcome this. But all these theories depend on some type of help or assistance from the outside world,"" Information Minister Faisal Salih told Reuters. ""We need real, massive assistance.""
The finance minister said in November that the government needed up to $5 billion to avert economic collapse. Since then, officials have been struggling to contain worsening fuel and bread shortages linked to a scarcity of dollars and smuggling of subsidized goods, despite some aid from the Gulf.
Inflation running at more than 60% -- one of the highest rates in the world -- has crippled spending power, more than nine million out of a rapidly growing population of 43 million need humanitarian relief and child malnutrition is rising.
Ministers say they have made progress in a peace process aimed at healing long-running internal conflicts, but that economic challenges are bigger than expected, imperiling a transition designed to usher in a new era of democracy.
Though the government still enjoys support on the street, diplomats and analysts say it is overwhelmed and worry that the public could lose patience.
""I don't think there is a strategic awareness that this moment in history is very decisive for Sudan,"" said Suliman Baldo, a senior policy advisor at the Enough Project, a Washington-based research and advocacy group.
""You either have a transition to civilian rule and democracy, or you will be heading down toward a situation of a failed economy and a failed state.""
The government faces internal opposition over economic reforms. Ministers have retreated from any major steps on subsidies until after an economic conference in late March with the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC), a fractured grouping of political movements that backed the uprising and negotiated the power-sharing deal.
CORRUPTION
That is a problem for donors. ""If they don't do something about the fuel subsidies, they're not going to get any money, simple as that,"" said one Western diplomat. An announcement of a two-tier pricing system at some fuel stations from mid-February was insufficient, he added.
Influential left-wing currents with the FCC say outside aid is not needed, preferring to focus on retrieving funds lost through corruption and trying to reverse the accumulation of wealth by Sudan's security apparatus under Bashir.
Steps have been taken to neutralize Bashir's Islamist networks in ministries and the intelligence services, but the military's high command and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are leading Sudan's top body, the sovereign council, for the first 21 months of the transition, so their interests are harder to challenge.
Investigations are going on into the violent dispersal of a protest last week, and the lethal crackdown on a sit-in in June in which civilian groups said more than 100 people were killed by RSF-led forces -- accusations the RSF has sought to deflect.
The results will be ""disruptive"" whatever the findings, but top members of the military would have immunity unless it is lifted by the constitutional court or a legislative committee that is yet to be appointed, said Nabil Adib, a 77-year-old lawyer leading the probe.
Military factions were using the transitional period to expand their power, said Sadiq Farouk, an FFC leader from the Sudanese Communist Party.
""The financial crisis is not the subsidies, it's the resource allocation within the transitional authority,"" he said. ""More aid will not resolve Sudan's issues.""
For this year's budget, officials announced a contribution of $2 billion from the military, but diplomats saw the offer as proof of unaccountable economic power.
General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the charismatic leader of the RSF who has interests in Sudan’s gold trade, has been working to polish his image, using a peace process to engage with rebel groups he once fought in the troubled western region of Darfur.
Salih acknowledged ""some resistance"" to attempts to limit military expenditure and bring economic resources under civilian control, but said there were no alternatives to sharing power. ""It's a very difficult partnership but we have to work together,"" he said."

DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates, a major international air transit center, is prepared for ""worst case scenarios"" as the new coronavirus spreads in the Middle East, a government official said on Wednesday.
Three Gulf Arab states recorded their first new coronavirus cases this week, all in people coming from Iran, the UAE's neighbor across the Gulf which on Wednesday reported a total of 19 virus-related deaths, the most outside China, and 139 cases.
UAE authorities have enough facilities to quarantine patients and will be carrying out surveillance on people entering the country, said the official from the UAE National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority.
It was too early to ban public gatherings in the business, trade and tourism hub, added the official. Dubai is due to host the Expo 2020 world fair in October for six months.
The UAE has reported 13 cases of the new coronavirus since Jan. 28, three of whom have recovered.
""We are quite satisfied that we have taken all the necessary steps needed to preempt the spread of the virus at all levels, without pushing the country into a state of unwarranted panic,"" the UAE official said.
The disease, which originated in China late last year, has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China.
Kuwait, which last week evacuated 700 people from Iran, said on Wednesday that the number of people diagnosed with the virus had risen to 25 after 13 more cases were confirmed.
Bahrain, which has suspended flights to Dubai, on Wednesday reported a rise in cases to 26, some of whom had traveled through the UAE. Oman has recorded four cases.
Major Gulf bourses slid on Wednesday, mirroring declines in global stocks over the spread of the virus. Air Arabia (DU:AIRA) extended losses from the previous session to trade 2.8% lower, after the UAE on Tuesday suspended all flights to and from Iran.
Several Arab countries have suspended flights to Iran and other destinations and imposed shipping restrictions.
Kuwait has barred foreign ships, except those carrying oil, from departing to or arriving from several countries, according to a Feb. 25 notice seen by Reuters."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Moscow court has ruled that a former U.S. marine accused of drunkenly assaulting Russian police officers six months ago last summer must remain in custody.
Trevor Reed, 28, from Texas, was arrested in Moscow in August. But his case, which could be another irritant in strained U.S.-Russian ties, was not made public until reports late on Tuesday by the New York Times and the TASS news agency.
The court confirmed Reed's detention on its website on Wednesday, saying his case would next be heard in court on March 11.
Reed's lawyer and family could not immediately be reached for comment. The charge against him carries a penalty of up to 10 years in jail.
Reed is accused of attacking police officers in a car after they detained him at an address where he was inebriated, TASS cited case materials as saying. He denied the allegations during a preliminary investigation, it said.
Reed's father told the New York Times that he and the defense believed the allegations to be false. He called on the U.S. government to look into the case.
The U.S. embassy in Moscow did not immediately comment, but said it had passed on a Reuters request for comment to Washington.
The New York Times cited a statement from Reed's relatives saying the former U.S. Marine had visited Moscow in May to learn Russian and spend time with his Russian girlfriend, whom he had met in Greece.
It said police had been summoned after a party on Aug. 15 where Reed had drunk vodka and grown agitated. Reed's girlfriend and others had called the police to prevent him getting hurt, it said.
Moscow's relations with Washington are at post-Cold War lows and have been further strained by two prominent cases against U.S. nationals.
They include embezzlement charges against U.S. investor Michael Calvey, who is being held under house arrest, and the case of Paul Whelan, a former U.S. marine accused of espionage who has been held in custody since his arrest in December 2018.
Both deny the charges against them."

On Wednesday, Pope Francis added a modern twist to the list of things to quit during the season and beyond: insulting people on social media.
The pope made his appeal to tone things down while speaking to tens of thousands of people in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) for his general audience on Ash Wednesday, the start of the 40-day season that leads up to Easter.
Lent, he said in partially improvised remarks, ""is a time to give up useless words, gossip, rumors, tittle-tattle and speak to God on a first name basis,"" he said.
""We live in an atmosphere polluted by too much verbal violence, too many offensive and harmful words, which are amplified by the internet,"" he said. ""Today, people insult each other as if they were saying 'Good Day.'""
In recent years, Francis himself has been the butt of insults from ultra-conservative Catholic websites and mostly anonymous anti-pope Twitter feeds.
Twitter has also become a platform for sometimes pitched verbal battles between his supporters and detractors.
Later on Wednesday, Francis was due to have ashes rubbed on his forehead at a traditional Ash Wednesday service that reminds Christians of mortality and that everyone will someday become dust.
During Lent, which is marked by repentance, fasting and reflection, the faithful are also called on to practice more good deeds, such as alms giving, and to be particularly closer to the needy."

""We are fine, but pretty bored. We cannot go anywhere, just to the restaurants to have tea or coffee,"" Betts, from Leicestershire in central England, told Reuters by telephone. ""We had no news since we were tested for temperature yesterday.""
Guests found out about the lockdown when they woke up on Tuesday morning via a note slipped below their door, he said. Confined to their room for the day, he and wife spent their time watching TV and surfing the internet, he said, but were looking forward to being allowed to use the hotel's pool and garden again on Wednesday.
The lockdown was imposed after an Italian doctor staying at the hotel tested positive for the virus late on Monday.
His wife and two more people who traveled with them tested positive on Tuesday. The four, who have been hospitalized, were part of a group of 10 who had traveled to Tenerife in Spain's Canary Islands, a popular winter sun destination for European tourists off the coast of West Africa.
A Reuters reporter saw police wearing face masks standing outside the hotel, while tourists could be seen on their balconies.
Betts said guests had been brought picnic breakfasts in their rooms. He was provided with blood pressure tablets after telling medical staff he did not have any left.
A group of a hundred tourists who arrived at the hotel on Monday and did not have contact with the Italian guests would be allowed to leave the hotel, the Canary's regional authorities said late on Tuesday. Most hotel guests show no symptoms, they said. 
Health authorities in Madrid announced a new coronavirus case in the region on Wednesday, taking the number of cases detected over the past weeks to 10 - though two people have now been discharged.
The person who tested positive in Madrid on Wednesday had traveled recently to northern Italy, the center of the biggest outbreak of the flu-like virus in Europe, regional authorities said. 

Health Minister Salvador Illa played down the severity of the outbreak in Spain, emphasizing that all cases have been imported from abroad and there had not yet been any domestic transmission of the infection.

MAGLAJ, Bosnia (Reuters) - They played football together as young men. Then they fought each other in a 1990s war in three rival Bosnian armies. Now, as the country goes from one crisis to another, the three veterans feel it is their duty to warn of the horrors of war.
Rizo Salkic ""Talijan"", Marko Zelic and Boro Jevtic, the Bosniak, Croat and Serb wartime commanders from the central town of Maglaj, have become unlikely peace activists nearly a quarter of a century after the end of the Bosnian war that finally sealed the collapse of Yugoslavia.
""It is sad that even today ... we must talk about peace and reconciliation,"" said Zelic, the wartime chief of military police in the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) in the Maglaj area.
The U.S.-brokered Dayton peace agreement that ended the 1992-95 war split the country into two autonomous regions - the Federation dominated by Croats and Bosniaks, and the Serb-dominated Serb Republic - linked via a weak central government.
But political quarrels among top nationalists have prevented reconciliation. The discord has also blocked Bosnia's economic progress and integration into the European Union and NATO, helping drive young and educated people to leave the country.
Hostility deepened this month after Milorad Dodik, the Serb member of Bosnia's tripartite inter-ethnic presidency, again threatened that the Serb region might secede from Bosnia in a row over the Constitutional Court, and called on Serb officials to block the work of national institutions.
""We live again in turbulent times when we need to talk of peace perhaps even more than before,"" Zelic said. 
""Young people have to be aware how easy it is to start a war and how difficult it is to avoid it.""
The three veterans, who fought each other off and on as the war changed course, are touring Bosnia to speak about their war experiences.
Each was wounded, with Salkic, a deminer, having been injured seven times. Even during the war, they helped each other - Jevtic once saved Salkic's life even though they were on opposing sides of the frontline. 
They continued to meet and socialize in postwar Maglaj, and at one point began spontaneously to talk about the war together. They viewed it differently, but they listened to each other.
""We did not always agree but concluded that all of us think the same: We were tricked into the war,"" Salkic said.
Their friendship has drawn public attention. A film about them made by the Bosnia mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe is being shown across the country.
Some in the audience during a screening in Sarajevo said the three men were brave to talk openly about the senselessness of war at a time when reconciliation was being put on the back burner in Bosnia. 

""There is nothing heroic in saying that war is stupidity and a loss of time, lives and property,"" Jevtic told Reuters.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's decades-old political rivals Mahathir Mohamad and Anwar Ibrahim set out claims to lead the Southeast Asian country on Wednesday after Mahathir's shock resignation as prime minister sparked turmoil.
The struggle between Mahathir, 94, and Anwar, 72, who formed a surprise pact to win a 2018 election, has shaped Malaysian politics for more than two decades and is at the root of the latest crisis.
Mahathir, the world's oldest head of government in his role as interim prime minister, proposed a unified administration without political party allegiances at a time Malaysia faces a flagging economy and the impact of the new coronavirus.
""Politics and political parties need to be put aside for now,"" Mahathir said in a televised message. ""I propose a government that is not aligned with any party, but only prioritizes the interests of the country.""
Anwar later said he opposed forming a ""backdoor government"" and that three parties from the former Pakatan ruling coalition had proposed his name to the king as candidate for prime minister.
""We wait for the decision of the king,"" he told a news conference.
To try to end the crisis, Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah has been meeting all 222 elected members of parliament over two days.
Those in the meetings said they were asked to name their favored prime minister or whether they wanted fresh elections.
Anwar's Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR), or the People’s Justice Party, has 39 seats and alliance partners could potentially give it another 62.
While some politicians have openly voiced support for Mahathir to stay in office, it was not clear whether enough of them would give him their backing.
POLITICAL TANGLE
The volatile relationship between Anwar and Mahathir helped prompt the latest crisis after Mahathir resisted pressure to set a date for a promised transfer of power to Anwar made ahead of the 2018 election.
As well as personal relationships, politics in Malaysia is shaped by a tangle of ethnic and religious interests. The largely Muslim country of 32 million is more than half ethnic Malay, but has large ethnic Chinese, Indian and other minorities.
A unity government cutting across party lines could give Mahathir greater authority than during a spell as prime minister from 1981 until his retirement in 2003.
But the idea was rejected on Tuesday by an alliance of four parties including the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which ruled Malaysia for six decades until being defeated by Mahathir's coalition in 2018.
The four parties said they had told the king they wanted a new election instead.
After their election defeat under former prime minister Najib Razak, those parties' fortunes have been on the rise while the Pakatan coalition of Mahathir and Anwar has lost five by-elections 
Anwar was Mahathir's deputy and a rising political star when Mahathir was prime minister the first time but they fell out.

Anwar was arrested and jailed in the late 1990s for sodomy and corruption, charges that he and his supporters maintain were aimed at ending his political career.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - China's embassy in Russia has demanded authorities in Moscow end what it said are discriminatory anti-coronavirus measures against Chinese nationals, saying they are damaging relations and alarming Chinese residents of the Russian capital.
The complaint, detailed in an embassy letter to the city's authorities and published by Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta late on Tuesday, deplored what it called ""ubiquitous monitoring"" of Chinese nationals, including on public transport in Moscow.
Russia, which enjoys strong political and military ties with Beijing, does not currently have any confirmed cases of coronavirus, but has temporarily barred many categories of Chinese nationals from entering the country.
Authorities in Moscow have also been carrying out raids on potential carriers of the virus - individuals at their homes or hotels - and using facial recognition technology to enforce quarantine measures.
The Chinese embassy letter followed unconfirmed local media reports that Mosgortrans, which runs Moscow's vast bus, trolleybus and tram networks, had told drivers to try to identify Chinese passengers and inform police of their presence.
""The special monitoring of Chinese nationals on Moscow's public transportation does not exist in any country, even in the United States and in Western states,"" the Chinese Embassy letter, dated Feb. 24, read.
""Given an improvement in the epidemiological situation in China, Moscow residents and Chinese people living in Moscow will be worried and won't understand, and it will harm the good atmosphere for developing Chinese-Russian relations.""
The embassy said it was asking Moscow authorities to refrain from taking what it called excessive measures and to embrace ""proportionate and non-discriminatory measures"" instead.
The Kremlin said it was unaware of the embassy letter, but that Moscow valued its relations with Beijing and there should be no discriminatory measures against Chinese nationals.
Russia's Foreign Ministry, the Moscow city government and a representative of the Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Russia has had two confirmed cases of coronavirus so far. Both were Chinese nationals who have since recovered and been released from hospital.
Asia reported hundreds of new cases on Wednesday, including the first U.S. soldier to be infected, as the United States warned of an inevitable pandemic, and outbreaks in Italy and Iran spread to more countries."

The court was due to hear a challenge by Mohammed against publication of previous rulings in the case by England's High Court. Princess Haya and the court-appointed guardian of the children supported publication of judgments, the court heard.
The wardship battle over their two children began in May last year and there have been a number of hearings at London's High Court before the President of the Family Division, Andrew McFarlane, which have been held in private.
The two parties said in a statement in July last year that the case did not concern divorce or finances but was limited to their children's welfare.
Sheikh Mohammed has applied to the court for the summary return of his children to Dubai. Haya has asked the court to protect one of her children from a forced marriage and to grant a non-molestation order, a type of injunction that protects against harassment or threats.
""This appeal arises from wardship proceedings in the High Court concerning two children who are at present within the jurisdiction of the Court,"" Justice Nicholas Underhill, Vice-President of the Court of Appeal, said.
The wardship proceedings are still ongoing and there will be a ""welfare hearing"" at the end of next month, he said.

The accusations provoked Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to walk out of a heated parliamentary debate on Tuesday after a lawmaker of the outlawed opposition Future Forward Party presented documents that he said bore out the claims.
""I don't know about this, I don't have this type of policy,"" Prayuth told reporters on Wednesday, referring to the documents.
""We will investigate, but there is no policy.""
The lawmaker, Wiroj Lakkhanaadisorn, had told parliament the documents showed Prayuth's government was funding military-run smear campaigns to systematically harass opponents and praise the government on social media.
He read from what he said were two leaked military memos that ordered army personnel to create fake social media accounts to ""offer counternarrative"" for criticism of the government.
Reuters has not examined the documents.
""The army works in the open and we don't use avatars,"" Lieutenant General Thanya Kiatsarn, of the second army area command, a unit the opposition said figured in one of the memos, told the Khaosod newspaper.
Some soldiers may be using social media to defend the reputation of the military but the effort was not centrally organized, he added.
Facebook and Twitter did not immediately respond to emails to seek comment.
Prayuth's coalition majority was strengthened by the disbanding last week of Future Forward, the third-largest party in parliament, on the grounds that the party breached the law when it took a loan from its founder.
The dissolution has sparked daily protests among university students who are among the party's most vocal supporters.
Following Friday's court ruling to dissolve the party, its members have launched a string of accusations against Prayuth and the former military junta he led for five years before elections in 2019.
The ruling banned from politics 11 party lawmakers who lost their seats, while giving the 65 remaining MPs 60 days to either form a new party or join an existing one."

Elyes Fakhfakh, who was designated prime minister last month by President Kais Saied, has brought parties from across the political spectrum into his cabinet - and they continue to disagree on several big policy areas.
His government is expected to pass a confidence vote later on Wednesday, however, though it may prove fragile after struggling to reconcile the differences over policy and cabinet positions.
If it were to lose the vote, another parliamentary election would be held.
The last election, held in October, produced a deeply fragmented house in which no party won more than a quarter of the seats. An earlier attempt to form a government was defeated in a confidence vote in January.
Introducing his proposed government's program in parliament on Wednesday, Fakhfakh said its priorities would include fighting widespread corruption and reforming public services and the state phosphate producer.
It would work to maintain the value of the currency, which has recovered in recent months after years of decline, he added. Central Bank governor Marwan Abbasi said this month that the International Monetary Fund had been in favor of the dinar losing some value to bolster exports.
The new government would immediately face a major economic challenge after years of low growth, persistent unemployment, big government deficits, mounting debt, high inflation, a weak currency and deteriorating public services.

Singapore has won international praise for its fastidious approach in tackling the virus - which has included using police investigators and security cameras to help track suspect carriers. The wealthy island state, an important regional financial center and transport hub, has confirmed 91 cases so far.
The health ministry on Wednesday said it had charged a 38-year-old man from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus first surfaced late last year, and his wife who resides in Singapore for allegedly providing false information to authorities about their movements for contact tracing.
The husband had been confirmed to be infected with the virus in late January, and has since recovered, while his wife had been quarantined due to her close contact with him.
The health ministry said ""detailed investigations"" had established their true movements and they were charged ""in view of the potentially serious repercussions of the false information...and the risk they could have posed to public health"".
Charges under the Infectious Diseases Act are rare and this is the first case during the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore. First time offenders under the Act can be fined up to S$10,000 ($7,147) or imprisoned for six months, or both.
Also on Wednesday, Singapore said a 45-year-old man lost his residency status after failing to comply with an order to stay at home for 14 days when he returned from China. The city-state - known for its tough laws - has also canceled work passes and cut employers' rights to hire foreigners for breaches of other virus prevention measures."
398,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 05:29AM ET</span>","Coronavirus cases rise in Italy, with children among new cases","ROME (Reuters) - An outbreak of coronavirus in northern Italy worsened on Wednesday, with more than 30 new cases confirmed in the two worst-hit regions and children found to have the illness for the first time.
Officials in Lombardy, which includes Italy's financial capital Milan, said cases had risen overnight to 259 from 240 on Tuesday, with four children, including a 4-year-old girl, infected in the first such cases in the country. 
In neighboring Veneto, the number of people confirmed to have caught the flu-like virus was 58, an increase of 13 on the previous tally given on Tuesday.
The death toll from the contagion, which came to light on Friday, remained unchanged at 11. All those who have died so far have been elderly and most had underlying health problems.
After first emerging in Italy in Lombardy and Veneto, the country's economic powerhouse, the illness has now spread to seven other regions, including Sicily in the far south, with the total number of cases nationwide climbing above 350. 
Italians or people who had recently visited the north of the country have tested positive in Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Croatia and France since the weekend, showing how far and fast the illness - which was first identified in China last month - could spread.
In bid to halt the outbreak, authorities have shut schools, universities, museums, cinemas and theaters across much of the north. Many countries have advised their nationals not to visit the north of Italy and hoteliers have reported a wave of cancellations, putting the local tourism industry at threat.
""We should stay calm, there is no reason to be particularly afraid,"" said Elisabetta Jacona, a Milan resident and doctor.
""The only advice I can give, as a doctor, is telling people who are more at risk, elderly people or people with previous pathologies ... to avoid going out.""

Analysts have warned that the outbreak could shunt Italy's fragile economy into its fourth recession in 12 years.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A group of parents fighting against child ""abductions"" by their partners accused Japan in a lawsuit on Wednesday of having a double standard in how it treats domestic instances of such incidents, compared to international ones.
Fourteen plaintiffs in the Tokyo District Court lawsuit say it is unconstitutional that Japan does not have a system to prevent violation of their parental rights, particularly since it has signed an international treaty on such abductions.
The class action will turn up the heat on Japan's justice system as more left-behind parents decry the effective condoning by courts and law enforcement of a practice other developed countries treat as a crime.
""It's time for Japan to solve this issue,"" said Catherine Henderson, an Australian schoolteacher in Tokyo who says her husband left with their two children last April without warning, despite divorce court proceedings.
""I had no idea that in Japan, the rights of children to see both parents are not upheld by the family court,"" the only non-Japanese plaintiff told a news conference.
There was no immediate government reaction on the filing of the lawsuit, and no date has yet been set for a hearing.
No official figures keep track of the number of families affected, but non-profit Kizuna Child-Parent Reunion estimates that 150,000 children lose contact with a parent every year because of estrangement from the non-custodial parent.
""Japan made an agreement internationally but hasn't aligned its domestic laws to make it wrong,"" said lead counsel Tomoshi Sakka. ""I'm curious to see how the government will explain this discrepancy.""
Japan became the last G7 country to join the 1980 Hague Abduction Convention just six years ago, following intense pressure from the United States and other nations.
The treaty lets parents petition to have children returned to their country of ""habitual residence"" if that country considers the removal ""wrongful"".   
Asked about the discrepancy, a foreign ministry official told Reuters the ministry was not aware of how domestic cases were treated, but that it held mediation based on the notion that parental child abduction was ""wrongful"".
Since Japan joined the treaty, the foreign ministry has mediated return orders in about 100 cases, with the largest number from the United States.
Last week, two European fathers based in Japan urged European Union lawmakers to pressure Tokyo to tackle parental child abduction by changing a law that does not recognize joint child custody following divorce.
Italy and Germany warn against the practices in Japan in travel advisories they have posted."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - New Delhi was the world's most polluted capital city for the second straight year in 2019, according to a Swiss-based group that gathers air-quality data globally.
India was also home to 21 of the world's 30 most polluted cities, IQ AirVisual said in the study which focused on the amount of PM2.5, fine particulate matter, in major urban areas.
The study measured the concentration of poisonous PM2.5, particles that are less than 2.5 microns in diameter and can be carried deep into the lungs, as higher PM2.5 levels could cause deadly diseases, including cancer and cardiac problems.
In 2019, New Delhi's average annual concentration of PM2.5 in a cubic meter of air was 98.6, the study said, more than double the level of Beijing, which averaged 42.1 during the year, making it the ninth most polluted city in the world.
New Delhi's toxic air is caused by vehicle and industrial emissions, dust from building sites, smoke from the burning of rubbish and crop residue in nearby fields.
Last year, residents of New Delhi, home to more than 20 million people, could breathe ""moderate"" to ""satisfactory"" air only for four days in November and December, when pollution levels peaked.
Late last year, the spike in air pollution levels forced authorities, who termed the crisis as a public health emergency, to shut schools twice.
The study, however, said India did see ""widespread improvements"" in PM2.5 levels in 2019 compared to a year earlier, largely due to favorable meteorological conditions, government efforts to clean the air and an overall economic slowdown.
""Despite improvements, India still faces serious air pollution challenges,"" the study said."
406,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2020 01:47AM ET</span>","Don't give China excuse to attack Taiwan during virus outbreak, ministry advisers say","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan should continue to show goodwill to China during the outbreak of the new coronavirus and not give Beijing an excuse to attack the island as a way of relieving ""internal pressure"", advisers to Taiwan's China-policy making body said.
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has repeatedly lambasted Beijing over the virus, worsening already poor ties, even as President Tsai Ing-wen and other officials have offered to help China fight the outbreak.
Much of the anger has been focused on China blocking Taiwan's participation at the World Health Organization, with the island accusing China of passing on wrong information to the body about the numbers of infected in Taiwan and of not allowing the island to get the most up to date details on the virus.
While China has denied Taiwan's accusations, it has stepped up military pressure on Taipei. Earlier this month, Taiwan twice scrambled fighter jets to intercept Chinese air force aircraft which approached the island.
Late on Tuesday, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, in minutes from a recent meeting of advisers, said ""popular sentiment"" on both sides of the Taiwan Strait had risen as a result of the virus.
""The academics believe that there is no room for ambiguity across the Taiwan Strait, and suggests the government maintain its current policy position, strive to participate in the WHO and show goodwill to mainland Chinese suffering from the virus,"" the council said.
""Additionally, minor incidents which could touch off a war across the Taiwan Strait should be avoided, that could become a pressure release point for the Chinese Communists to alleviate internal pressure.""
Chinese public opinion believes people in Taiwan lack sympathy about China's virus outbreak, but that is the result of China's previous pressure on the island, the council quoted the unnamed academics as saying.
Tsai's offer in late January to China to provide ""necessary assistance"" to fight the virus should be ""further implemented"", the council said.
""(We) suggest the government continues to reduce the pressure and lower the temperature on the Taiwan Strait issue,"" it added.
China believes Tsai wishes to push for Taiwan's formal independence, a red line for Beijing. She says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
Tsai said on Wednesday she was suspending preparations for the May 20 inauguration ceremony for her second term to help with virus containment work, adding that there would be no large scale event if there were still ""virus misgivings"" then. 
Taiwan has reported 31 cases of the virus and one death, and has largely suspended travel and tourism links with China to curb its spread. 
China has reported more than 78,000 cases and more than 2,700 deaths.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donors and aid groups are planning to suspend humanitarian aid to areas of Yemen controlled by the Houthis in the coming months if the group does not stop hindering the delivery of assistance, a senior U.S. State Department official said on Tuesday. 
Aid agency sources told Reuters earlier this month that Houthi authorities in northern Yemen were obstructing efforts to get food and other help to those in need, to an extent that was no longer tolerable, and that operations would be scaled down.
The senior U.S. State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed those plans. 
""Each donor and implementer is drawing up plans on how to, what to do if the Houthis do not change their behavior on the ground,"" the official said. ""The plans involve suspending a lot of assistance programs with exceptions for truly lifesaving programs feeding sick children and things like that.""
""Everyone's looking at a timeline of a month or two. ... That's the point at which different implementers will start to suspend some of the programs,"" the official said. 
The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's biggest humanitarian crisis and says millions of people are on the verge of starvation. The world body did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it was planning to suspend some operations to Houthi-controled areas. 
Aid agencies have for the past year publicly and privately complained of worsening operating conditions, lack of travel permits and other access restrictions.
""It can't be tolerated anymore,"" the State Department official said. 
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a major donor, said it was extremely concerned that the Houthis had worsened the effects of the crisis by interfering in aid operations.
""We are urgently working on a way forward that allows U.S. aid to continue uninterrupted, but are taking steps to plan ahead with our partners so they can safely and responsibly adjust programming should we be forced to reduce aid,"" said acting USAID spokesperson Pooja Jhunjhunwala.
Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi from the capital Sanaa in late 2014. A Saudi-led military coalition has fought to restore Hadi.
At the United Nations on Tuesday, the Security Council adopted a resolution to extend targeted sanctions and an arms embargo on the Houthis for another year. Thirteen countries voted in favor and Russia and China abstained because they said the text was not balanced.
In the resolution the council expressed ""serious concern at the devastating humanitarian situation in Yemen and all instances of undue hindrances to the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance, including the recent interference in aid operations in Houthi-controled areas.""
The United States and other Western powers have long accused Iran of supplying weapons to the Houthis. Iran has repeatedly denied the accusations.

""Not only does Iran continue supplying weapons to the Houthis, but they are also increasing the sophistication of these weapons,"" U.S. diplomat Rodney Hunter told the Security Council on Tuesday.

Six armed individuals boarded the San Ramon tanker early Monday morning in Pozuelos Bay and shot the captain, Colombian national Jaime Herrera Orozco, a report from the Puerto La Cruz port authority seen by Reuters said.
A coast guard sergeant guarding the ship was also injured, the report added.
Crime has become a growing problem https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-oil-crime-insight/pirates-and-hold-ups-crime-strikes-venezuelas-oil-industry-idUSKBN0P51G020150625 for OPEC member Venezuela's moribund oil industry during a six-year economic crisis, marked by hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods.

He said it was the first time he could recall an attack of this type in eastern Venezuela, and it was the first death at the hands of ""pirates"" he knew of.
""This is a demonstration of the insecurity we face, which is also present in the oil fields and undoubtedly impacted production,"" Bodas said in a telephone interview, adding that other members of the San Ramon's crew were missing.
Authorities have not provided official information about the incident.
Neither Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, nor the country's oil or information ministries responded to requests for comment. Neither the Puerto La Cruz port authority nor Venezuela's INEA maritime authority answered the phone on Tuesday, a national holiday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was in good spirits on Tuesday, as he accepted visitors while under police guard at a Manhattan hospital, his lawyer said, despite having been convicted a day earlier of sexual assault and rape.
Weinstein had been expected to move to New York City's notorious Rikers Island jail complex following the verdict, but was admitted late Monday night to Bellevue Hospital a few miles away.
One of his lawyers, Arthur Aidala, told reporters after meeting with Weinstein that his 67-year-old client ""looked like he was in good shape"" but was ""not a picture of health by any stretch of the imagination,"" and doctors would decide when to release him.
""He was upbeat,"" though ""obviously he prefers being in his own house,"" Aidala said.
Media reports said Weinstein had experienced chest pain or heart palpitations before being admitted to Bellevue, a public hospital.
Aidala said Weinstein was ""somewhat flabbergasted by the verdict"" and ""cautiously optimistic"" about his eventual appeal. ""I almost feel emboldened by Mr. Weinstein's spirits and his desire to continue to fight these charges,"" Aidala added.
Weinstein was convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping former aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013.
Jurors acquitted Weinstein on the two top charges, predatory sexual assault, which carried a maximum life sentence.
Those counts required jurors to consider accusations by the actress Annabella Sciorra, who testified that Weinstein raped her in the early 1990s.
The actress Ellen Barkin, a friend of Sciorra, tweeted on Tuesday: ""Convicted rapist harvey weinstein is still not in jail. He is in a private suite in Bellevue hospital. This is not what the jury had in mind.""
MILESTONE FOR #METOO
Weinstein's guilty verdict was a milestone for the #MeToo movement, which was fueled by his case starting in late 2017.
The movement inspired women to accuse hundreds of powerful men - in entertainment, business, media, politics and other fields - of sexual misconduct.
Weinstein faces up to 29 years in prison, and is scheduled to be sentenced on March 11.
Aidala said he may seek an earlier sentencing date so Weinstein can appeal sooner. New York law requires a defendant to be sentenced first, he said.
He quoted Weinstein as saying after the verdict: ""I'm innocent. I'm innocent. How can this happen in America?""
More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. He has denied the accusations, and said any sexual encounters were consensual.
Weinstein was a key force behind acclaimed films such as ""The English Patient"" and ""Shakespeare in Love,"" which both won Oscars for best picture.
He had been free on bail during the trial, and on Monday morning ate breakfast with his lawyers at an upscale hotel.
HEALTH ISSUES
Weinstein, however, lost that freedom when the trial judge, Justice James Burke of state Supreme Court in Manhattan, ordered he be jailed following the conviction. Court officers led him away in handcuffs.
Aidala said Weinstein was not being handcuffed at Bellevue.
Weinstein was admitted to a unit that provides medical care for inmates.
A spokesman said earlier on Tuesday that Weinstein suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure.
During the trial, the former producer appeared frail and used a walker.
The Rikers Island jail complex, whose main building went up in 1932, has long been plagued by violence and neglect. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio vowed in 2017 to close it within a decade.
Jail officials could place Weinstein in a private or semi-private cell to help ensure his safety.
Weinstein also faces several felony charges in Los Angeles in connection with his alleged sexual assaults against two women in 2013.

His former film studio, Weinstein Co, filed for bankruptcy in March 2018 and is being liquidated.

Britain technically completed its protracted exit from the European Union on Jan. 31, ending more than four decades of alignment with the European project. However, it remains bound by EU rules until the end of 2020 while a new trade deal is thrashed out.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is eager to move on from three years of division over Brexit that toppled his two predecessors, tested the limits of Britain's constitution, and still threatens to tear apart the United Kingdom's constituent countries.
The government said it would conduct the largest review of its kind since the end of the Cold War three decades ago to overhaul Britain's approach to foreign policy. Its findings would set UK priorities and objectives and how to achieve them.
""I am determined to lead a government that delivers for our people - both at home and abroad. The UK’s institutions, expertise, leadership and values are renowned around the world,"" Johnson said in a statement.
""But we cannot rest on our laurels. We must do more to adapt. We will be judged by how we respond to the opportunities ahead.""
At a time of heightened global uncertainty, the continued rise of China as a superpower and U.S. President Donald Trump's disruptive international diplomacy, Britain's 2016 vote to leave the EU has thrown its own role and influence on the world stage into doubt.
The review will take in the standpoints of government departments and draw on outside experts, looking at a range of topics from defense procurement to how data and technology can be used to counter national security threats.
Officials, reporting to the prime minister, will be expected to complete the bulk of their work in time for recommendations to influence a government spending review due later in the year, although full implementation will take several years.
Experts will look for innovative ways to promote British interests while meeting overseas aid and NATO defense spending commitments."

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish left-wing nationalists Sinn Fein demanded a place in Ireland's next government on Tuesday at a packed rally in Dublin, saying the country's two dominant centre-right parties were trying block voters' demand for change. 
Sinn Fein shocked the Irish political establishment in an election earlier this month by securing more votes than any other party for the first time, almost doubling its vote to 24.5% on a vow to fix the country's housing and health systems. 
But it has been frozen out of government talks by centre-right rivals, Fianna Fail and Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael, who have both refused to contemplate sharing power due to policy differences and Sinn Fein's history as the political wing of the Irish Republican Army.
The two parties, who have alternated in power for 100 years, on Tuesday held talks about possibly sharing power for the first time.
""They are doing everything they can to keep people who voted for us out of government,"" Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald told a packed hall of 500 people, with a couple of hundred more waiting in freezing wind outside. ""Sinn Fein wants to be in government and we want to deliver.""
""To the parties that have decided they do not want to speak to us, I say this: We respect your mandate. Now it is time that you respect ours,"" she said.
Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said Sinn Fein does not operate to the same democratic standards held to by every other party and that McDonald had praised units of the IRA.
McDonald, who took over from Gerry Adams in 2018 and has no direct link to the IRA's role in the three decades of violence in Northern Ireland that ended in 1998, rejected the statement and said Martin was ""exuding bile."" 
Varadkar has described the series of rallies Sinn Fein is holding across the country as part of a ""campaign of intimidation and bullying,"" a statement ridiculed by the party. 
Asked if Sinn Fein planned to take their fight to the streets, McDonald said her focus was on talks with other parties. ""The numbers will stand or fall within the Dail (parliament),"" she said. 
Fine Gael won 35 seats in the 160-seat house to the 37 each held by Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein. 
Sinn Fein's best chance of entering government appeared to be a tie-up with Fianna Fail, whose opposition has been slightly softer than that of Fine Gael, but Martin has repeatedly ruled that out. Most observers agree a government between Sinn Fein and several smaller left parties and independent members of parliament is unrealistic. 
All sides predict it will take several weeks to form a government with the risk of a second election if talks fail, with analysts predicting Sinn Fein would be best placed to increase their seat numbers.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A California woman whose family's company created the microwavable snack Hot Pockets was sentenced on Tuesday to five months in prison for paying $300,000 to help her daughters gain an illicit edge in the college admissions process through cheating and fraud.
Federal prosecutors in Boston had sought a 21-month prison term for Michelle Janavs, 49, after she admitted she was among the wealthy parents who took part in the largest college admissions scam ever uncovered in the United States.
But while U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton imposed a lower sentence than prosecutors wanted, her rejected Janavs' request for probation, saying she deserved prison for ""deliberately corrupting the college admissions system.""
Gorton also ordered Janavs to pay a $250,000 fine. In court, Janavs said she was ""so very sorry that I tried to create an unfair advantage for my children.""
Janavs is among 53 people charged with participating in a scheme in which parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of their children to top schools.
William ""Rick"" Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty in March 2019 to charges he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and helped bribe university sports coaches to present his clients' children as fake athletic recruits.
The 36 parents charged since March 2019 include ""Desperate Housewives"" actress Felicity Huffman, who was sentenced in September to 14 days in prison, and ""Full House"" star Lori Loughlin, who is fighting the charges.
Janavs is a former executive at Chef America Inc, a closely-held food manufacturer her father co-founded that created the microwave snack line Hot Pockets before being sold to Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) for $2.6 billion in 2002.
Prosecutors said Janavs paid Singer $100,000 to have an associate take the ACT entrance exam at a test center Singer controlled through bribery in place of her two daughters in order to inflate their scores. 
The associate was Mark Riddell, a Florida private school counselor who has pleaded guilty to taking SAT and ACT college entrance exams in place of Singer's clients' children or correcting their answers while acting as a test proctor. 
Prosecutors said Janavs also agreed to pay $200,000 to facilitate the admission of one of her daughters at the University of Southern (NYSE:SO) California by bribing an athletics official at the school to designate her as a beach volleyball recruit.
USC has since rescinded her daughter's admissions offer.

The SDS formed a majority coalition with the center-left Party of Modern Center (SMC), the conservative New Slovenia and the pensioners' party Desus.
President Borut Pahor is expected to nominate Jansa on Wednesday for the post of prime minister, to replace outgoing center-right Prime Minister Marjan Sarec who resigned last month. Jansa is expected to be confirmed by parliament next week.
The four parties hold 48 out of 90 seats in parliament but one member of the SMC had said he would not support a government led by Jansa.
""The (coalition) negotiations were tough ... but in the end we managed to agree on the basic, key points with which we want to return impetus to Slovenia and turn up its development cycle,"" Anze Logar, a member of parliament and the head of the SDS's council, told reporters.
He said some of the main tasks of the new government will be improving Slovenia's inefficient national health system and presiding over the European Union in the second half of 2021.
Jansa, 61, led the Slovenian government from 2004 to 2008 and from 2012 to 2013. He will have 15 days after being confirmed as prime minister to form a government. Parliament is expected to confirm the new government by the end of March.
Sarec, who led the first minority government in Slovenian history, resigned after 16 months in power because his Cabinet lacked sufficient support in parliament to enforce important legislation.
The next regular election is due in mid-2022.

Yoan Orlando Milian, a 37-year-old who splits his time between Miami and Havana, said he had camped out for days to be the first in line to purchase a car. 
""I will do anything for my family. And this is a good option for my wife and kids in Havana,"" he said from the window of his 2011 Toyota Land Cruiser that he had bought for $80,000 - more than double the amount he might expect to pay in the United States.
Cuba first legalized in 2014 the sale and purchase of cars manufactured after the 1959 revolution, but for convertible Cuban pesos, which are officially valued at a dollar though worthless outside the country. 
The state maintains a monopoly on foreign trade and retail sales.
Previously, the new and used cars were priced at more than four times the factory price. Now available for dollars through use of a bank card, the government says it will discount 10% from the former price as it opens more outlets and makes new vehicles available.
Reinier Ramos, from the central Cienfuegos province, said he had come to Havana three days earlier to stake a claim on a car.
""I want to buy a Geely at $35,000 or MG3 for $34,000,"" he said, referring to two Chinese brands.
Ramos, a civil engineer, said he had sold a car and received money from family abroad for the purchase.
Cuba's state-run economy is going through a liquidity crisis due to the implosion of ally Venezuela's economy and the tightening of the decades-old U.S. trade embargo under President Donald Trump.
The government has opened around 80 ""dollar stores"" selling items such as home appliances and car parts that it has to buy abroad in tradable currencies. The state had previously sold such items for convertible pesos.
Cuban stores continue to sell food and basic household items in convertible pesos or its other currency, the local peso.

VOLKMARSEN, Germany (Reuters) - Germany increased security at some carnival processions on Tuesday after a local man ploughed his car into a parade in the western German town of Volkmarsen, injuring 61 people, including 20 children.
The incident on Monday shook Germans still struggling to take in last week's racist gun attack on two bars in the town of Hanau which left 11 people dead.
The Kassel district court ordered the suspect, a 29-year-old German man, remanded in custody on suspicion of attempted murder, grievous bodily harm and dangerous interference with road traffic, a spokesman for the prosecutor said in a statement.
""The accused is suspected of having deliberately steered his car into a large group of people with the intention of killing on 24 February, 2020 at around 2.45 pm (1345 GMT) during the Rose Monday procession in Volkmarsen,"" the spokesman added.
Rose Monday is the height of the carnival season in Catholic areas of Germany, especially in the Rhineland where tens of thousands of people dress up, drink alcohol and line the streets to watch decorated floats that often mock public figures.
The 61 people injured - some of them seriously - were aged between two and 85. Investigations into the driver's motive were continuing and all possibilities were being investigated, the prosecutor's spokesman added.
While the driver was detained and treated for his own injuries, townspeople puzzled over why he had done it.
""You have to be crazy or blinded by rage to do something like this,"" said 58-year-old Volkmarsen native Rainer Bellmann.
""EMPTY AND DEAD"" GAZE
An emergency responder said bystanders had punched the man while he tried to choke her as she leaned into the car to remove the key after his vehicle crashed.
""He didn't say a word. He looked at you empty and dead and seemed so satisfied,"" Lea-Sophie Schloemer told Welt television. ""It was really unnerving how satisfied he seemed.""
Initial tests for alcohol were negative but that was not a final assessment and there were as yet no results from the drug test, the prosecutors' spokesman said.
While some carnival processions in the state of Hesse, home to Volkmarsen, were canceled, other celebrations in the region went ahead, under increased security.
Prosecutors said there was no concrete reason to think the risk of attacks at parades had increased, but urged organizers to review security arrangements.
Security at public events in Germany has been tightened since a Tunisian man with Islamist militant ties ploughed a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin in 2016, killing 12 people. He was later shot dead by Italian police after fleeing.
A police spokesman said he could not rule out that some of the injured in Volkmarsen were in a life-threatening condition.
The suspect will appear before an investigating magistrate as soon as his condition allows, state prosecutors said.
""There are so far no indications of politically-motivated criminality,"" Bild newspaper cited an investigator as saying.
""But we think that the perpetrator acted with intent, and that psychological problems may have played a role,"" the investigator added.
Prosecutors confirmed that a second man had been detained at the scene on Monday and was accused of filming the incident. The spokesman said prosecutors were investigating whether the man had links to the driver.
The street where the incident happened in the center of the small town was still cordoned off by police on Tuesday and several stores in the area were closed.

Locals told Reuters that police had searched two homes in the town, including one apartment near to the scene that a police officer said was the home of relatives of the man.

Yehry Rivera, a leader of the Broran ethnic group, died of gunshot wounds in the Terraba region, a year after the murder of another indigenous leader in the neighboring Salitre territory, both in Puntarenas province, police said.
The chief suspect is a farmer who turned himself in injured to the authorities hours after the fight with guns and knives broke out, the Ministry of Public Security said.
Rivera was killed during a bid to expel landholders occupying part of the land granted by law to the indigenous population of various ethnic groups, authorities said.
President Carlos Alvarado condemned the killing of Rivera and expressed his regret at the violence in the region.
National indigenous lobby MNICR and the National Front of Indigenous Peoples (Frenapi) accused the government of failing to provide adequate security in the region, and criticized it for allowing their lands to be illegally occupied.
In a statement, Frenapi urged the government to uphold measures ordered in 2015 by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) aimed at protecting the indigenous groups in the Salitre and Terraba territories.
The United Nations representative in Costa Rica, Alice Shackelford, also condemned Rivera's murder and said the rights of indigenous peoples and their land must be respected.
The Broran form part of one of eight indigenous groups that have 24 territories recognized by law in Costa Rica, where 2.4% of the population is considered indigenous, according to a 2011 census."

CAIRO (Reuters) - Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who ruled for 30 years until he was ousted in a popular uprising against corruption and autocracy, died on Tuesday at the age of 91.
A partner of the West in fighting Islamists, Mubarak presided over an era of stagnation and repression at home and was an early victim of the ""Arab Spring"" revolutions that swept the region.
He died in intensive care a few weeks after undergoing surgery. Egypt's presidency and armed forces mourned him as a hero for his role in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and the former air force officer will be given a military funeral.
Three days of public mourning were declared and state television played clips of Mubarak with a black ribbon at the corner of the screen.
Mubarak, who was arrested two months after being forced out by the protesters who crammed into Cairo's Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ) in 2011, spent several years in jail and military hospitals.
He was sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to murder 239 demonstrators during the 18-day revolt, but was freed in 2017 after being cleared of the charges.
He was however convicted in 2015 along with his two sons of diverting public funds to upgrade family properties. They were sentenced to three years in jail.
Egyptians, who often complained about corruption, oppression and unemployment under Mubarak, had mixed feelings about their former leader as news of his death spread.
""We had good and bad memories,"" said Sherin Saad, a woman in her 30s, who criticized graft and the privatization of public firms, which his critics say enriched the elite.
Atef Bayoumi, walking on the Nile Corniche in central Cairo, said: ""He was a patriot. Regardless of the final events, he surely did good things for the country.""
In contrast, Gamal Eid, a prominent human rights activist, said on Twitter: ""My condolences to all tyrants, they lost one today!""
There was no immediate reaction from Western capitals, which had valued Mubarak for preserving a peace treaty with Israel signed by his predecessor Anwar al-Sadat.
""On behalf of Israel’s citizens and government, I wish to express my deepest sorrow over the passing of President Hosni Mubarak,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""President Mubarak, a personal friend of mine, was a leader who led his nation to peace and security.""
The United Arab Emirates' minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, said on Twitter that the Arab world had lost a statesman who took significant national and historic positions.
CRONY CAPITALISM
Mubarak did not leave the country after his overthrow, unlike Tunisia's Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, who fled with his family to Saudi Arabia after being ousted in the first Arab Spring protests.
In contrast, the Mubarak family has stayed in Egypt since 2011 but kept a low profile. 
Mubarak had always maintained his innocence and said history would judge him a patriot who served his country selflessly, but for many Egyptians his time in power was a period of autocracy and crony capitalism. 
His successor, Mohamed Mursi, lasted only a year in office, however, after mass protests in 2013 led to his overthrow by then defense chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is now president.
Mubarak-era figures, meanwhile, are gradually being cleared of charges, and laws limiting political freedoms have raised fears among activists that the old regime is back.
Many Egyptians have credited Sisi for restoring stability, but activists say his relentless crackdown on dissent is worse than anything under Mubarak.
Announcing Mubarak's death, Egyptian TV criticized him for economic mismanagement. New cities he had created in the desert lacked a ""comprehensive vision"" while he had spent billions on new roads which the government later had to repair.

Timothy Kaldas, non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said that the coverage was seeking to highlight corruption under Mubarak to curb nostalgia for his time in power.

Shamkhani did not give details in a tweet reacting to accusations by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday that the Islamic Republic may have withheld information about the spread of coronavirus inside the country.
“Pompeo’s expression of concern about what he deems to be a cover-up by #Iran over #corona comes while no exact news about the truth of #Ain al-Asad...has been published by the White House,” Shamkhani tweeted.
Iran fired a barrage of missiles at the Ain al-Asad airbase in Iraq in early January, a few days after the top Iranian military commander was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Iraq.
The U.S. military has said that more than 100 U.S. soldiers were diagnosed with traumatic brain injury from the Iranian attack while Iranian military officials have said the missile strike killed several American soldiers.
Pompeo said on Tuesday the United States was ""deeply concerned"" Iran may have covered up details about the spread of coronavirus, and he called on all nations to ""tell the truth"" about the epidemic.
Iran's coronavirus death toll rose to 16 on Tuesday, the highest outside China, increasing its international isolation as nations from South Korea to Italy accelerated emergency measures to curb the epidemic's global spread.

Western chocolate companies such as Lindt, Hershey and Ferrero pay a premium for sustainable cocoa made with fair trade certification, buying mainly from multinational companies such as Cargill, Olam and Barry Callebaut.
Domestic exporters, which win a much lower share of those lucrative contracts, have less financial strength to buy cocoa beans - whose price has been inflated by purchases from the multinationals - to service other export contracts.
That means they run the risk of defaulting on their commitments, the GNI said, potentially a huge blow for the Ivorian cocoa market.
Ivory Coast's Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC) lost 300 billion CFA francs ($496.7 million) when locals exporters defaulted or went bankrupt during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons because they could not fund bean purchases to honor their export contracts.
""Eleven of our members are on the edge of bankruptcy and default because they cannot fulfill their (export) contracts,"" said Constance Kouame, GNI's secretary general.
""They cannot buy beans in the face of multinational price competition. We are all helpless.""
GNI members need to acquire another 150,000 tonnes of cocoa beans by the end of the season to avoid default, the association said.
The multinationals are currently stockpiling over 200,000 tonnes of cocoa and are seeking additional export contracts from the CCC, according to the regulator and GEPEX, the body representing cocoa multinationals.
Four managers interviewed by Reuters said that they are waiting to hear back from the CCC.
Middlemen from whom purchases are made say multinational companies, which according to the cocoa regulator control between 75% and 80% of cocoa arrivals and exports in Ivory Coast, buy beans at 975-980 CFA francs per kilo.
That is well above the official price of 905 CFA francs per kilo, although CCC rules prohibit exporters from paying over the official price for beans to maintain healthy competition between exporters.
An Olam Cocoa spokesperson said the company was fully compliant with CCC rules, while Cargill said it complied with all the council's regulations around physical volume. Barry Callebaut did not respond to a request for comment.
CCC rules stipulate that stocks of beans held without export contracts should be sold to exporters who have valid export contracts and are in need of beans.
GEPEX said they are not refusing to sell the surplus beans to other exporters, but have made requests for additional export contracts to the CCC and are awaiting a response.
The CCC declined to comment.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's centrist President Klaus Iohannis will launch fresh consultations to form a government on Wednesday, two days after the constitutional court overturned his re-nomination of ousted Liberal Party leader Ludovic Orban as prime minister.
Legislators toppled Orban's three-month-old minority government earlier this month in a confidence vote spearheaded by the opposition Social Democrats (PSD), the country's largest parliamentary group.
Iohannis promptly called on Orban to form a new government, but the PSD asked the court to block this.
""I will call for fresh consultations with political parties on Wednesday,"" Iohannis told reporters. ""My intention is to give the country a government, we need to unlock this political deadlock.""
The PSD argued a nominee for prime minister must be able to form a functioning parliament majority and Orban, having lost a no-confidence vote, did not meet this condition. The court agreed, urging the president to ""proceed to designate a new candidate for the prime minister job.""
Iohannis' re-nomination of Orban has been seen as a ploy to bring on early elections, as if parliament rejects two successive proposed cabinets within 60 days a snap election is triggered. Orban's party has said it is confident of winning an election.
The PSD would not benefit from an early election. They have lost roughly half their support since winning parliamentary polls in late 2016.
Orban's ousted cabinet is running the country on an interim basis, with limited powers, as widening budget and current account deficits put pressure on assets and rating outlooks.
The Romanian leu dropped to a record low on Monday, partly driven by political uncertainty, and on Romania's longer-term government bonds fell sharply on Tuesday."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - More than a dozen people have been killed and hundreds injured in clashes between opposing groups of protesters in New Delhi, hospital officials said on Tuesday, as riots overshadowed U.S. President Donald Trump's first visit to India.
    The clashes, the worst in the capital since unrest over a new citizenship law began in December, started at the weekend but turned deadly on Monday. Violence erupted again in multiple areas of northeast Delhi on Tuesday, just miles away from where Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met for talks.
India's capital has been a focus of unrest against the Citizenship Amendment Act, which makes it easier for non-Muslims from three neighboring Muslim-dominated countries to gain Indian citizenship.
Local TV channels showed huge clouds of smoke billowing from a tire market that had been set ablaze and Reuters witnesses saw mobs wielding sticks and stones walking down streets in parts of northeast Delhi, amid further incidents of stone-throwing.
India's junior home minister G. Kishan Reddy told Reuters' partner ANI on Monday that the violence was ""a conspiracy to defame India"", at a time when Trump was visiting the country.
Some of those protesting at the citizenship law alleged, however, that Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its supporters were targeting Muslims and instigating the violence.
""We have no weapons, but they are firing at us,” said Mohammad Shakir, a demonstrator opposed to the law. ""This BJP is targeting Muslims. They want to turn India into a Hindu country.""
The Hindu nationalist BJP denies any bias against India's more than 180 million minority Muslims.
Reuters witnesses at a local hospital spoke with both Hindu and Muslim victims, who were injured in the violence on Tuesday. A few victims on both sides of the violence had suffered bullet wounds, and many had visible injuries on their heads and bodies.
An official at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital in New Delhi said 13 people had died there and more than 150 injured had been treated at the hospital, many from bullet wounds.
An official at the Al-Hind Hospital in New Delhi said two men had died and over 200 injured had been treated there.
A fire department official said his teams were responding to more than a dozen calls over arson attacks, despite emergency measures prohibiting any gatherings in the violence-hit areas.
    ""We have sought police protection as our vehicles are being blocked from entering the affected areas. The situation is very grim,"" Delhi Fire Department Director Atul Garg said.
One fire department vehicle was torched by protesters on Monday and a small number of firemen were injured, Garg added.
The joint commissioner of police Alok Kumar said about 3,500 police and paramilitary officers had been deployed.
    Police fired teargas and pellets to scatter demonstrators protesting against the citizenship law in the Jafrabad neighborhood of northeast Delhi on Tuesday. A young man suffered a pellet wound to his thigh, while another sustained injuries to his eyes, leaving his face bloodied.
In New Jafrabad, local residents patrolled the street with sticks and metal rods. 
Two reporters with the local NDTV news channel were attacked and badly beaten by a mob.
    SCHOOLS SHUT, TRANSIT HAMPERED
    On Monday police used tear gas and smoke grenades but struggled to disperse stone-throwing crowds who tore down metal barricades and torched vehicles and a petrol pump.
    Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed for calm.
    ""Whatever problems people have can be resolved peacefully. ""Violence will not help find a solution,"" he said on Tuesday.
India's Home Minister Amit Shah, who met local officials on Tuesday, urged political parties to avoid provocative speeches that could inflame protesters.
But, on Tuesday, after police cleared an anti-government protest site in northeast Delhi, B. L. Santosh, a leader from Shah's party called for a harsh response. ""The game starts now. Rioters need to be taught a lesson or two of Indian laws,"" he said in a tweet.
    Schools in the northeast of the city were shut on Tuesday and at least five metro stations closed.   
    An announcement over a mosque loudspeaker urged protesters to stay non-violent and not attempt to cross police barricades.
    ""We don't have a problem with the police, we are against the government's law,"" the announcer said.
    The Citizenship Amendment Act has sparked accusations that Modi and his BJP are undermining India's secular traditions. Objectors have staged protests and camped out in parts of New Delhi for two months.
    On Monday, Trump praised India as a tolerant country.
    ""India is a country that proudly embraces freedom, liberty, individual rights, the rule of law and the dignity of every human being,"" he told a rally of over 100,000 people in Modi's home state of Gujarat. ""Your unity is an inspiration to the world."""

Slovaks vote for a new parliament on Saturday, and final polls showed Smer's lead shrinking and its coalition partners possibly dropping out of parliament, opening up the opportunity for several opposition parties to form a majority.
Smer, the ruling party for 12 of the last 14 years, has led the country through a period of strong growth in recent years that has helped to improve public finances, although it has pushed off plans to balance the budget.
It has suffered a drop in popularity after an investigative journalist's murder in 2018 stoked public anger over graft.
Several opposition parties have called Smer's step a ""desperate"" attempt ""to buy votes"" and they criticized Smer's move to approve the legislation in a shortened procedure.
Smer pushed the bill through parliament helped by one of its two ruling coalition partners, the nationalist SNS, and some opposition lawmakers, including those from the far-right LSNS.
Smer chairman and former Prime Minister Robert Fico said before the vote that Slovakia could afford the new spending.
""I was prime minister for 10 years, (we can manage the extra expenditure) hands down, with such a tax collection, such a growth pace which is planned,"" he told reporters.
The government abandoned plans last year to balance the budget and sees the 2020 budget running a deficit of 0.49% of gross domestic product.
Under the bill, the elderly will receive an extra monthly pension at the end of the year, while widows, people on disability payments and others will also receive extra cash.
The total cost to the 2020 budget is estimated at 442 million euros and 477 million euros in 2021.
The parliament may vote on two similar bills on Wednesday. Together, doubling child benefits and cancelling highway toll for passenger cars would cost 360 million euros from 2021.
The independent state Council of Budget Responsibility has warned that all the three bills combined could widen the deficit by 0.5% of GDP in 2020 and by 0.8% in the following years.
The public sector deficit could then widen to 1.79% of GDP this year and past the European Union-mandated 3% ceiling in 2022."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The United States is preparing to impose more sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday, in an attempt to choke financing to President Nicolas Maduro's government.
""You will be seeing something on that in the not too distant future,"" Trump told a news conference in Delhi when asked if Washington would impose more sanctions on Venezuela or on Indian firms that buy Venezuelan oil from third parties after imposing sanctions on a trading unit of Russian oil giant Rosneft.
""There could be very serious sanctions,"" he said without giving details. ""You are going to see in a little while. You are asking a question right in the middle of us doing something.""
The United States imposed sanctions last week on Rosneft Trading SA as it emerged as a key intermediary for the sale of Venezuelan oil.
India and China are the important buyers of Venezuelan oil, with India importing about 342,000 barrels per day for Venezuela in 2019, according to tanker data obtained by Reuters.
Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world's biggest refining complex, and Nayara Energy, part-owned by Rosneft, are the only Indian buyers of Venezuelan oil. The two firms had been purchasing Venezuelan oil from Rosneft.
U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams told Reuters on Monday that new sanctions against Venezuela's oil sector will be more aggressive in punishing people and companies that violate them.
Trump said Venezuela had been ""wealthy 15 years ago and very wealthy 20 years ago, the wealthiest in all of Latin America.""
""When you look today they don't have water, they don't have basic food, they have no medicines... We are watching Venezuela very closely. We don't like it, not at all,"" he said.
Since the latest sanctions were announced, Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has shifted several oil cargoes from Rosneft Trading to TNK, another Rosneft affiliate, Reuters reported on Monday, citing internal PDVSA documents.
Rodent's units take Venezuelan oil as repayment for billions of dollars in loans extended to Venezuela in recent years. They also swap Venezuelan crude for imported fuel that the poverty-stricken South American country desperately needs.
Other firms taking Venezuelan oil as repayment of loans or late dividends - including U.S. oil major  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and Spain's Repsol (MC:REP) SA - have not been sanctioned by Washington.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bernie Sanders' surge to the front of the Democratic presidential contest has echoes of Donald Trump's improbable 2016 nomination, according to Republican strategists who tried and failed to stop the man who later won the presidency.
And the window for other Democrats to block the U.S. Senator from Vermont from winning the chance to take on Trump in November is closing fast, they said.
""We're not past the point where another Democrat, or a group of Democrats, could deny Sanders the nomination but we're getting pretty close,"" said Republican strategist Michael Steel, a senior adviser to Jeb Bush in 2016.
Four years ago, Trump's rivals - governors and U.S. senators facing a first-time candidate - held their fire, hoping to secure the businessman-turned-TV-host's supporters when his campaign flared out.
""But the inevitable implosion simply never occurred,"" Steel said.
Comparisons to Trump's unexpected win only go so far. Unlike Trump, Sanders is a veteran politician whose strong performance this election cycle follows the robust challenge he gave Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in 2016.
Yet a similar pattern to Trump's nomination victory has played out in this year's Democratic contest as Sanders, who has often been at odds with the party apparatus, has been propelled into the role of front-runner.
Sanders, a democratic socialist, won early contests in New Hampshire and Nevada, and essentially tied with former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg in Iowa.
During last week's Democratic presidential debate, it was not Sanders but former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg who took the most heat from rival candidates, though the billionaire has yet to compete in a nominating contest.
Democrats will debate again on Tuesday in Charleston, South Carolina, providing an opening for Sanders' rivals to put him in the crosshairs before the state's Saturday primary. [nL1N2AP0HB]
Sanders' rivals are worried.
The Bloomberg campaign warned this month it may be ""all but impossible"" to prevent Sanders from getting a plurality or majority of delegates if he performs as he is projected to do when 14 states and one U.S. territory vote in the Super Tuesday contest on March 3.
Buttigieg's campaign said in a memo last week that Sanders could come out of Super Tuesday with a ""seemingly insurmountable lead"" and ""to stop this outcome, a viable alternative to Sanders needed to emerge.""
'NOT A STRATEGY'
But no candidates have dropped out since Sanders' big Nevada win on Saturday.
    ""It's very hard for these candidates to look in the mirror and take advice they should get out. For some of them, there is no path. They can say 'Oh, if Bernie implodes or lightning hits the debate,' but that's not a strategy, that's a hope,"" said John Weaver, a top strategist for Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich's 2016 presidential bid. ""There is a clear parallel with 2016 and Trump.""
Democratic White House hopefuls are beginning to shift their efforts toward convincing voters that they are better suited to take on Trump in the Nov. 3 general election.
Buttigieg, while campaigning in the Super Tuesday state of Virginia over the weekend, said that Sanders, as a democratic socialist, would hurt other Democrats in U.S. House and Senate races.
At a Sunday rally in Colorado, which also votes on Super Tuesday, Senator Elizabeth Warren tried to draw a contrast with her longtime friend and liberal ally Sanders on Senate procedure, making the case that she was more likely to secure legislative wins.
Bloomberg's campaign is also targeting Sanders ahead of Super Tuesday. One ad released on Monday tied Sanders to the National Rifle Association, which Bloomberg has opposed.

In recent weeks agricultural producers have staged marches across dozens of Spanish towns, blocking main roads for hours in protests that in some cases led to clashes with police. [nL8N2AL4AL]
The protests in Spain are part of a broader pattern of agricultural discontent across the European Union where farming subsidies have emerged as a point of contention in budget negotiations in Brussels.
Under the proposed law, sales contracts would be indexed to production costs, ensuring that farmers do not have to sell at a loss, Agriculture Minister Luis Planas said after the weekly cabinet meeting. Spain's Socialist-led minority coalition government also comprises the far-left Unidas Podemos.
The measures aim to give farmers and ranchers more power in negotiations with supermarkets and large distributors.
The bill aims to limit heavy discounting by supermarkets as retailers will only be allowed to sell below the production cost if the expiration date of a perishable product is close, but they will not be able to pass the loss on to the farmer.
""There is a clear imbalance in the food production chain, the government's aim is to restore balance between all the links and ensure a transparent price system,"" Planas said.
The bill also gives temporary workers in some Spanish regions more grounds to request subsidies.
""The government believes it is possible that prices don't rise (for the consumer) and at the same time that farmers get a fairer price for their products,"" Planas said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is turning to federal courts to force state and local officials to turn over records about immigrants in custody in a novel effort to circumvent so-called ""sanctuary"" policies.
Since mid-January, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) has issued subpoenas to law enforcement agencies in California, Colorado, Connecticut, New York and Oregon seeking information about nearly two dozen suspected immigration law violators, according to the agency.
The inmates had been charged or convicted of crimes that included sexual abuse of a child, manslaughter and burglary, according to ICE.
The legal actions could help ICE obtain a wide range of information on immigrants in jail, including last known address, possible gang affiliations and any disciplinary actions while in custody, according to ICE.
In some cases, the agency requested photos of the immigrants as well. The details could be used by immigration authorities to track down people if they are let out and process them for deportation.
Republican President Donald Trump faces re-election in November and has made his battle against ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions a focus of his campaign for a second term. The ""sanctuary"" label is typically applied to cities and states that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.
Previous efforts by the administration to withhold federal funds from police forces in ""sanctuary cities"" were largely shut down by courts.
But ignoring a subpoena for documents or evidence can result in a fine or jail time, making it difficult for local law enforcement to push back. An ICE spokeswoman said the agency will continue using the strategy if it proves effective.
In recent weeks - as the 2020 presidential campaign heats up - the administration has explored new ways to intensify its fight against Democratic-controlled states and localities that it sees as uncooperative on immigration.
Kris Kobach, a Republican immigration hardliner currently running for a U.S. Senate seat in Kansas, said Trump recognized in 2016 that the sanctuary issue can motivate voters.
""I fully expect the president's campaign to continue making this case,"" Kobach told Reuters.
The most high-profile conflict has been between the Trump administration and New York over a state law that lets immigrants without legal status apply for driver's licenses and limits the sharing of records from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles with federal immigration officials.
In response to the law, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) restricted the ability of New Yorkers to enroll or renew enrollment in certain ""trusted traveler"" programs that allow them to speed through security at airports and other entry points.
The U.S. Department of Justice also filed two anti-sanctuary lawsuits earlier this month and Attorney General William Barr said his department was reviewing further steps to counter uncooperative jurisdictions.
POLITICAL ATTACKS?
The use of subpoenas to wrangle information from resistant states and localities has alarmed some immigration experts and advocates.
Lucas Guttentag, a DHS senior counselor during the administration of former President Barack Obama, says the subpoena power should not be used to coerce state and local governments to participate in Trump's immigration crackdown against their will.
""The use of this subpoena authority seems to be another example of the Trump administration distorting or manipulating the immigration laws to serve political ends,"" he said.
Federal immigration officials previously have used subpoenas to force employers or apartment buildings to hand over records or documents, according to current and former agency officials. But that legal authority was not typically employed against fellow law enforcement agencies, they said.
Chad Sublet, an attorney for the city and county of Denver, which was served subpoenas in January for records on four inmates, said in an email to ICE at the time that the requested information was available to the agency through other means.
""It is clear to Denver that ICE is using these administrative subpoenas for political purposes rather than pursuing a legitimate need,"" he wrote.   
The San Diego County Sheriff's Office - one of the jurisdictions hit with subpoenas - said on Friday that it would provide the information and was legally obligated to do so.
A California state law passed in 2017 limits the ability of state and local officials to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, but San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said that the subpoenas take precedence over the state law.
A spokeswoman for the California attorney general referred a request for comment to the sheriff's office.
The DOJ filed lawsuits in federal courts to compel authorities in Denver and New York City - which initially resisted subpoenas - to hand over records.
A Denver official said it had not complied with the requests. A New York City spokeswoman said it would provide information on two people to U.S. attorneys, but that almost all of the information was either public or already available to ICE."

""The United States is deeply concerned by information indicating the Iranian regime may have suppressed vital details about the outbreak in that country,"" Pompeo told reporters, as he also criticized Beijing for what he characterized as the censorship of media and medical professionals.
""All nations, including Iran, should tell the truth about the coronavirus and cooperate with international aid organizations,"" he said.
Iran's coronavirus death toll rose to 16 on Tuesday, the highest outside China, increasing its international isolation as nations from South Korea to Italy accelerated emergency measures to curb the epidemic's global spread. 
    Believed to come from wildlife in Wuhan city late last year, the flu-like disease has infected 80,000 people and killed 2,663 in China. But the World Health Organization (WHO) says the epidemic there has peaked and has been declining since Feb. 2.
Beijing last week revoked the credentials of three Wall Street Journal correspondents over a column China said was racist, and the United States has said it was considering a range of responses to their expulsion.
Pressed on what steps the Trump administration might take, Pompeo declined to provide any details beyond saying a broad range of options were on the table.
""Expelling our journalists exposes once again the government's issue that led to SARS and now the coronavirus - namely censorship. It can have deadly consequences,"" Pompeo said, referring to the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome.
""If China permitted its own and foreign journalists and medical personnel to speak and investigate freely, Chinese officials and other nations would have been far better prepared to address the challenge"" of coronavirus, he added.

Pompeo said that despite the coronavirus epidemic, the United States planned to move forward and host a special meeting with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Las Vegas in March.

431,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",Israel's Netanyahu seeks settlers' votes with annexation pledge,"By Maayan Lubell
HAR HEMED, West Bank (Reuters) - An election in Israel next week could bring many settlers in the occupied West Bank closer to a long-held goal - annexation of the settlements where they live.
But for hardline settlers, that prize could come with an unacceptable price - the creation of a Palestinian state.
Their dream of consolidating Israel's hold on the West Bank and their nightmare of giving some of it up are both included in the pages of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for the Middle East, announced in January.
Fighting for his political survival in Israel's third election in less than a year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged, if he wins Monday's vote, to apply Israeli sovereignty to the settlements, built on land captured in a war in 1967.
His frequent campaign stops in settlements and promises of de-facto annexation - which Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said would create a fragmented and unviable “Swiss cheese” of a Palestinian state - could draw votes from the far-right.
But Netanyahu's annexation promises do not go far enough for some settlers. They believe God promised the land to their forefathers and want all the West Bank, for which they use the Biblical name Judea and Samaria, not just the settlements.
""Rest assured that we will not stop claiming every single inch of this land when Netanyahu, please God, is elected,"" said Daniella Weiss, a settler leader from Kedumim who helped establish the nearby settlement outpost of Har Hemed.
The provisions of Trump's plan will for the first time be a factor for voters as the contents were announced after Israel's inconclusive elections on April 9 and Sept. 17 last year.
The West Bank's 450,000 settlers, living in more than 250 settlements and outposts among towns where 3 million Palestinians reside, make up only about five percent of Israel's population. But the settler movement is influential, with a high voter turnout, and is powerful within Netanyahu's Likud party.
""PIED PIPER""
Netanyahu goes on trial on March 17 on corruption charges he denies. But opinion polls show Likud inching past the centrist Blue and White party of former armed forces chief Benny Gantz, though neither is likely to win a solid parliamentary majority.
The settlements traditionally vote right-wing, with Likud mainly competing with religious and ultra-religious parties for votes. Every vote could be vital as the last two elections were extremely close -- a single seat in parliament could prove decisive when it comes to coalition-building.
Seeking to shore up settler support, Netanyahu has held almost daily events in settlements, including visiting Ariel on Monday with Trump-appointed U.S. Ambassador David Friedman.
Still, some settlers are skeptical he will make good on his annexation promise.
""He talks about it a lot but something always comes up at the last minute,"" said Yoni Novick, from Karnei Shomron settlement.
Novick, 43, had come to the settlement's pub to listen to a leader of Yemina, a far-right party competing with Likud for the settler vote. Asked for whom he would vote, he said: ""I really don't know.""
Further south, in Maale Adumim, a settlement of more than 40,000 people about 15 minutes drive from Jerusalem, the red-roofed homes, shopping mall, flowerbeds and traffic make it look like many other Israeli cities. But most of the international community regards it and other settlements as a violation of international law.
Israel rejects that view, and is largely backed by the Trump administration.
Maale Adumim's deputy mayor, Guy Yifrach, said he believed there was broad consensus among Israelis that sovereignty should be applied to settlements such as his. He does not believe Gantz would press ahead with annexation if he became prime minister.
""The question is who will advance it, and who will drag his heels. If Netanyahu forms the government he will immediately advance it once he gets U.S. permission,"" he said.
But in Kiryat Arba settlement, settler leader Elyakim Haetzni said anyone supporting Netanyahu was being duped ""like the children following the Pied Piper of Hamelin.""
""Netanyahu says what is good for him at that moment. He saw that people want sovereignty, so he's using it as bait. He wants them to bite at it in order to swallow the idea of a Palestinian state,"" Haetzni said."

Lea-Sophie Schloemer told Welt television she heard screams and jumped out of the way as the car plowed through the crowd and then crashed in the town of Volkmarsen in western Germany, where at least 18 children were among the injured.
When the car, a silver Mercedes-Benz, came to a halt, she ran up to it, opened the driver's door and attempted to take the key out of the ignition.
""Then he grabbed my hair and started to choke me and tried to start the car again, which he didn't manage to do,"" Schloemer said of the driver, adding that she recognized his car.
Three local men then punched the driver to restrain him.
""He didn't say a word. He looked at you empty and dead and seemed so satisfied,"" she said. ""It was really unnerving how satisfied he seemed.""
A friend pulled Schloemer away from the car and she administered first aid to two injured people, a child and an older woman.
""It wasn't an accident, nor was it an attack, but it was what he wanted,"" she said of the driver, who German media named as Maurice P.
""I know just about everyone from Volkmarsen but he is not one of the original Volkmarsen folk,"" Schloemer said, adding that she believed he had moved to the town about two years ago. ""One knows him by sight perhaps. But no more.""
Germany increased security at some carnival processions on Tuesday after Monday's incident in Volkmarsen.
The driver, detained on suspicion of attempted homicide, was being treated for his own injuries. The prosecutors' spokesman said he had not been in a fit state to be questioned overnight, but was not drunk at the time of the incident. Tests for drugs were due in the course of the day.

Rose Monday is the height of the carnival season in Catholic areas of Germany, especially in the Rhineland where tens of thousands of people dress up, drink alcohol and line the streets to watch decorated floats that often mock public figures.

LONDON (Reuters) - British politicians turned a blind eye to the sexual abuse of children and actively covered up allegations over decades, an independent inquiry into historical sex offences in Westminster found on Tuesday.
The inquiry did not find evidence of an organized pedophile network in its examination of the period, covering the 1960s through until the 1990s.
But the report found there ""have been significant failures by Westminster institutions in their responses to allegations of child sexual abuse.""
""This included failure to recognize it, turning a blind eye to it, actively shielding and protecting child sexual abusers and covering up allegations,"" the report’s summary said.
The 173-page report found that several members of parliament in the 1970s and 1980s, including Peter Morrison and Cyril Smith, were ""known or rumored to be active in their sexual interest in children and were protected from prosecution in a number of ways,"" by police, prosecutors and political parties.
Peter Morrison was the private secretary to Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister at the time.
Both Morrison and Smith received knighthoods – a British honors system which awards the title ‘Sir’.
The inquiry found about 30 instances of people’s honors being forfeited after they were convicted for crimes involving sexual abuse.
Margaret Thatcher pushed for a knighthood for Jimmy Savile, which he got in 1990, despite revelations in the media about the TV presenter’s sexual abuse of children, the report said.
The inquiry also discussed the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which campaigned for the public acceptance of pedophilia and for changes in the law to allow adults to have sex with children.
It was accepted by some charities as the voice of an oppressed sexual minority and took part in London’s gay pride march in 1983.
“PIE’s aims were given foolish and misguided support for several years by people and organisations who should have known better… There was a fundamental failure to see the problem and a lack of moral courage to confront it,” the report said.
The inquiry found no evidence that the Home Office funded the campaign group.
Home Secretary Priti Patel hailed the ""strength and courage"" of the victims who testified during the inquiry.
"" (The) government will review this report and consider how to respond to its content in due course,"" she said in a statement.
The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) - of which the Westminster investigation is one strand - is one of the largest and most expensive ever undertaken in Britain.
It began work in 2017 and is expected to take five years to complete."

TOKYO (Reuters) - As Tokyo prepares to greet overseas visitors to the Olympic Games in July, some city residents are upset about the more than 100 low-flying jetliners a day that will bring them to the city.
From March 29, whenever a southerly wind blows over Japan's capital, 45 passenger planes an hour will descend low over Tokyo on two new airport approach routes for up to three hours. They will fly as low as 300 meters (1,000 feet) above neighborhoods near the city's Haneda airport. 
""There's a lot of risk and little merit, few residents are happy,"" said Kiwami Omura, who heads the Haneda Problem Solving Project, a group trying to unite opposition groups in Tokyo's 23 wards. He said the government ""is using the Olympics to push this plan, but the flights will continue when it's over"".
The approach routes are part of a renewed push to expand air access to the world's biggest metropolitan area. Aviation officials have struggled for decades to increase capacity in the face of fierce opposition to airport construction, including Tokyo's other airport 80km (50 miles) away at Narita. 
Giving impetus to a new aviation plan that will increase flights to Tokyo by a third to a million a year is part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's drive to make inbound tourism an economic priority. 
Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike also wants to make her city more globally competitive as the rest of Japan struggles with population decline. 
The new approach routes over central Tokyo will add 39,000 flights a year and, the government says, help boost Japan's economy by around $6 billion. Japan Airlines Co Ltd, ANA and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are among the airlines to most benefit from the increase in landing slots.
To open up the routes Japanese aviation officials had to gain permission from the U.S. military for commercial jets to pass through a portion of restricted airspace that surrounds Yokota Air Base in Western Tokyo. 
Abe's government in August said it had ""gained the understanding"" of Tokyo residents. Yet, lawmakers in Tokyo's Shinagawa ward close to Haneda continue to oppose the plan, asking for more stringent noise and safety measures and a commitment to vary the routes. 
""I believe the decision ignores what residents want,"" Jin Matsubara, an independent lawmaker in Japan's parliament, said ahead of a meeting with opposition group representatives. ""My constituency is close to Haneda and the effect from noise and falling objects could be significant.""
Syota Suyama, an official at the Ministry of Land Infrastructure, Transport, said; ""We are aware that we still need to reassure people.""
Omura and other activists will next month attempt to gather at least 7,000 signatures from Shinagawa residents, enough to allow them to ask the ward assembly to approve a referendum. 
""Our aim is to get around 30,000, because that would show assembly members how much opposition there is,"" said Omura.
Any referendum vote that rejected the new Haneda routes would not, however, be enough to reverse the decision.

""Residents don't have power to halt it, the right to make that decision belongs with the transport minister,"" Suyama said.

HASANKEYF, Turkey (Reuters) - Every day hundreds of people gather on the banks of the Tigris river in southeast Turkey to watch a 12,000-year-old town disappearing before their eyes.
Rising water levels from the giant Ilisu Dam further downstream are slowly submerging the town of Hasankeyf and flooding an area which was settled by humans for millennia.
The dam, approved by the Turkish government in 1997 to generate electricity for the region, will uproot nearly 80,000 people from 199 villages and has alarmed authorities in neighboring Iraq, who fear the impact on their water supplies from the Tigris.
After years of setbacks, the dam started filling last July. Water levels in and around Hasankeyf have already risen some 15 meters and continue to rise by around 15 centimeters per day.
The dam forms a key part of Turkey's Southeastern Anatolia Project, designed to spur economic growth in its poorest and least developed area.
Residents have left Hasankeyf, many of them moving to a new town, Yeni Hasankeyf, on a nearby hill which will sit on the shores of a newly created lake once the dam is completely filled.
For now, they can see the stone pillars of an ancient bridge which once spanned the Tigris, and the concrete arches of its modern equivalent, both being slowly subsumed.
Dirt has been piled at both ends of the modern bridge, which leads into Hasankeyf, to prevent entry to the town. Village guards wait at the end of it.
The water has crept up on the shores of the town near the end of the bridge, swallowing some houses. Sections of roads in the town are also under water.
Reuters was turned away from another entrance to Hasankeyf by police who said only residents moving their last belongings and people with permission from local authorities could enter.
Once the dam is filled, proposed plans for the area include ferries shuttling tourists between the new town to a section of the old town that will remain above the water. Several historical structures including a massive tomb, an ancient Turkish bath, a historic mosque and its minaret, have already been moved to Yeni Hasankeyf.
The Ilisu Dam will generate 1,200 megawatts of electricity, making it Turkey's fourth-largest dam in terms of energy production.
Below the historic Hasankeyf fortress, where Romans, Mongols and Seljuk Turks fought or settled, a canyon that housed hundreds of caves in which people lived and worked has been filled with concrete some 50 meters of depth.
A waterway was constructed on top of the concrete to drain the rain water into the dam. Further above the waterway, shepherds still take their herds to graze on top of steep cliffs.
'DUSTY BEAUTIFUL CAVES'
The dam is now 20-25% full, according to the Hasankeyf Coordination group, and the water will likely rise around another 50 meters in coming months, reaching just below the top of the fortress and submerging thousands more caves.
Eyup Agilday, a 27-year-old shepherd, recently moved to the new town. He still visits the old village everyday to take care of his sheep, which he left behind because there is no land for farming and husbandry in the new town.
""When I see Hasankeyf being left under water, I am torn up inside. We have memories there but our history is there as well. We are talking about 12,000 years,"" he said, adding that around five families were still coming to the town to take care of their animals, which they still keep in caves.
Ramazan Sevik, originally from the nearby village of Gercus, came with his two children to visit the town before it is submerged.
""We saw the history here but our children didn't see those dusty beautiful caves. They'll only a see a version of it with make-up,"" the 45-year-old said, sitting at a cafe on the banks of the Tigris that will be submerged in the coming weeks.
""Those who opposed (the project) were accused of being political. Even if you're an environmentalist, a patriot, or animal lover, they labeled you as something else when you said 'Stop!' to the project,"" he said.
""Now, we're watching history slowly disappear."""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - At least seven people were killed and around 150 were injured in clashes between opposing groups in the Indian capital, a police official told Reuters on Tuesday, the deadliest riots in the city since protests against a new citizenship law began over two months ago.
""Seven persons, including one head constable of Delhi police, have died,"" said Anil Mittal, a police officer, adding around 150 persons were injured in the violence on Monday. 
The clashes erupted in a northeastern district of the city between thousands of people demonstrating for and against the new citizenship law. Police used tear gas and smoke grenades, but struggled to disperse the stone-throwing crowds that tore down metal barricades and set vehicles and a petrol pump alight.
""Some of the people brought in had gunshot wounds,"" said Dr Rajesh Kalra, additional medical superintendent at the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital in New Delhi.
Tensions in parts of the city remained high on Tuesday with schools remaining shut in some areas amid news reports of fresh clashes. At least five metro stations in the city were closed.
A fire department official told Reuters that its teams were responding to reports of at least eight separate cases of arson on Tuesday, linked to fresh protests in the city. One department vehicle was also torched by protesters on Monday, and a small number of firemen were injured in the violence, he added. 
The violence on Monday began just as U.S. President Donald Trump began his maiden visit to India. Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are set to meet for talks on Tuesday at a venue located a few miles away from where the clashes occurred.
At a press conference early on Tuesday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed for people to maintain peace, ""Whatever problems people have can be resolved peacefully,"" he said. ""Violence will not help find a solution.""
India's Home Minister Amit Shah is expected to meet Kejriwal and police officials on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the situation. 
India's capital has been a hotbed of protests against the new Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which eases the path of non-Muslims from three neighboring Muslim-dominated countries to gain Indian citizenship.
This has led to accusations that Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are undermining India's secular traditions. The BJP denies any bias against India's more than 180 million-strong Muslim minority, but objectors have been holding protests and camping out in parts of New Delhi for two months.
The violence erupted even as Trump was praising India as being a tolerant country.

""India is a country that proudly embraces freedom, liberty, individual rights, the rule of law, and the dignity of every human being,"" Trump said while addressing a rally of more than 100,000 people in Modi's home state of Gujarat. ""Your unity is an inspiration to the world.""

OSLO (Reuters) - A vault in the Arctic built to preserve seeds for rice, wheat and other food staples will contain one million varieties with the addition on Tuesday of specimens grown by Cherokee Indians and the estate of Britain's Prince Charles.
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, built on an Arctic mountainside in 2008, was designed as a storage facility to protect vital crop seeds against the worst cataclysms of nuclear war or disease and safeguard global food supplies.
Dubbed the ""doomsday vault"", the facility lies on the island of Spitsbergen in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, halfway between Norway and the North Pole, and is only opened a few times a year in order to preserve the seeds inside.
On Tuesday 30 gene banks will deposit seeds, including from India, Mali, Peru and the Cherokee Nation in the United States, which will bank samples of maize, bean and squash.
The Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew in Britain will bank seeds harvested from the meadows of Prince Charles' private residence, Highgrove, including from grass species, clovers and broad-leaved flowering herbs.
The vault also serves as a backup for plant breeders to develop new varieties of crops. The world used to cultivate around 7,000 different plants but experts say we now get about 60% of our calories from three main crops - maize, wheat and rice - making food supplies vulnerable if climate change causes harvests to fail.
""The seed vault is the backup in the global system of conservation to secure food security on Earth,"" Stefan Schmitz, executive director of the Crop Trust, the Bonn-based organization which manages the vault, told Reuters.
""We need to preserve this biodiversity, this crop diversity, to provide healthy diets and nutritious foods, and for providing farmers, especially smallholders, with sustainable livelihoods so that they can adapt to new conditions.""
Already, one in nine people go to bed hungry globally, according to the United Nations' World Food Programme, and scientists have predicted that erratic weather patterns could reduce both the quality and the quantity of food available.
The vault was last opened in October. With Tuesday's deposit, it will contain one million different kinds of seeds, from almost all nations.
In 2015, researchers made a first withdrawal from the vault after Syria's civil war damaged a seed bank near the city of Aleppo. The seeds were grown and re-deposited at the Svalbard vault in 2017.
In October, Norway completed an $11 million, year-long upgrade of the vault, which was built at Svalbard because the Arctic's cold climate means its contents will stay cool even if the power fails. But even the doomsday vault has been affected by likely climate change as an unexpected thaw of permafrost when it first opened let in water to the tunnel entrance of the vault building, although no seeds were damaged."

But when a very public assassination thrust the former bomber pilot into the job, he made it his mission never to give it up.
His story became Egypt's story for the next 30 years until, finally, his people found they could write it themselves, in a 2011 Arab Spring revolution that consigned him to history.
An unremarked vice president to Anwar Sadat, he was a stopgap in the anxious days of 1981 after Sadat was gunned down beside him at a military parade. Few thought he would last.
Yet slowly, surviving attempts on his own life, he became ""Pharaoh"", presiding over decades of stagnation and oppression and offering his people a choice: Mubarak or mayhem.
Many believed him, not just in Egypt. U.S. administrations showered him - and the biggest army in the Middle East - with billions of dollars in gratitude for his loyalty to Sadat's Cold War switch of allegiance and peace with Israel.
But it was his struggles with the Islamists - who by killing Sadat handed power accidentally to a man who would spend 30 years suppressing them - which defined his politics.
Yet to the question of how Egyptians should be governed in the future, he never had an answer beyond ""Mubarak"" and always refused to indicate a successor. Washington expected him to go on rigging elections till he died, when his son Gamal might take over.
""Nobody imagines that we can press a button and freedoms will arrive. Otherwise it would lead the country to chaos and that would be a danger to people,"" Mubarak once said.
Mubarak died aged 91 on Tuesday after undergoing surgery, state television said. 
HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
Mubarak was a 24-year-old air force pilot when the military overthrew King Farouk in 1952.
The son of a government clerk, he was born Muhammed Hosni El Sayed Mubarak in the Nile Delta village of Kafr Musailha on May 4, 1928, when Egypt was still heavily supervised by Britain, which controlled the Suez Canal.
Details of his early life are sketchy. He qualified as a pilot in 1950 and spent more than two years in the Soviet Union a decade later, training to fly bombers.
When much of the air force was wiped out by Israeli warplanes in the Six-Day War of 1967, he was made head of the air force academy, charged with rebuilding air power to hit back. As head of the air force from 1972, he did just that, attacking Israel in 1973.
Sadat, who succeeded Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1970, saw in Mubarak a loyal subordinate and made him vice president in 1975.
That office would lie vacant under Mubarak, who guarded his power jealously.
As president, Mubarak sent the army in to quell mutineers in the 1980s, and also repaired relations with Arab states after Sadat's peace with Israel. In 1989, Egypt was readmitted to the Arab League, which moved its headquarters back to Cairo.
American money made sure that Egypt never wavered from an arms-length civility toward the Jewish state, and Mubarak played mediator between Israel and the Palestinians down the years.
His policies irritated many in the Middle East. After Hamas Islamists took control in the Gaza Strip, adjacent to Egypt, in 2007, Mubarak backed the Israeli blockade of the territory. 
Violence by Islamists at home, including attacks on tourist sites and Red Sea resorts, remained a justification for the police state. In 1995, Mubarak survived one of several assassination attempts when Islamist gunmen fired on his car during a visit to Ethiopia. 
A command economy fashioned under the Arab socialist Nasser lagged behind countries Egypt was once compared to, such as Turkey or South Korea. Egypt's population almost doubled under Mubarak, but many remained mired in deep poverty.
A spurt of growth in his final decade, fuelled by market reforms overseen by his son Gamal, made some rich, but corruption ensured the wealth stuck to the elite around the head of state, the military and those who found favour in the National Democratic Party (NDP).
Politically, there was talk of reform, not least when former U.S. President George W. Bush was pushing the idea. After winning a series of single-candidate referendums that provided the legal basis of his rule, Mubarak agreed to contest a presidential election in 2005. But the defeat of Ayman Nour, a liberal lawyer who dared challenge him, was no surprise.
REVOLUTION
By 2010, the NDP felt confident enough of its impunity to claim 90% of the seats in a parliamentary election that saw the Muslim Brotherhood eliminated from the legislature. 
The resulting public outrage might have subsided, as it had before, had it not been for the sudden success of an uprising in Tunisia just a few weeks later which also prompted protests against Egypt's ruler.
At first, Mubarak gave little ground to the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in Cairo's Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ), comforted by hesitation in Western capitals to cut loose an ally.
Only when his generals began to desert him, fearful their own privileges might be swept away, and the Americans sided with the popular will, did he relent, at first insisting he would retire only later but finally flown off to his Red Sea retreat.
""Egypt and I shall not be parted until I am buried in her soil,"" he said. He was arrested two months later. 
A trial began in August 2011, the sight of Mubarak in a courtroom cage captivating viewers.
On June 2, 2012, just before Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Mursi won the presidency, Mubarak was jailed for life for conspiring to murder protesters, sent to Cairo's Tora Prison though occasionally moved to the smart Maadi military hospital nearby due to claims of failing health.
Prison time would be short, however, as another military man, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, overthrew Mursi the following year.
As Sisi launched a crackdown on the Brotherhood that critics said was more severe than anything under Mubarak, the case against the former president was dropped in 2014. 

Three years later, following an appeal by the prosecution, Egypt's top appeals court acquitted him, allowing him to return to his home the upscale Cairo neighbourhood of Heliopolis, not far from the presidential palace he had occupied for nearly three decades.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Two more people infected with the new coronavirus have died, taking the toll in Iran to 16, officials said on Tuesday, as Iranians worried that authorities could be underestimating the scale of outbreak.
Iran has the highest number of deaths from coronavirus outside China, where the virus emerged in late 2019. Among the infected was the deputy health minister, who tested positive for coronavirus, state media said.
""Among those who had been suspected of the virus, 35 (new cases) have been confirmed and two died of the coronavirus infection,"" said Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpour. He said 95 people had been infected across Iran.
Jahanpour put the death toll at 15, but later Iran's state news agency said one person infected by the virus had died in the city of Saveh. Some unconfirmed reports gave a higher death toll.
The outbreak in Iran has coincided with mounting U.S. pressure on Iran's clerical rulers that has hit the economy hard. In 2018, the United States exited Tehran's nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed sanctions on the country.
Worried that official numbers could underestimate the scale of Iran's outbreak, many Iranians took to social media to accuse authorities of concealing facts.
Popular anger has been high for months over the handling of a Ukrainian passenger plane crash in January, which the military took three days to admit was caused by an Iranian missile fired in error.
The incident revived anti-government protests that rocked the country in November against a hike in fuel prices, which swiftly turned political with calls for Iran's rulers to step down, before authorities cracked down.
The head of Qom's Medical Science University, Mohammad Reza Ghadir, expressed concern over ""the spread of those people infected by the virus across the city"", adding the Health Ministry had banned releasing figures linked to the coronavirus.
""STAY AT HOME""
Authorities ordered the nationwide cancellation of concerts and soccer matches and the closure of schools and universities in many provinces, and have urged Iranians to stay home.
Iran said on Monday 900 cases were suspected, dismissing claims by a lawmaker from the holy Shi'ite city of Qom who said 50 people had died in the city, the epicenter of the new coronavirus outbreak.
""It is an uninvited and inauspicious visitor. God willing we will get through ... this virus,"" said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in a televised speech.
Iran, which confirmed its first two deaths last week in Qom, has yet to say how many people it has quarantined, but the semi-official Mehr news agency said 320 people had been hospitalized.
The virus outbreak threatens to isolate Iran further, with several countries suspending flights after coronavirus cases in travelers from Iran were confirmed in Canada, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan and Iraq.
Some neighboring countries closed their borders. The United Arab Emirates state media said Dubai International Airport had suspended all flights to and from Iran.
Oman's Khasab port is suspending the import and export of goods to and from Iran from Feb. 26 because of the coronavirus outbreak, operator Marafi said on Twitter.
Six Arab countries reported their first cases, with those infected all having links to Iran. Kuwait said on Tuesday the number of infected people there had risen to eight. Bahrain said it had eight cases, four were Saudi nationals and two Bahrainis."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU institutions have ordered staff who travelled to areas of northern Italy hit by an outbreak of coronavirus to stay at home for two weeks, a measure that may be repeated by member states as concerns mount over the epidemic in Europe.
The number of cases in Italy, the country in Europe worst affected by the outbreak that first emerged in China, rose to more than 260 overnight from 229 on Monday, with the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto being the most affected. The number of deaths was unchanged at seven.
Under European Union rules, travel restrictions are decided by each of the 27 member states, but the bloc's institutions can issue warnings to their staff.
The European Parliament ordered a 14-day quarantine for all its staff who travelled to Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, the industrial and financial heartland of Italy, according to an email sent on Monday evening.
Separately, the European Commission told its staff to stay at home for two weeks only if they had visited over the past 14 days any of 11 designated towns in northern Italy that are considered the epicentre of the outbreak there.
The EU executive arm also recommended that its staff avoid travel to Lombardy, a spokesman said on Tuesday.
Among member states, only France has so far imposed quarantine measures on people returning from affected areas in northern Italy, according to an EU document.
TRAVEL ADVICE
The document, adopted after a meeting of EU health experts on Monday, said several member states were revising their travel advice to Italy.
At that meeting, Italian representatives said they would inform their counterparts on the spread of the epidemic and other developments, ""in particular regarding the situation in ski resorts in the Alps"".
EU countries can suspend a border-free pact, known as the Schengen agreement, in the event of emergencies. But so far, none have notified the Commission of any such move, a spokeswoman for the EU executive said on Tuesday.
The EU Parliament advised its staff returning from northern Italy to ""stay home in self-isolation"" and take their temperature twice daily for 14 days. Only after that period, if healthy, they could return to work.
The parliament's advisory also concerned staff who travelled to China, Singapore and South Korea.
So far, the only travel advisory adopted by EU institutions had been a notice from the Commission to its staff at the end of January to suspend ""non-essential"" travel to China."

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Top samba ""schools"" in Brazil's Carnival (NYSE:CCL) capital Rio de Janeiro paraded for a second night on Monday, peppering the annual sizzling fusion of music, dance and costume with jabs at the country's President Jair Bolsonaro.
The last six of the city's 13 top samba schools took to the ""sambodromo"", or Sambadrome, with hundreds of colorfully dressed and some scantily clad dancers and musicians parading behind huge, elaborate floats designed around a broad theme.
Monday's parades, which ran well into the early hours of Tuesday, touched on many themes, among them Bolsonaro, who has cut a controversial and divisive figure since being sworn into office in January last year.
Brazilian actor and comedian Marcelo Adnet starred in the Sao Clemente school's parade dressed up as Bolsonaro, mockingly doing push ups, saluting, and firing an imaginary gun with his fingers, all of which the ex-army captain has done in public during his presidency.
The Sao Clemente float also displayed placards with the words ""It's OK?!"", a popular Bolsonaro phrase, and ""It was Leonardo di Caprio"", a reference to Bolsonaro blaming the Hollywood actor for the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest fires last year.
Since Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, Brazilians have been sharply divided, with supporters crediting him for a rapid drop in violent crime and an improving economy, while critics have denounced his racism, sexism and stance on the environment.
On Sunday the famed Mangueira samba school took aim at the national rise in right-wing religious fervor and surge in police violence, in Rio in particular, in Bolsonaro's first 14 months.
Mangueira's song included a line about ""No messiah with a gun in his hand"", a reference to Bolsonaro, whose middle name is 'Messias' and who advocates more widespread gun ownership.
The costumes, floats and choreography of Rio's samba school may change, but they are always sparkling and spectacular, often taking all year and over $2 million to put together.
Each year the top 13 samba schools parade through the Sambadrome in front of up to 90,000 locals, tourists and VIPs partying in the steep, concrete stands and hospitality suites that line the 700-meter (2,300-ft) venue.
The judges' verdicts are announced on national television on Ash Wednesday.
The 90,000-capacity Sambadrome was designed by revered architect Oscar Niemeyer and constructed in 1984."

The legislation would make products such as tampons and sanitary pads free for all women in Scotland, available at designated public places such as community centers, youth clubs and pharmacies.
The plan is expected to pass its first vote in the devolved Scottish parliament on Tuesday.
The Period Products (Free Provision) Scotland Bill was proposed by Scottish lawmaker Monica Lennon, who first submitted a draft proposal in 2017. The cost is expected to be around 24.1 million pounds ($31.24 million).
""These are not luxury items. They are indeed essential and no one in Scotland should have to go without period products,"" Lennon said, adding that the bill was about ""period dignity"".
""We are changing the culture and it's really exciting that other countries right around the world are watching very closely to see what we do,"" she said.
A consultation document proposed modeling the scheme on the card-based system for free condoms, where users register for a free card or voucher to exchange for the products.
Scotland in 2018 was the first government in the world to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities.
Sanitary products in the United Kingdom are currently taxed at 5% - the so-called ""tampon tax"". Former Prime Minister David Cameron's government said it wanted to end the unpopular tax but that its hands were tied by European Union rules which set tax rates for certain products.
The government announced it would drop the tax in 2016, but this has not happened yet, the issue having been pushed to the sidelines during the Brexit process.
There is no tax on period products in Ireland, Canada, Australia, Kenya, India, Columbia, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Jamaica, Nigeria, Uganda, Lebanon and Trinidad and Tobago, the Scottish government's briefing on the bill said.

ANKARA/AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian rebels backed by the Turkish military have seized the town of Nairab in northwest Syria's Idlib province, Turkish and rebel officials said on Tuesday, the first area to be taken back from advancing Syrian government forces.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, supported by Russian air power, are trying to retake the last large rebel-held region in Syria after nine years of war. Nearly a million Syrians have been displaced by the latest fighting.
Turkey has responded by sending thousands of troops and equipment into the region to support the rebels in resisting the offensive.
""With the help of our Turkish friends, we have regained control of the strategic town of Nairab, the gateway of Saraqeb, after expelling the terrorist Russian militias,"" Yusef Hamoud, spokesman for the Turkish-backed National Army, said.
A Turkish security official said the Turkish military had supported the rebel offensive with shelling and that bomb disposal teams and the rebels were now clearing the town, located about 12 miles (20 km) southeast of rebel-held Idlib city.
Their next goal was to capture the strategic town of Saraqeb, where Syria's main north-south highway linking Damascus and Aleppo meets the road west to the Mediterranean.
""This will happen soon. The regime suffered heavy losses in the clashes last night. Also, a serious amount of weapons and ammunition was seized,"" the Turkish official told Reuters.
He said there had been no clash between Turkish and Russian forces in Monday's advance on Nairab and that no Turkish soldiers had lost their lives in the clashes.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish Defence Ministry said Syrian government forces briefly abandoned Nairab as the Turkish-backed rebels advanced on the town. However, the rebels were subsequently pushed back from the area.
Since Turkey poured its forces into northwest Syria to halt the Syrian government forces' campaign, 17 members of the Turkish forces have been killed.
The fighting has strained ties between Turkey and Russia, which although backing opposing sides in Syria's conflict had worked to contain the violence until the latest flare-up. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said there was not yet full agreement on holding a proposed March 5 summit with Russia, France and Germany on the Idlib conflict, but he may meet Russia's Vladimir Putin on that date.
At a news conference in Ankara before leaving on a trip to Azerbaijan, Erdogan said that a Russian delegation was set to come to Turkey on Wednesday to discuss the situation.
""There is no full agreement yet between (French President Emmanuel) Macron...(German Chancellor Angela) Merkel, and Putin,"" he said. Macron and Merkel have both urged Putin to end the conflict, concerned about the humanitarian situation.
On Saturday, Erdogan said Turkey had set out a ""road map"" for Syria after calls with the three leaders, while the Kremlin has said it was discussing the possibility of holding a four-way summit.
Turkey has already taken in about 3.7 million Syrian refugees and says it cannot handle another wave. It has closed its borders.
Syrian government forces are advancing closer to the camps for displaced persons near the Turkish border, where the migrants fear being caught up in the fighting.
In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) called on the warring sides to allow safe passage for civilians to escape attacks. It reminded them that hospitals, markets and schools are protected by law.
""We are urging parties to allow civilians to move to safety, either in areas they control or across the front lines,"" ICRC spokeswoman Ruth Hetherington told a news briefing.
Most of the displaced are cramming in to pockets of territory near the Turkish border. Bitter winter weather has made their plight more desperate, with many camping by roads or in fields due to the lack of shelter. 
""We urge all parties to provide access and security guarantees so we can adequately respond to the needs of people on both sides of the front lines,"" Hetherington said.
The Syrian Observatory, a war monitor, said on Monday that pro-Damascus forces had seized control of 10 more towns in southern areas of Idlib province in less than 24 hours.
The government offensive could mark the final chapter of a war that has killed an estimated 400,000 people, made millions refugees, and devastated whole cities since an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad broke out in March 2011.

""We have decided to open an investigation after media reports of the insane prices fetched up by these products on online sales websites in the last two days,"" Milan deputy chief prosecutor Tiziana Siciliano told Reuters.
Italy has seen the biggest outbreak of the disease in Europe, with more than 260 cases and seven deaths reported, most in the prosperous north of the country.
Many pharmacists say they have run out of hygienic masks and hand sanitizers and many people have turned to online sites where prices have shot up.
""The price of masks online has risen from one cent to 10 euros each and a one liter bottle of disinfectant that last week was on sale for 7 euros, was up to 39 euros yesterday,"" Siciliano said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Dmitry Yazov, a former Soviet defense minister who took part in an unsuccessful coup against leader Mikhail Gorbachev, died on Tuesday at the age of 95, the Russian Defence Ministry said.
Yazov was the last Marshal of the Soviet Union and one of eight senior officials who tried and failed to remove Gorbachev from power in August 1991, a move widely seen as hastening the collapse of the Soviet Union that same year.
He spent 18 months in jail for his role in the coup before being given an amnesty by then President Boris Yeltsin.
Russian President Vladimir Putin called Yazov ""an outstanding military leader,"" after the Defence Ministry announced his death after a long illness.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who earlier this month bestowed him with a state award, called Yazov a legendary figure.
Yazov, a Siberian-born veteran of World War Two, held the post of Soviet defense minister from May 1987 until August 1991.
During a career that spanned half a century, he was posted to Cuba during the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis with the United States, commanded Soviet forces in then Czechoslovakia in 1979-80, and carried out missions in Afghanistan in the 1980s.
Lithuania last year found Yazov guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in a 1991 crackdown against the Baltic state's pro-independence movement, which killed 14 civilians and wounded more than 700 others.
Russia refused to cooperate with the trial, calling it illegal and Gorbachev declined to testify.
A Lithuanian court sentenced Yazov to 10 years in prison in absentia, in a judgment Russia condemned as an unfriendly and provocative act."

Palestinian and foreign opponents of the construction plan for the E-1 area in the West Bank had cautioned that Israeli housing in the corridor's barren hills could bisect the West Bank, cut off Palestinians from Jerusalem and further dim their hopes for a contiguous state.
""I have given instructions to immediately publish for deposit the plan to build 3,500 housing units in E-1,"" Netanyahu said, using an administrative term for the first phase of a planning process.
""This had been delayed for six and a half years,"" he said in a speech, six days before a national election in which the right-wing Likud party leader is seeking to shore up backing from settlers and their supporters.
The E-1 plan would expand the large Jewish settlement of Maale Adumim, effectively connecting it to Jerusalem, about a 15-minute drive away.
On Feb. 20, Netanyahu announced he was reviving a project to build 3,000 new settler homes at Givat Hamatos in the West Bank, on the outskirts of Jerusalem.

Palestinians and much of the world view Israel's settlements in the West Bank, captured in the 1967 Middle East war, as illegal under international law. The United States and Israel dispute this.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - To escape the confines of his Hong Kong ""coffin home"", or two square meters (21.5 square feet) of living space, Simon Wong usually spends his days in the park playing mahjong with friends, only returning at night to sleep.
But since the Chinese-ruled city reported its first patient with coronavirus last month, Wong has been stuck indoors in the home he has to climb a ladder to get into and which is just large enough to hold a single mattress.
""I don't go out anymore, there are no more gatherings,"" said the unemployed 64-year-old.
""As soon as I finish my tea and grocery shopping, I come home and become a recluse and just watch TV. I can't do anything.""
Two people have died so far from over 80 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Hong Kong. Wong, whose family cut contact with him many years ago, cannot afford face masks or hand sanitizers and feels particularly at risk, even more so than during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in the city in 2003.
""During SARS I didn't even wear one mask, I was even working then,"" he recalls. ""I lived in a place like this, with even more open space, 30 people and not one wore a mask.""
The Asian financial hub has one of the world's highest inequality rates, with more than a million of its population of nearly 7.4 million living below the poverty line. More than 200,000 people are housed in subdivided flats, commonly referred to as ""coffin homes"" because they are so small, government data shows.
Wong has lived in such accommodation for the past two decades, occasionally working as a waiter or security guard.
His current abode is one of 18 plywood ""coffin homes"" in a dusty subdivided apartment in Hong Kong's most densely populated neighborhood, Mong Kok. An improvised shelf holds his TV and groceries, while his clothes and other necessities hang on hooks around him.
The rent takes up two-thirds of the roughly HK$3,000 ($385) he receives in social benefits. The rest pays for two meals a day, often rice and pork.
For anything else, he improvises, refilling his sanitizer at public clinics or the mainland immigration office where it is offered to visitors for free, and wearing face masks for consecutive days to make them last.
Some help may be at hand as the Hong Kong government is expected to lay out new relief measures for low-income people and small businesses in its annual budget on Wednesday.
Leung Hon-Kee, a hotel cleaner who has lived in a ""coffin home"" for nearly a decade, is working fewer hours as tourism has all but dried up. He too is mostly constrained to his 3-square-metre bunk, and spends time surfing the internet on his phone.
""It doesn't feel good, but there's nothing we can do,"" he said.
One of Wong's main worries is the close proximity of his neighbors, some of whom have recently returned from mainland China, epicenter of the coronavirus.
""If we knew they were seriously ill, we'd kick them out,"" he said."

PALERMO/ROME (Reuters) - Italian authorities on Tuesday reported a woman had tested positive for coronavirus in Sicily, the first case south of Rome, as the country battles to prevent the outbreak spreading from its origin in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto.
Sicily's regional governor Nello Musumeci said a tourist from Bergamo, in Lombardy, had been hospitalized in the island's capital Palermo after being diagnosed with the illness and all those traveling with her had been quarantined.
The number of cases in Italy, the country in Europe worst affected, rose to more than 260 overnight from 229 on Monday, with 34 new cases reported in Lombardy and six new ones in Veneto. The number of deaths was unchanged at seven.
The health emergency had yielded a fragile political truce between Italy's warring parties which collapsed late on Monday after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte suggested malpractice at a hospital in Lombardy may have fueled the outbreak.
Conte said the hospital, which he did not name, had not followed the correct protocol ""and this contributed to the spread"", adding that he may consider withdrawing some of the powers of the regions over health policy.
The right-wing, opposition League party, which runs both Lombardy and Veneto, reacted furiously.
Its lower-house speaker Riccardo Molinari said Conte's words were ""almost fascist"" while the League's economics spokesman Claudio Borghi called the premier ""a disgrace to the country"".
Lombardy's Governor Attilio Fontana accused Conte of a ""desperation strategy ...probably trying to attack others to distract attention (from himself).""
Officials from the World Health Organization and the European Union were due to meet in Rome on Tuesday to discuss the crisis, which first broke out in China and has now spread to about 29 other countries and territories.
BUDGET LEEWAY
As economists warned that the outbreak in Italy would probably tip its already stagnant economy into recession, a senior official said the government may need to call on the European Union to offer leeway on its budget targets.
""There are resources the EU can give us in relation to economic events that could lower GDP considerably,"" Deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli said in a radio interview with state channel RAI.
Italy has proportionally the highest public debt in the euro zone after Greece's and has long struggled to respect the bloc's strict borrowing rules. Conte warned on Monday that the fallout from the outbreak could be ""very strong"".
Lombardy, the northern region that includes the financial capital Milan, and Veneto together account for about a third of Italy's gross domestic product and half of its exports.
Even before the outbreak of the virus, which triggered a fall of more than 5% on the Milan bourse on Monday, Italy was teetering on the edge of recession, after gross domestic product (GDP) fell 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
The tourist industry, which accounts for about 13% of GDP, fears a plunge in bookings as the government has ordered a clampdown on public events including soccer matches, cinemas and theaters.
A planned three-week shoot in Italy for Tom Cruise's new film ""Mission: Impossible"" was also postponed.
Milan cathedral was closed to visitors, the Venice carnival, one of the world's premier tourist attractions, was shut early for the first time in decades and airlines began restricting flights to Italy.
UK authorities on Tuesday advised British people who had visited northern Italy to self-isolate if they had any flu-like symptoms.
The outbreak of the disease over the weekend triggered alarm in Milan, bringing a drop in the number of people in public places and prompting shoppers to stock up on basics.
Esselunga, one of the biggest supermarket chains in northern Italy, said it was capable of keeping branches fully stocked and that shoppers had no need to buy any more than normal.

Incidents were reported on Lesbos and Chios, outlying Greek islands on the front line of a migratory flow of refugees and asylum seekers. 
Witnesses said about 500 people attempted to block the unloading of heavy machinery overnight to break ground at a construction site on Lesbos. 
Clashes on the streets followed, with residents attempting to block access to the construction site. Police used teargas in clashes with locals close to the area, where scores of people wore surgical masks, including a priest. Similar tensions were reported on Chios.
Greece's conservative government has taken a markedly tougher stance toward migration compared to the previous leftist government, issuing a tender for the construction of a floating fence to deter asylum seekers arriving by sea and introducing faster processing procedures that could increase deportations.
The site on Lesbos will be a closed camp that tightly controls access and will replace a current open-access camp at Moria, a sprawling facility built for less than 3,000 people which is now accommodating more than 18,000 asylum seekers.
""The government is making an effort to change something, to implement a plan,"" a government official said. ""If we don't construct new facilities, living conditions won't improve.""
Greek authorities plan to construct closed detention facilities on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Kos and Leros islands. The islands are close to Turkey, from where thousands of asylum seekers head to Europe each year.
Hundreds of thousands of people crossed into Europe from Turkey via Greece in 2015 and 2016 before a deal brokered by the European Union limited the flow. 

There has, however, been a resurgence in arrivals since September 2019.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan struggles to stem the spread of a coronavirus within its borders, critics are asking, ""Where's Abe?""
Shinzo Abe, 65, Japan's longest serving prime minister, has failed to take the helm as the public face of the response to the virus, critics say, leaving the task largely to his health minister.
Now doubts about Abe's leadership threaten to erode already sagging public support, with a newspaper survey at the weekend showing disapproval for his administration outweighing approval for the first time since July 2018. 
That, in turn, could upset rosy scenarios where Abe presides over a successful Tokyo Olympics set to start in July, leads his party to an election victory and perhaps even wins a rare fourth term at the Sept. 2021 end of his tenure as ruling party leader.
""Where is the leadership?"" asked Gerry Curtis, an expert in Japanese politics.
""Even now, he's not out there, not talking to the public and mobilising people,"" added Curtis, an emeritus professor at Columbia University. ""I think this will hurt him the longer it goes on.""
Abe has weathered several rough spots since he returned to office in December 2012.
But his support, already dented by recent scandals, including a row over too many supporters invited to a pricey party to view cherry blossoms, fell 8.4 points to 36.2% in the conservative Sankei newspaper's survey published at the weekend.
His non-approval rate rose 7.8 points to 46.7%.
Voters were split over the government's response to the virus, with 85 percent saying they worried about the disease.
""Although the people's anxiety is growing daily, he (Abe) hasn't held a proper news conference,"" said a Twitter user with the handle @yumidesu.
""In other words, if he appears more often, only a bad image will remain, so, to avoid that, he is appearing in public as little as possible.""
CRITICAL STAGE
Japan has drawn heavy criticism for its handling of a virus outbreak on the U.K.-registered cruise ship Diamond Princess that caused 691 infections, killing four passengers, since the vessel docked near Tokyo on Feb. 3.
Concern has also grown as the tally of domestically-transmitted cases has swelled past 159, including one death.
The government unveiled measures on Tuesday to slow the pace of infections and deaths.
""We are at an extremely critical stage to bring about an early end to the spread of the virus,"" said Abe, reading quickly from a document at a meeting on the measures, before leaving Health Minister Katsunobu Kato to explain them to reporters.
The steps include precautions such as working online from home, commuting to jobs at staggered times and asking organizers of events to weigh up plans carefully.
Some other countries are taking stiffer steps.
Italy, which emerged on Monday as a new frontier in the fight on the virus, has sealed off its worst affected towns, closed schools and halted the carnival in Venice.
U.S. President Donald Trump has asked Congress for $2.5 billion to fight the virus, although House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decried those funds as being insufficient.
That compares to Japan's figure of 10.3 billion yen ($92 million) allocated from budget reserves, although Jiji news agency reported further funding was being considered.
""I think he (Abe) is in denial,"" said Koiichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University.
""They are trying to believe the most optimistic scenarios, even if they don't really.""
ECONOMY CHILL?
Social media critics questioned why Abe did not close Japan's borders to all Chinese visitors instead of just those from the central province of Hubei, whose capital Wuhan is the epicenter of the epidemic, and the eastern province of Zhejiang.
Abe has overseen a warming of ties with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, despite criticism from within his Liberal Democratic Party, and officials publicly say preparations are on track for an April visit by Xi.
Japan's economy has also grown heavily reliant on Chinese tourists in recent years.
Some skeptics also suggested Japan was holding down the numbers of those tested to minimize the number of infections.
Maybe the Japanese government wants to hold the Tokyo Olympics so they try to hide the number of infected people. Shinzo Abe is good at hiding,"" said a Twitter user going by the handle @shumi_wake.
Abe has made hosting the Olympics, which run until Aug. 9, a key goal of his administration. On Tuesday, Health Minister Kato said it was too early to talk about cancelling them.
Experts said the next few weeks will be crucial to show if Japan can stem the pace of virus spread. If not, patient numbers could surge to overwhelm the health system and hit the economy.
Japan's economy shrank in the December quarter at its fastest pace in almost six years, hit by a rise in sales tax. That raises the risk of a recession as the virus chills activity.

""If the economy tanks and never gets a boost from the Olympics, it's going to be catastrophic,"" said Nakano.

The United States was working productively with Pakistan to counter terrorism on its soil, Trump said at a joint press conference with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in capital New Delhi.
New Delhi and Washington are yet to sign a trade deal, but the two countries would begin talks to strike a comprehensive agreement, Trump and Modi said.
Trump also said he discussed with Modi, whom he calls his ""dear friend"", the importance of a secure 5G telecoms network in India, ahead of a planned airwaves auction by the country.
The United States has banned Huawei, arguing the use of its kit creates the potential for espionage by China - a claim denied by Huawei and Beijing - but India, where telecoms companies have long used network gear from the Chinese firm, is yet to make a call.

Islamic Jihad had fired 80 rockets towards Israeli communities along the Gaza border since Sunday, an Israeli military spokeswoman said, while Israel attacked sites in Gaza and Syria that killed three members of the militant group.
No casualties were reported on the Israeli side of the frontier and many of the rockets were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome missile system.
The violence came a week before an Israeli election in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking a fifth term in office after two inconclusive votes.
The frontier fell quiet early on Tuesday, after a Palestinian official said Israel and Islamic Jihad had reached a ""reciprocal and simultaneous ceasefire"" mediated by Egypt and the United Nations.
""This round is over and Palestinian resistance promised its people that every act of aggression by the Zionist occupation would be met by a reaction from the resistance,"" Khader Habib, a senior Islamic Jihad official, told Reuters.
The Israeli military said it reopened roads near the Gaza border on Tuesday that it had closed when the fighting began and that train services would resume in the area.
But citing security concerns, the military kept Israel's border crossings with Gaza closed, except for humanitarian cases, and banned Palestinian fisherman from heading to sea.
The violence erupted on Sunday when Israeli troops killed an Islamic Jihad member who the military said was trying to plant explosives near Israel's border fence with the Gaza Strip.
Video widely shared on social media showed what appeared to be a lifeless body of the militant dangling from an Israeli military bulldozer as it removed the corpse.
The images created an uproar in Gaza, prompting calls for retaliation that were followed by rockets launched by Islamic Jihad."

The CDU succession debate was blown wide open earlier this month when party leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer unexpectedly said she would no longer seek to succeed her mentor Merkel. 
Spahn had been expected to run for the position. 
He is due to hold a news conference with Armin Laschet - the premier of North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, who is expected to announce his candidacy - at 0830 GMT. Laschet is widely seen as the continuity candidate.
German magazine Focus reported that Spahn would run as Laschet's deputy.
Merkel, chancellor of Europe's biggest economy for almost 15 years, has said she will not run again in the next federal election, due by Oct. 2021. It is unclear if she will be able to remain chancellor until then with a new party leader.
Kramp-Karrenbauer has stressed that the party's top brass expected the winner of the leadership contest to work alongside Merkel.
Friedrich Merz, on the right of the party and a long-time archrival of Merkel, is also expected to stand at a news conference later on Tuesday morning.
Last week, Norbert Roettgen, head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, unexpectedly joined the leadership race.
The new CDU leader is in a strong position to be the conservative bloc's candidate for chancellor in the next election, although Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU) also have a big say. They may prefer to put forward their own leader, Markus Soeder.
The CDU plans to pick a new leader at a special congress on April 25, an attempt to resolve a crisis that is shaking the party's hold on power.

The conservative bloc currently rules in coalition with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD).

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala's former attorney general and recent presidential candidate Thelma Aldana said on Monday the United States has granted her asylum, days after her successor filed an extradition request for alleged irregularities during her tenure.
""It is great news for me but must also be for the brave prosecutors who in Guatemala and other countries fight for justice in the world,"" Aldana told Reuters. ""It gives me a lot of peace but also nostalgia.""
The former anti-corruption crusader, who is already in the United States, is facing two processes in Guatemala for irregularities she allegedly committed during her tenure from 2014 to 2018.
Aldana had helped uncover corruption in cases that led to the conviction and imprisonment of former President Otto Perez. She supported the U.N.-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, which departed the country last year after the government did not renew its mandate.
Eliot Engel, chair of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, announced the decision to grant asylum on Twitter. ""Thelma is a champion for justice and this is a major victory for the international fight against corruption,"" he wrote.
Last year, Aldana was barred from running for president because of an arrest warrant against her in a corruption case that supporters said was trumped up.

Gui, a bookseller previously based in Hong Kong who sold books critical of China's political leadership, was detained by mainland police in 2018. He was seized by plainclothes police while with Swedish diplomats.
Gui's situation soured relations between Sweden and China in the months leading up to Monday's sentencing, with Chinese officials warning Swedish counterparts of meddling in Chinese internal affairs.
Swedish foreign ministry officials, who had demanded his release, have yet to comment.
The Ningbo court statement said Gui, 55, had stated that he would not appeal the sentence and had asked to have his Chinese citizenship reinstated.
Chinese officials objected to Svenska PEN, a literary organization, awarding Gui Minhai the 2019 Tulcholsky Prize, praising his service to free speech.
Swedish culture minister Amanda Lind defied Chinese diplomatic threats of ""countermeasures"" to present the prize.
Gui is the highest-profile of five booksellers who disappeared between October and December 2015, all linked to a Hong Kong bookshop famous for its gossipy texts on Chinese political leaders.
Such books are banned on the mainland but their production and sale is legal within Hong Kong under the extensive freedoms guaranteed as part of the 1997 handover of the city from British colonial rule to Chinese sovereignty.
Gui was initially abducted in the Thai beach resort of Pattaya before surfacing, like the others, in detention in mainland China. 
Three of his colleagues were detained in mainland China while another was widely thought to have been abducted in Hong Kong and spirited across the border. Gui is the only one to have remained in detention. 
His daughter Angela, along with other supporters, has repeatedly called for his release, saying he is a victim of illegal political persecution.

Former Conservative Senator Aida Merlano was captured by Venezuelan police last month after she escaped custody in Bogota last year by climbing out of her dentist's office while on a medical leave from prison and fleeing on the back of a motorcycle.
At a recent court appearance in Caracas, Merlano, who was convicted of vote-buying, accused Duque of wanting to kill her to protect the country's political class. In a recent interview, she also alleged he benefited from vote-buying.
Duque's government has said the accusations are a fabrication and that Merlano is being used by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to put on a ""media show.""
The investigation comes after leftist Representative David Racero requested an inquiry into Merlano's accusations.
""In my capacity as the president of the investigations committee, after reading the complaint by Representative David Racero against the president of the republic, we have taken the decision to open an investigation,"" John Jairo Cardenas, of the centrist Partido de la Unidad, told local radio.
Colombia does not recognize Maduro's government and has requested Merlano's extradition through Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, whom it considers to be Venezuela's legitimate head of state.
It is not clear how Guaido will handle the request given that Maduro retains control of most government functions including the police and judiciary.
The Colombian house committee regularly investigates Colombian presidents. Ernesto Samper, who governed from 1994 to 1998, was the subject of inquiries surrounding accusations he financed his campaign with drug trafficking money. He was exonerated."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration rolled out a new immigration policy on Monday that bars people deemed likely to require government benefits such as housing and food assistance from obtaining permanent residency in the United States.
Local and state officials overseeing public health and social services in New York said that some immigrants were disenrolling from certain food assistance programs and Medicare even if they might not be affected by the rule, which places new limits on eligibility for green cards.
The city said it would be ramping up programs - like a hotline for immigrants and access to legal services - in an effort to counter misinformation about the rule's implementation.
""Why is the rule harmful? Because it is sowing confusion; it is creating fear,"" said Steven Banks, the commissioner of New York City's Department of Social Services. 
U.S. immigration law has long required officials to deny green cards to people likely to become a ""public charge,"" but the term had been narrowly defined as being dependent on cash assistance or institutionalized at the government's expense. 
The new rule broadens the definition to include anyone who would receive a much wider range of benefits and takes into account factors such as age, educational level and English proficiency.
Ken Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), said in a Fox News interview on Monday that the new regulation would help ensure immigrants do not burden U.S. taxpayers and ""will be able to stand on their own two feet.""
U.S. President Donald Trump has made cracking down on immigration a key platform of his presidency and has moved to restrict some forms of legal immigration while also trying to cut down on illegal border crossings. 
The new eligibility tests will be considered primarily for those in the United States on visas seeking to change their status, as well as those applying at U.S. consulates abroad for green cards. 
Most immigrants seeking green cards are not eligible for public benefits. But advocates worry they will unnecessarily forgo programs they and their U.S. citizen children are entitled to such as the supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children known as WIC, which is not covered by the regulation. 

Rejecting challenges, the U.S. Supreme Court let the rule go forward nationwide.

Northam vowed to push through new gun control laws and backed a package of eight bills, including universal background checks, a ""red flag"" law, restrictions on gun ownership for those convicted of domestic abuse and a limit of handgun sales to one per month for an individual.
Legislators last week knocked down one of the measures Northam pushed, a ban on assault-style rifles, which several lawmakers from his own party did not support.
The Virginia House of Delegates already passed the measures earlier this month. The full state Senate is expected to vote on the measures this week, while a joint committee will meet to iron out the final language in the bill if the wording is changed slightly between houses.
Virginia, where Democrats took control of the legislature last year by promising stronger gun laws, has become the latest focal point for the contentious American debate around the right to bear arms. Many gun-rights groups contend the U.S. Constitution guarantees their ability to possess any firearm. Those opposed say gun laws would help lessen the number of people killed by guns each year.
On Jan. 20, gun advocates held a massive rally around the state capital building, with some 22,000 gun-toting protesters demonstrating peaceably and calling on state lawmakers to protect their right to bear arms.
This isn't Northam's first attempt to push through gun laws. He called a special legislative session last year after the massacre of 12 people in Virginia Beach, but the Republicans who then controlled the legislature ended that meeting without a vote."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States wants Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to defer his second-term inauguration over concerns it could inflame an election feud with his political rival and jeopardize U.S.-led peacemaking efforts, two sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Ghani claimed victory last week in a disputed Sept. 28 election and plans to take the oath of office on Thursday, an Afghan official said. His opponent, Abdullah Abdullah, Ghani's former deputy, also proclaimed himself the winner and is planning a parallel inauguration, according to Afghan media reports.
The competing claims, neither of which Washington has recognized, threaten a U.S.-led peace process that got a boost on Saturday with the start of a week-long reduction in violence that is to culminate on Saturday with the signing of a U.S.-Taliban deal on a U.S. troop withdrawal.
The U.S.-Taliban agreement is to be followed by inter-Afghan talks on a political settlement to end decades of war. 
But the Ghani-Abdullah feud threatens to further complicate the naming of a delegation to negotiate with the insurgents, a process already mired in delays and disputes. 
A source familiar with the matter said that because of those concerns, U.S. Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been in Kabul since last week, wants Ghani to delay his planned inauguration to a second five-year term.
The U.S. State Department and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Afghan Embassy in Washington declined comment. 
President Donald Trump has made the withdrawal of the roughly 13,000 U.S. service members from Afghanistan a major foreign policy objective. An agreement with the Taliban to end America's longest war could boost Trump's re-election prospects.
A former senior Afghan official said Khalilzad, an Afghan-born veteran U.S. diplomat, was pressing Ghani to postpone the ceremony and trying to persuade Abdullah to do the same to preserve the peace process.
The sources requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
VOTE-RIGGING ALLEGATIONS
The former senior Afghan official said that even if there was an ""inclusive"" delegation chosen to talk with the Taliban, the Ghani-Abdullah feud could ""spill into the negotiating process.""
U.S. allies also appeared to share U.S. concerns that the dispute could hamper the peace process, with NATO's civilian representative to Kabul calling on Monday for ""calm, dialogue and compromise by all political leaders.""
Writing on Twitter, Nicholas Kay urged ""all parties to prioritize the peace process and national unity. NATO does not support actions by any party that increase tensions or the risk of violence.""
There are about 4,000 non-U.S. NATO troops in Afghanistan.
China, which has a border with Afghanistan, said it welcomed a ""possible"" U.S. Taliban deal.
The official Xinhua news agency quoted Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian as saying that foreign forces should be withdrawn in a way that avoids ""a security vacuum, which terrorist organizations may take advantage of.""
The Sept. 28 presidential election vote-counting process was beset by allegations of rigging, technical problems with biometric devices used for voting and other irregularities.
The Independent Election Commission said on Feb. 18 that Ghani had won 50.64 percent of the vote, while Abdullah was named the runner-up with 39.52 percent.
Abdullah rejected the results, and said he would name his own Cabinet. Last weekend, he named loyalists as governors to two provinces.
U.S. forces invaded Afghanistan in 2001 to topple the Taliban rulers who provided the sanctuary in which the al Qaeda militant group planned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington that killed almost 3,000 people.
The U.S. troops stationed in Afghanistan are part of a U.S-led NATO mission that is training and assisting Afghan forces and carrying out counterterrorism operations to prop up the Kabul government and prevent an al Qaeda resurgence.

Ottawa made the announcement after a court in the province of Quebec last September said part of the law on physician-assisted suicide was too limited and should therefore be considered unconstitutional.
The proposed changes would ""remove the requirement for a person's natural death to be reasonably foreseeable in order to be eligible for medical assistance in dying,"" Justice Minister David Lametti said in a statement.
Canada is one of the few nations where doctors can legally help sick people die. There have been more than 13,000 reported medically assisted deaths in Canada.
When Parliament adopted the law in June 2016, the government had said it might broaden the criteria for accessibility.
The Quebec court ruled in favor of two people who were both in severe pain and had incurable medical conditions. The two argued the law was too restrictive given it limited access to those facing foreseeable death.
Lametti said the government would launch a review of medically assisted death later this year to consider applications from people who currently do not qualify.
These include advance requests for those newly diagnosed with a condition that could affect their decision-making capacity in the future, people suffering solely from mental illness as well those under 19 who doctors deemed capable of giving their consent.
The Liberals only have a minority of seats in the House of Commons and will need to rely on the support of opposition legislators to approve the legislation, a process that could take many months."

LIMA (Reuters) - Latin American countries who are hosting the most Venezuelan migrants could in future receive financial support from an international fund, Peru's foreign minister said on Monday.
Gustavo Mesa-Cuadra said authorities from different nations and organizations would meet in the coming months to discuss the formation of a donors' group to help those affected by the second largest migrant flow in the world after those fleeing the civil war in Syria.
The meeting was being arranged by the Lima Group of 15 countries to seek resolutions to the Venezuela crisis in concert with international organizations including the World Bank, and would be held in Washington or Spain, the minister said.
The United Nations has estimated that four million Venezuelan migrants are abroad because of the country's economic and political crisis and $1.35 billion will be needed this year alone to meet their basic needs in the 17 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that are sheltering them.
Some 5,000 Venezuelans leave their country each day, the Organization of American States has said, and the number could double to 8 million by the end of 2020.
""A meeting (for) a donor drive to fulfill the needs of host countries is one of the things we are working on very seriously,"" Mesa-Cuadra told reporters in Lima.
He did not provide further details about the countries or agencies that could make up the donor grouping or the amounts they would raise.
Some 860,000 Venezuelans have arrived in Peru fleeing the crisis in Venezuela, according to data from the migration office until 2018, making the Andean country the second largest recipient of these migrants after Colombia.
Meza-Cuadra reaffirmed that the main objective of the Lima Group remains ""the return to democracy in Venezuela"" while supporting the opposition leader Juan Guaidó, recognized by more than 50 countries as the legitimate leader instead of socialist President Nicolas Maduro."

VOLKMARSEN, Germany (Reuters) - A German man plowed his car into a carnival parade in the western town of Volkmarsen on Monday, injuring 30 people including children, police said, adding it was too early to say what his motive was.
German prosecutors and police said the suspect, a 29-year-old German citizen, had been arrested on suspicion of attempted homicide. The motive remained unclear and investigators were looking into all possibilities, they added.
""This is a terrible day, this is a terrible deed,"" said Peter Beuth, interior minister of Hesse, the western German state where Volkmarsen is located.
A third of those injured were children, he said, and police still had no indication of the possible motive.
""It can be assumed that it was intentional,"" police spokesman Henning Hinn said at the scene, where debris from the carnival littered the ground and a silver Mercedes-Benz car that appeared to have been involved was taped off by police.
He said eight to 10 of around 30 people injured were seriously hurt. ""Among those who are seriously injured are children, unfortunately,"" he added. Bild newspaper said some of the injuries were life-threatening.
German news website HNA cited witnesses saying the man appeared to have targeted children and had driven ""at full throttle"" into the crowd, which had gathered for a traditional procession ahead of the Christian season of Lent.
""People were coming towards me, crying,"" Bild newspaper quoted local county commissioner Reinhard Kubat as saying.
""There were mainly injured children in the street, but also older people. Children came up to me and said it sounded like 'Plop, plop, plop' whenever the car ran over a person.""
Police called off all carnival parades in Hesse as a precautionary measure, but said they were not aware of any danger elsewhere in Germany.
NO ONGOING THREAT
""We have no specific indications of an ongoing threat,"" police said.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her thoughts were with the injured and their relatives and thanked police and medics.
The incident comes less than a week after a man shot dead nine people before killing his mother and himself, in one of the worst racist attacks in Germany since World War Two.
Carnivals are hugely popular in parts of western Germany, especially in Rhineland cities such as Cologne and Duesseldorf, where festivities peak on ""Rose Monday"" with tens of thousands attending street parades featuring comical or satirical floats.
Police cars and ambulances rushed to the scene in Volkmarsen, a small town 260 miles (420 km) west of Berlin.
German media said the driver deliberately broke through plastic barriers set up by police around the parade area, where 1,500 people were expected to gather.
The car continued driving through the crowd for about 30 meters (33 yards) before coming to a halt, a witness told local broadcaster Hessenschau.
Spokesmen for the police and state prosecutors declined to comment on local media reports that police had arrested a second person in connection with the incident.

In 2016, a Tunisian man with Islamist militant ties plowed a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people. He was later shot dead by Italian police after he fled Germany.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday appeared open to reinstating $4.3 billion in punitive damages against Sudan in lawsuits accusing it of complicity in the 1998 al Qaeda bombings of two U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people.
Eight justices heard about an hour of arguments in an appeal - filed by people injured and relatives of people killed in the attacks - of a 2017 lower court ruling that blocked the plaintiffs from collecting the punitive damages imposed against Sudan alongside about $6 billion in compensatory damages. Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not participate in the case. 
The justices directed the bulk of their questioning toward an attorney representing Sudan as opposed to the plaintiffs. Conservative and liberal justices raised doubts over Sudan's argument that it could not be hit with punitive damages. 
Sudan, riven by civil war and unrest, has been trying to reduce its exposure in the litigation.
Twelve Americans were among the dead in the Aug. 7, 1998, attacks, with thousands of other people wounded. The lawsuits involve 567 people, most of whom are non-U.S. citizens who were employees of the U.S. government and their relatives. 
Doreen Oport, 58, who was working as an immigration assistant in the embassy in Kenya's capital Nairobi during the attack and suffered burns and other injuries, expressed optimism following the arguments.
""We are waiting for justice,"" Oport said. 
President Donald Trump's administration urged the justices to side with the plaintiffs. 
The damages were imposed by default because for most of the litigation Sudan did not appear before a lower court to counter accusations that it harbored and provided support to the Islamist militant group al Qaeda, which led to the bombings. Sudan denies the allegations. 
The truck bombs that detonated outside the embassies in Nairobi as well as Dar es Salaam, Tanzania marked the first large-scale al Qaeda attack. Three years later, on Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda operatives carried out attacks in the United States, killing nearly 3,000 people.
Starting in 2001, several groups of plaintiffs sued in federal court in Washington under the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which generally bars claims against foreign countries except those designated by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism, as Sudan has been since 1993. Other claims were made under local District of Columbia law. 
A federal judge found Sudan liable and awarded the plaintiffs $10.2 billion, including $4.3 in punitive damages. 
In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld Sudan's liability, but ruled that a 2008 change in the law allowing for punitive damages was enacted after the bombings occurred and cannot be applied retroactively.
During Monday's arguments, some justices seemed skeptical that the 2008 change precluded such damages.

""If we agree that compensatory damages apply retroactively, on what account does it make sense to speak of punitive damages not also applying retroactively, given that it's authorized by the same statute?"" conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch asked.

The Pegasus plane flying into Istanbul from the western coastal province of Izmir slipped off the end of the wet runway and broke into three pieces after what officials said was a drop of 30 to 40 meters (98 to 131 ft).
The two pilots of the plane, a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-86J, were each questioned following the crash, and Anadolu said on Monday that one of them, captain Mahmut Arslan, had been arrested. It did not give further details."

ATMEH, Syria (Reuters) - Syrian government forces are advancing closer to the displaced persons camp where Adnan Abdelkarim and his family have taken shelter along the Turkish border after being uprooted multiple times, and he fears there is nowhere left to go. 
""Today the regime is advancing from everywhere and we are trapped along the border,"" said 30-year-old Abdelkarim. 
At the Atmeh camp on the northern edge of Idlib province, uprooted families are arriving in droves as they flee bombardment from air strikes and artillery shelling.
They fear being trapped between the fighting and the closed-off Turkish border. About 50 meters from the camp an imposing gray concrete wall is crowned with barbed wire, blocking their entry to Turkey.
""In the event the regime advances..., either we will die storming the Turkish wall and fleeing with our families...or slaughter ourselves by turning ourselves over,"" said Abdelkarim.
Backed by heavy Russian air power, Syrian government forces have stepped up a campaign to retake the last rebel stronghold in the northwestern regions of Aleppo and Idlib, sparking an exodus of nearly a million people toward a shrinking pocket along the Turkish frontier. 
On Monday, Russian and Syrian warplanes continued to pound eastern and southern areas of Idlib province, according to the Syrian Observatory, a war monitor, and witnesses. 
The Observatory said on Monday that pro-Damascus forces had seized control of 10 more towns in southern areas of Idlib province in less than 24 hours. It said fighting continued meanwhile around the Idlib town of Neirab between government forces and rebels backed by Turkish artillery.
""People here have little hope and everyone has started to head toward the border, fearful of the (government) advance,"" said Ismail Shahine, 37, originally displaced six years earlier from the Hama countryside. 
Shahine on Monday prepared a tent to accommodate the rest of his family, which he said would soon arrive from the western countryside of Aleppo, where government forces have retaken large swathes of land from rebels at a rapid clip in recent weeks.
Fearing a fresh refugee crisis, Turkey has poured thousands of troops into Idlib in the last few weeks and President Tayyip Erdogan has threatened to use military force to drive back Syrian forces unless they pull back by the end of the month.
Turkey hosts about 3.7 million Syrians and says it cannot absorb any more.
As Turkish military convoys continue to enter northern Syria, Shahine and others near the border have pinned their hopes on Erdogan's pledge to force Damascus to retreat.

""Everyone today is waiting for the start of the coming month, for the deadline that Erdogan gave the regime to withdraw,"" said Shahine. ""I am expecting that they will make a move and not leave the Syrian people to fend for themselves.""

A first case was confirmed in France last week of a virus that can ravage tomato plants, which the ANSES agency said was one of a growing list of emerging diseases that risked taking hold in the country.
""When there are sanitary crises in plants, you don't have antibiotics. The main response is eradication: you destroy and you disinfect,"" ANSES director general Roger Genet told reporters on Monday at the annual Paris farm show.
""We need to keep a range of effective molecules and at the same time reduce their use as much as possible,"" he said.
France's blanket ban on neonicotinoids, a type of insecticide blamed for endangering honeybees, had for example removed an effective product to combat the red palm weevil, Genet added.
The beetle, which attacks palm trees, is present on France's Mediterranean coast.
As the agency that delivers permits for crop pesticides, ANSES has been at the centre of fierce debate over pesticide use, including a government plan to phase out common weedkiller glyphosate.
ANSES said in December that it was withdrawing licences for dozens of weedkillers due to insufficient data on safety risks or where there were alternatives, as it continued a government-requested review of glyphosate-based products.
The French government is pushing to phase out glyphosate by next year. The herbicide has been linked to cancer, but many farmers and scientists say it is safe when used correctly.
However, the government has said it will allow exemptions where there are no other viable options, notably for soil conservation farming that avoids ploughing but uses glyphosate."

The announcement follows a meeting last month of representatives for the countries and the U.N. postal agency.
""The decision to resume international postal exchanges is welcome news,"" the U.N. Universal Postal Union said.
Along with the United Arab Emirates, the three countries have since June 2017 cut most political, trade and transport ties with Qatar over charges it supports terrorism. Doha denies that, saying the boycott aims to curtail its sovereignty.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain were to resume services indirectly, with mail transported through Oman, just like the UAE, which restored postal services with Qatar on Feb. 9.
There are no direct flights between Qatar and the four Arab states.
Egypt resumed services on Feb. 17, according to state-run Egypt Post. It was not immediately clear if Saudi Arabia and Bahrain had yet restored services.
Saudi, Egyptian and Bahraini authorities could not be immediately reached for comment.
The restoration came after the U.N. agency held a meeting with postal representatives from Qatar and the four Arab states at its headquarters in Switzerland on Jan. 29.
However, it was not immediately clear why the service had been restored amid the wider, protracted row.
Qatar's Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said on Feb. 15 talks with Saudi Arabia to end the dispute had been suspended, confirming an earlier Reuters report."

KIEV (Reuters) - When Ukraine Health Minister Zoriana Skaletska felt her messages about the coronavirus epidemic were not cutting through, she decided to join nearly 100 people in a quarantine facility to stop panic from spreading among the general public.
Ukraine has not recorded a single coronavirus case but the arrival last week of a planeload of evacuees from China, none of whom are believed to be infected, sparked violent protests outside the sanatorium where they were housed.
Skaletska moved into the facility for the duration of their two-week quarantine. On Monday, wearing a mask and protective suit, she met the inmates, posting pictures on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) with the hashtag #IamnotafraidofthevirusIamwithyou.
Her decision has attracted both praise and criticism from people who called it a publicity stunt. While she did not expect them, Skaletska told Reuters the brickbats did not bother her.
""If I let all this get into my head, I would not have been able to stand working in the ministry from the first week. There are bots, there are people who do not understand, they need somewhere to post their indignation,"" she said.
Last Thursday people in the town of Novi Sanzhary, where the sanatorium is located, clashed with police and hurled projectiles at a convoy of buses carrying the arrivals from China.
Despite reassurances from the authorities, the protesters worried they could be infected and wanted the evacuees moved away.
While speaking to Reuters via Skype from the sanatorium, Skaletska got a call from President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday evening.
""Everything is OK, I am not crying anymore,"" she told Zelenskiy, after stress and lack of sleep in the aftermath of the protests had brought her to tears.
Moving to the sanatorium meant Skaletska missing her daughter's 10th birthday on Friday.
""I called her in the evening, I said, 'Yaryna, I'm sorry, the state needed help, don't be jealous,'"" Skaletska said. ""She replied, 'I am jealous and, actually, the state will owe me.'"""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A policeman was killed and dozens of people injured amid clashes in New Delhi on Monday as thousands demonstrating for and against a new citizenship law rioted for several hours before U.S. President Donald Trump's maiden visit to the city.
Police used tear gas and smoke grenades but struggled to disperse the crowds, as both sides hurled stones and turned a wide boulevard into a rock-strewn battle zone, about 11 miles from where Trump will meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks on Tuesday.
One police constable was killed, a police official told Reuters, declining to be named since he isn't authorized to speak to media.
An official at Delhi's GTB Hospital said more than 35 people injured in the clashes were undergoing treatment. Reuters partner ANI reported that one civilian had also died, but Reuters was unable to confirm it.
Reuters reporters saw multiple vehicles set on fire, metal barricades torn down and thick smoke billowing as supporters of the new law clashed with opponents. A small contingent of police was vastly outnumbered.
India's capital has been a hotbed of protests against the law, which eases the path of non-Muslims from three neighboring Muslim-dominated countries to gain Indian citizenship.
This has led to accusations that Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are undermining India's secular traditions.
The BJP denies any bias against India's more than 180 million-strong Muslim minority, but objectors have been holding protests and camping out in parts of New Delhi for two months.
Monday's clashes were among the worst seen in New Delhi since the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) began in early December.
The latest round of violence came as Trump began his first visit to India as U.S. president, addressing a rally in Modi's home state of Gujarat.
Trump landed in New Delhi late on Monday.
'GO AHEAD AND THROW STONES'
The clashes stretched over a nearly kilometer long road and lasted from early afternoon until well into the evening, leaving at least half a dozen people injured.
Police on Monday imposed an emergency law prohibiting any gatherings in the violence-hit areas.
The protesters appeared to be divided along religious lines, and some repeatedly hailed Hindu god Ram while pelting stones at the predominantly Muslim group opposed to the new law.
A Reuters witness saw at least one Muslim man and a burqa-clad woman beaten by dozens of pro-law protesters with sticks and iron rods.
Earlier on Monday, local politician Yogendra Yadav described the violence as ""communal"" and urged police to intervene.
But for several hours, Reuters witnesses saw the outnumbered policemen mostly stand beside those backing the citizenship law, a majority Hindu group, and do little to quell the violence. The police also stood by as a mob vandalized a store with a Muslim name, pulling out vehicles and setting them alight.
""Go ahead and throw stones,"" one policeman shouted to protesters backing the law, during one of the running battles.
On side streets, young boys drained fuel from motorcycles to make petrol bombs, and protesters pulled up paving stones and flung construction material at opponents.
""We are in support of the CAA. If they want to protest, they should go somewhere else,"" said a protester who gave his name as Amit.
India's junior home minister G. Kishan Reddy said the violence was a ""conspiracy to shame India globally"" during Trump's visit.
""We have deployed additional forces, and we will do everything to bring law and order under control,"" he told Reuters partner ANI.
In Gujarat, Trump told a gathering of more than 100,000 people that ""India is a country that proudly embraces freedom, liberty, individual rights, the rule of law, and the dignity of every human being""."

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations is in talks with Turkey to boost cross-border aid flows into northwest Syria and allow more evacuations of those in urgent need of medical help, such as babies in incubators, as shelling draws closer.
More than three million people are trapped in northwest Syria between the Turkish border and advancing Syrian government forces, who are trying to seize back control of the last large rebel-held province of Idlib.
Mark Cutts, U.N. deputy regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, said fighting was now coming ""dangerously close to the area where more than a million are living in tents and makeshift shelters"".
""We have been talking with the Turkish authorities about ways of increasing the capacity of aid crossing at the border from Turkey into northwest Syria,"" Cutts told reporters.
About 50 trucks daily are crossing the bigger of two authorized Turkish border crossings, Bab al-Hawa, and the U.N. humanitarian agency OCHA wants to increase this to 100.
""So the aid is flowing, there is a big aid operation, but the reality is that it is simply not enough. We are barely able to meet the needs of people for the most urgent food rations and tents and blankets and winter items,"" he added.
Cutts shared with Reuters a message from a medical worker in the Sarmada children's hospital near the border asking advice on whether to evacuate about 80 babies and infants, including some in incubators and intensive care units.
""With shelling coming close to that area, many of the staff felt they needed to evacuate the hospital but... there was nowhere to evacuate those babies and those infants to,"" he said.
TREATMENT IN TURKEY
Turkey allows some ""humanitarian cases"" to be sent there for treatment and arrangements could be made for more, Cutts said.
OCHA says 77 medical facilities have been forced to suspend their activities in northwest Syria since Dec. 1. Some were hit by air strikes. Cutts confirmed that a warehouse had been looted last week and said another had been bombed recently.
In January, the U.N. Security Council allowed a cross-border aid operation to continue from Turkey but closed crossing points from Iraq and Jordan due to opposition from Russia and China..
Cutts said he was ""extremely concerned"" about the continuation of that cross-border aid after June.
Turkey is already hosting 3.7 million Syrian refugees. It says it cannot take more and was hoping to create a ""safe zone"" along the border to resettle them but the renewed spike in violence has endangered that plan.
The current wave of displacement is the worst in Syria's nine-year conflict, with nearly a million people uprooted since December. More than half of them are children."
476,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 11:09AM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court to hear religious fight over same-sex foster care,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a major religious rights dispute involving the city of Philadelphia's refusal to place children for foster care with a Catholic agency that bars same-sex couples from serving as foster parents.
The justices will take up an appeal by Catholic Social Services, an arm of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia that accused the city of violating the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and religion. A lower court ruled in 2018 that the religious views of the organization did not entitle it to an exemption from the city's anti-discrimination policies.
The case provides the court's 5-4 conservative majority another chance to recognize broader religious rights under the Constitution, as it has done in key cases in recent years. The case will be argued in the court's next term, which starts in October.
Catholic Social Services, which has helped provide foster care services for more than a century, has said it would be forced to close its foster care operations if it is unable to participate in Philadelphia's program. 
A ruling against Philadelphia could make it easier for people to cite religious beliefs when seeking exemptions from widely applicable laws.
As part of the case, Catholic Social Services asked the court to overturn a 1990 Supreme Court ruling, called Employment Division v. Smith, that limited the ability of people to seek such exemptions. Congress subsequently enacted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which allows people to bring religious claims against the federal government but not the states.
The ruling was written by the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who was a champion of religious rights. But religious rights advocates have said the ruling infringes on the constitutionally protected free exercise of religion.
Even if the court does not overturn the 1990 ruling, the challengers at a minimum want the justices to make it easier for religious entities to bring claims when they accuse the government of targeting them because of their religious beliefs.
Philadelphia in 2018 suspended foster care referrals to Catholic Social Services after a newspaper report about the agency's policy of turning away same-sex couples seeking to serve as foster parents. The agency had a contract with the city for placement of foster children. It said the city's action means that available foster homes are sitting empty amid a foster care crisis in the city of about 1.5 million people.
Three foster parents, Sharonell Fulton, Toni Simms-Busch and Cecelia Paul, joined the agency in the lawsuit. Paul has since died.
U.S. District Judge Petrese Tucker in Philadelphia in 2018 ruled against the agency. Last year, the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled against Catholic Social Services, saying it had not shown that Philadelphia had treated it differently because of its religious affiliation.
Ten of the 50 states currently allow private agencies to refuse to place children with same-sex couples, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a group that backs gay rights. Nine states bar discrimination based on sexual orientation in foster care.
In court papers, Philadelphia's lawyers said that Catholic Social Services has an interim contract that provides funds for children already in its foster homes. Catholic Social Services continues to contract with the city for other services.
MIXED MESSAGES
The Supreme Court in recent years has sent mixed messages on the conflict between gay and religious rights. It backed gay rights in a series of landmark rulings culminating in the 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. It also bolstered religious rights, including a 2014 ruling that allowed owners of businesses to raise religious objections against the government.
Central to those cases was conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired in July 2018 and was replaced by President Donald Trump's appointee Brett Kavanaugh. Kennedy wrote the gay marriage ruling, joining with the court's liberals, but joined with his fellow conservatives in the religious rights decision.
Kavanaugh, who may cast the decisive vote in the Philadelphia case, has shown sympathy to religious liberty claims. 
There has been a renewed interest among U.S. religious conservatives in seeking to overturn the 1990 ruling as part of the backlash to the legalization of gay marriage. Conservative opposition to gay marriage has figured in several legal disputes in which small business owners have refused to serve same-sex couples. 

In a major LGBT rights case, the Supreme Court in October heard arguments over whether a landmark federal law forbidding sex discrimination in the workplace protects gay and transgender employees. A ruling is due by the end of June.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - When the grip of Iraq's Tehran-backed Shi'ite Muslim parties and militias threatened to slip following the killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, they turned to an unpredictable rival.
At meetings in the Iranian holy city of Qom, they struck a deal with populist Shi'ite cleric Sayyed Moqtada al-Sadr, who commands a following of millions of Iraqis.
According to senior Iraqi officials and militia insiders, they promised Sadr a greater say forming a new Iraqi government and an augmented spiritual leadership role among Shi'ite paramilitary groups.
In return, he would draw on his mass following to weaken the anti-government and anti-Iran dissent that has erupted on Iraqi streets, and redirect the unrest toward demands for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, the sources said.
The agreement, sponsored by Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group, sought to preserve Shi'ite power in Iraq by uniting the factions of the Iran-backed groups with their rival Sadr.
The militias were in disarray after a U.S. air strike killed Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis on Jan. 3. 
Sadr was also off-balance. He had led anti-government unrest in previous years but did not control the latest round of anger against the political elite in spontaneous, leaderless demonstrations that broke out in October.
With the deal struck, Sadr - an opportunist who has at different times fought the United States, decried Iranian meddling, and supported then abandoned protests - now looks set to have a big say in the selection of a new government which must be picked by next Monday, officials and lawmakers say.
The previous cabinet resigned under protest pressure last year.
After Soleimani's killing, Iran and Hezbollah officials instructed pro-Iran militia leaders to put aside their differences with Sadr. The two sides had clashed in parliament and over government posts last year in an intra-Shi'ite power struggle.
They met in Qom - Sadr's new base as he pursues further religious study.
""Iran saw Sadr as the only solution to prevent the collapse of Shi'ite power under protest pressure and the weakening of factions it backs,"" an aide to Sadr who traveled to Qom said, requesting anonymity.
""Sadr has the popular base through which he might control the street. They wanted to use that.""
Several paramilitary sources with knowledge of the meetings confirmed that the Iranian side asked Sadr, who comes from an influential clerical family with a history of leading anti-government insurrection under Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein, to use his following to control demonstrations.
In return Sadr demanded freedom to choose the next government and to be able to block the Iran-backed parties' preferences. ""Iran did not oppose this,"" the aide to Sadr said.
Two paramilitary sources said Sadr demanded control of two ministries under Prime Minister-designate Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi, who has asked parliament to approve his government this week.
The militia groups also agreed Sadr could have an augmented symbolic role leading them in opposition to the United States, the paramilitary sources said.
""The resistance factions agreed Sadr would be the main voice in the resistance. The groups will in return support decisions he makes,"" said Nasr al-Shammari, a spokesman for the Iran-backed and U.S.-sanctioned Nujaba paramilitary faction.
Shammari and two other paramilitary sources said Iraq's militia groups would consider a greater role for the head of Sadr's Peace Brigades militia, Abu Doaa al-Essawi, in coordinating their military strategy.
The groups have been seeking a replacement for Muhandis, expected to be a commander from the late militia leader's own group, Kataib Hezbollah.
Government officials and parliamentarians say Sadr will have significant influence over the cabinet line-up proposed by Allawi, which the premier has said will consist of independent candidates.
""If this cabinet passes it'll work well for Sadr. He prefers independents because they're weak and he can coopt them. He has a militia and the ability to intimidate people,"" a government official said.
Kurdish and Sunni politicians oppose the line-up being pushed by Sadr, fearing they stand to lose portfolios.
SHORT TERM GAINS
Sadr might make political gains in the short term. But his deal with Iran-backed groups has alienated many supporters.
""They stole our revolution, the militias and the Peace Brigades (Sadr's own militia),"" protester Mahdi Abdul Zahra said as he watched police fire at his friends in Baghdad.
Sadr's followers, who had joined protests and sometimes protected demonstrators from violence by security forces and militiamen, abandoned protest camps on his instructions and subsequently attacked them.
Sadr has threatened to call a new ""million-strong"" rally to pressure parliament to approve the new cabinet - another move that could eclipse the original demonstrations that demand the fall of the entire Iraqi ruling elite.
Sadr issued an array of contradictory statements in early February. They called for a large protest demanding the withdrawal of U.S. forces, then for his supporters to abandon anti-government protests, then rejoin them but cleanse them of alcohol and other vices.
Followers took over some protest sites and clashed with demonstrators, killing several people.
""We rejected Sadr's initial call to withdraw from protests and were angry with him,"" said Sheikh Shiyaa al-Bahadli, a tribal leader in Baghdad's poor Sadr City district.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - President Sebastian Pinera called on Chileans on Monday to help the country ""live in peace"" ahead of an anticipated fresh outbreak of protests in March.
Pinera said stability was needed to allow for an effective public vote on a new constitution in April and to be able to push through reforms to pension, salaries and health services.
""What the country urgently needs is a great national agreement against violence and in defense of democracy,"" Pinera told journalists after a cabinet meeting at the Moneda presidential palace.
March is traditionally a month that brings protests in Chile as people return from the Southern (NYSE:SO) Hemisphere summer holiday and mark the anniversaries of victims of the 1973-1990 military dictatorship, and international women's day.
The results of educational government loan and grant applications can also spark unrest.
Protests broke out in Chile in October and raged until mid-December over the high cost of living and entrenched inequality. Associated violence saw metro stations burned, shops looted and set on fire, and a fierce response from police.
At least 31 people died, thousands were injured and tens of thousands arrested.
Protests have been muted in the capital in the new year but resumed with intensity in regional cities including Valparaiso and  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO).
On Friday, the Santiago square which was the focal point of last year's protests saw another large demonstration.
On Sunday, an annual music festival in Vina del Mar headlined by Ricky Martin, saw police clash with hooded protesters outside the heavily fortified event. Cars were torched and the windows of a well-known hotel were smashed.
A poll by Cadem poll published last week showed that 56% of respondents supported the continuation of protests, compared to 72% in October. 13% said they approved of Pinera's leadership, compared to 9% at the start of the month.
Another Cadem poll showed that 85% of business leaders felt Chile was moving in the ""wrong direction"", and 99% believed March would bring further polarization. Local media reports suggest businesses are investing heavily in security guards and iron gates to protect their premises.
""Public discontent remains considerable despite the government’s announcements of higher public spending and the process to rewrite the constitution, while distrust of the political class is widespread,"" analysts Eurasia Group said in a note."

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - A prominent Tanzanian journalist arrested in July was released on Monday after pleading guilty of tax evasion and money laundering in a case critics had said was politically motivated.
After Erick Kabendera acknowledged both crimes in court and agreed to fines of nearly 275 million shillings ($119,305.86), magistrate Janeth Mtega ruled he be freed.
""Finally I've got my freedom, it's quite unexpected that I would be out this soon. I'm really grateful to everybody who played their role,"" the 39-year-old investigative reporter said outside court.
In the charge sheet, prosecutors said Kabendera had with his wife - who was not detained or charged - registered two companies which were used as ""vehicles of money laundering"" without proper returns being filed.
Though his lawyers had originally rejected the charges, in October they said he was pursuing a plea bargain.
The reporter has written for international publications including Britain's Guardian and Times and was known for pursuing politically-sensitive investigations.
One article last year published by the East African newspaper reported a rift in President John Magufuli's government with the headline ""No end in sight as Tanzania's ruling party CCM goes for 'dissenters'.""
After he was arrested at his home last year, the United States and Britain called the affair ""irregular"" and in violation of Tanzania's criminal procedures law.
Rights groups saw the case as part of a pattern of tighter control on the media since the 2015 election of Magufuli.
""The outrageous fabricated charges against him show the intolerance of the Tanzanian authorities to any criticism,"" Amnesty International said in a statement last year.
Magufuli's administration has shut down newspapers, fined some critical outlets, arrested opposition leaders and restricted political rallies.
The government denies it is muzzling the media.
Several hours after the ruling, the journalist's lawyer Jebra Kambole said he had paid the 100 million shilling fine for one of the charges and would pay the other within six months.
A third charge, of assisting a criminal racket, was dropped.
Held at the Segerea maximum security prison on the outskirts of the capital Dar es Salaam, the journalist had appeared in court more than ten times, sometimes appearing frail.
In September, Magufuli said that people held on charges of tax evasion, money laundering and other financial crimes should be freed if they confess and return the cash."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU) said on Monday they would hold a congress on April 25 to pick a new leader who they want to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel, scrambling to resolve a crisis shaking the party's hold on power.
The decision on the succession timetable came after voters saddled the CDU with its worst result in a state vote in Hamburg on Sunday, punishing it for flirting with the far right in an eastern state and hastening a messy leadership battle.
The CDU succession debate was blown wide open earlier this month when party leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer unexpectedly said she would no longer seek to succeed her mentor Merkel.
""A new party chairman or chairwoman will be elected at this party congress,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer said of the April 25 meeting. ""This is a clear signal for the CDU candidate for chancellor.""
Merkel, chancellor for almost 15 years, has said she will not run again in the next federal election, due by October 2021.
Kramp-Karrenbauer, tasked by the party with organizing the succession, said she had agreed the timetable and procedure with the four leadership contenders to have come forward so far.
The four are Armin Laschet, premier of North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany's most populous state; Friedrich Merz, who narrowly lost a 2018 battle for the chair to Kramp-Karrenbauer; Health Minister Jens Spahn; and Norbert Roettgen, head of parliament's foreign affairs committee.
Many analysts believe a cohabitation arrangement of party chair and chancellor would be more difficult if Merz, an erstwhile rival of Merkel, captures the CDU leadership.
The center-left Social Democrats - junior partners in Merkel's ruling coalition - have signaled they could quit the government if she is forced out as chancellor.
Kramp-Karrenbauer stressed the party's top brass expected the winner of the leadership contest to work alongside Merkel.
""Everyone assumes that there will be good cooperation with both the Bundestag parliamentary group and the CDU-led federal government - and this is certainly a question and a requirement that all candidates will have to meet,"" she told reporters.
Kramp-Karrenbauer's decision to give up her ambition of succeeding Merkel came after an eastern branch of the CDU defied the national party and voted with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) to install a state premier from a third party.
That broke a post-World War Two consensus among established parties in Germany that the far right should be shunned.
In Hamburg, the CDU slipped into third place, scoring just 11.2% in the northern port city - behind the SPD, for whom the city is a stronghold, and the Greens.

Mass-selling daily Bild dubbed the Hamburg result a ""debacle"" for the CDU, whose faltering leadership has raised questions over the future course of Europe's largest economy.

481,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 08:51AM ET</span>","Julian Assange put lives at risk, lawyer for United States says","By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Julian Assange is wanted for crimes that put at risk the lives of people in Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan who had helped the West, some of whom later disappeared, said a lawyer acting for the United States in its bid to extradite him. 
Almost a decade since his WikiLeaks website enraged Washington by leaking hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. documents, Assange, 48, is fighting extradition from Britain to the United States where he is accused of espionage and hacking.
He was wanted, said James Lewis, lawyer for the U.S. authorities, not because he embarrassed the authorities but because he put informants, dissidents, and rights activists at risk of torture, abuse or death.
""What Mr Assange seems to defend by freedom of speech is not the publication of the classified materials but the publication of the names of the sources, the names of people who had put themselves at risk to assist the United States and its allies,"" Lewis said at London's Woolwich Crown Court. 
Supporters hail Assange as an anti-establishment hero who revealed governments' abuses of power, and argue the action against him is a dangerous infringement of journalists' rights.
Chants from 100 of his backers outside could be clearly heard inside. Assange himself complained about the din.
""I'm finding it difficult concentrating,"" said a clean-shaven Assagne, dressed in a blue-grey suit. ""This noise is not helping either. I understand and am very appreciative of the public support. They must be disgusted...""
Judge Vanessa Baraitser warned those in the public gallery not to disturb the proceedings.
The United States asked Britain to extradite Assange last year after he was pulled from the Ecuador embassy in London, where he had spent seven years holed up avoiding extradition to Sweden over sex crime allegations which have since been dropped.
Assange has served a prison sentence in Britain for skipping bail and remains jailed pending the U.S. extradition request.
Jennifer Robinson, one of Assange's lawyers, has said his case could lead to criminalising activities crucial to investigative journalists, and his work had shed light on how the United States conducted its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
""We are talking about collateral murder, evidence of war crimes,"" she said last week. ""They are a remarkable resource for those of us seeking to hold governments to account for abuses."" 
Lewis, speaking on behalf of the U.S. authorities, said hundreds of people across the world had to be warned after the WikiLeaks disclosures. Some had to be relocated. Others later disappeared, he said, although he said the United States would not try to prove that was directly a result of the disclosures.
Some WikiLeaks information was found at Osama bin Laden's hideout in Pakistan, he added.
HERO OR ENEMY?
The United States has charged Assange with 18 criminal counts of conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law. Lewis said Assange had conspired with Chelsea Manning, then a U.S. soldier known as Bradley Manning, to hack Department of Defense computers. 
He said Assange's defense team was guilty of hyperbole by suggesting Assange might receive a U.S. jail term of 175 years. Similar cases had led to terms of about 40-60 months, he said.
Assange attracted a host of well-known backers, with those criticizing the case against him ranging from leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn to Roger Waters, co-founder of rock group Pink Floyd. Designer Vivienne Westwood was among protesters outside court.
In addition to releasing military records, WikiLeaks angered Washington by publishing secret U.S. diplomatic cables that laid bare critical U.S. appraisals of world leaders. Assange made headlines in 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 U.S. helicopter strike in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff.
The hearing will not decide if Assange is guilty of any wrongdoing, but whether the extradition request meets the requirements set out under a 2003 UK-U.S. treaty, which critics say is stacked in Washington's favor.

The case will get under way before being postponed until May 18, when it will resume again for a further three weeks to allow both sides more time to gather evidence.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 08:25AM ET</span>",'RIP Democracy': Thai students protest party ban as opposition grills PM in parliament,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Hundreds of Thai students protested on Monday against the dissolution of a popular opposition party as Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and five cabinet ministers faced the first day of a censure debate in parliament.
Tension has been rising since Friday when the Constitutional Court dissolved the Future Forward Party, the third largest party in parliament and a vocal critic of the military establishment, for taking loans from its founder.
The court's decision sparked small protests around the country through the weekend and was widely condemned by democracy advocates.
Students at Chulalongkorn University in central Bangkok laid out a funeral wreath labeled ""RIP Democracy"" as hundreds gathered and made speeches condemning the court decision.
Across the city, hundreds more students gathered at Kasetsart University and chanted ""Prayuth get out"" in support of the censure motion.
The motion is likely to fail, in part because a ban on some Future Forward lawmakers increased Prayuth's coalition majority.
But the public debate represents the fiercest criticism he has faced since he transitioned last year from military ruler to head of an elected government.
Prayuth, who first came to power in a 2014 military coup, is accused by the remaining opposition parties of coming to power through non-democratic means, ineffective administration, abuse of power, corruption and trading favors for big businesses.
""Prime Minister Prayuth ... allows corruption to thrive and uses the power of his position to benefit himself and others,"" Sompong Amornvivat, the leader of the Pheu Thai party and the opposition bloc, said during the opening of the censure debate.
The prime minister denied the allegations during the debate, which will continue until Thursday. A vote of no confidence against the Prime Minister and five other cabinet ministers is scheduled to take place on Friday.
On Sunday, the former spokeswoman of the Future Forward Party accused Prayuth's military junta of helping Malaysia's former government cover up a multi-billion dollar corruption scandal at sovereign fund 1Malaysia Developments Bhd.
Prayuth rejected the allegation and threaten to sue the spokeswoman, Pannika Wanich, who was among the Future Forward leaders barred from politics last Friday.

""I told related agencies to investigate,"" Prayuth told reporters. ""If there is anything that can be sued they will do so.""

483,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 08:19AM ET</span>","With once-radical Podemos tamed, Spain's new coalition is happy - for now","By Belén Carreño
MADRID (Reuters) - Just last year, Spain's struggling prime minister said he would not be able to sleep at night had he made a pact with the hard left Unidas Podemos party to secure power.
Now, Pedro Sanchez' new best friends are the once-radical movement, born out of anti-austerity ""indignados"" protests, who have enabled him to retain the premiership and joined him since January in Spain's first coalition government in decades.
Once avowedly anti-establishment Podemos leaders stood in the front row to applaud the King of Spain in parliament this month and sit down weekly with members of Sanchez' Socialist Party at meetings nicknamed ""matins"" for morning prayers. 
""We are living a sweet moment,"" one Socialist leader told Reuters, acknowledging surprise at the harmony, albeit still in early honeymoon stage, between the erstwhile rivals.
After years of political instability and repeated elections in Spain, the coalition's early optics and concrete policy progress have soothed worries around the European Union and in the financial community of the bloc's fourth largest economy.
But the partners do not agree on everything, coalition sources stressed. So without a parliamentary majority, their so-called ""pact of the hug"" could be strained in looming negotiations with Catalan separatists and conservative opposition parties whose cooperation is needed for reforms.
FIRST TEST PASSED
Some fear the unlikely coalition could eventually unravel, as happened recently in Italy.
For now, though, and despite a history of personal animosity between Sanchez and Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias - who previously avoided eye contact and seldom talked - there have been no rows and the junior coalition member is toeing the line.
That enabled them to pass their first major test earlier this month, agreeing on a multi-year fiscal framework that envisages a reduction of the deficit and debt.
""Unidas Podemos wants to launch measures that involve a lot of spending, and it is true that it's going to be difficult because of budgetary restrictions,"" a Podemos member of government told Reuters. ""But we have accepted that the broad figures that have been put forward are the right ones.""
Embryonic tensions on issues from immigration to sexual crimes reform have been swiftly quelled by Iglesias, whose past criticism of the Socialists has given way to reassurances.
""In Spain, there is going to be a united and firm government,"" he said last week.
Sources on both sides described a tight-knit communication system and regular meetings to deter in-fighting. Chief of staff Ivan Redondo and Unidas Podemos communications director Juanma del Olmo have been pivotal to that, the sources say, while former Socialist premier Jose Luis Zapatero is also providing Iglesias with advice.
While last year Iglesias complained Sanchez would not even call him on his mobile, now the deputy prime minister lunches one-on-one with him every two weeks at his boss's residence, sources close to Sanchez said.
The early Monday morning ""matins"" meetings between senior members of both parties set the agenda for the week and iron out disagreements, officials said. And at a government retreat in the countryside, the cabinet shared a cake for a Unidas Podemos minister's birthday, one participant said.
The party that once voiced the anger of the streets over the financial crisis is clear about its turn toward mainstream.
""If to raise the minimum wage or to make a comprehensive law to protect the sexual freedom of all people we have to applaud the head of state, obviously we are going to do it without any doubts,"" said Irene Montero, a Podemos minister.
Just a year earlier, the same Podemos lawmakers, then in opposition, had pointedly stayed seated as the king spoke.
CATALAN CHALLENGE
""It is good to have them in government rather than exerting pressure from the outside,"" a top Spanish banker told Reuters.
A senior EU source said the bloc's institutions were also relieved. ""We want Spain to have a government, any government,"" the source said, referring to the destabilizing string of four parliamentary elections in four years.
How long the harmony can last may depend on restive Catalonia. Separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) is already conditioning its approval for the budget on talks to address the region's independence drive.
Podemos was traditionally more open to separatists' demands than the Socialists - in particular accepting the idea of a referendum - but have now said they will stand behind Sanchez who opposes that.
The government also needs the support of the conservative People's Party to make senior appointments in major institutions like the Constitutional Court, which will not be easy.
Broad support is also required for labor and pension reforms.
""For now we can talk about positive surprises,"" said a Socialist source close to Sanchez. ""But difficult times may lie ahead in the coming months."""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia is under an ""unprecedented"" threat of foreign espionage and interference, one of the country's most senior spy chiefs said on Monday.
In a rare speech, Mike Burgess, Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) said a range of nations are seeking to influence lawmakers, government officials, media figures, business leaders and academics.
""The level of threat we face from foreign espionage and interference activities is currently unprecedented. It is higher now, than it was at the height of the Cold War,"" Burgess said in a speech in Canberra.
Burgess did not identify the countries seeking to interfere, but Reuters reported in September that Australia's intelligence agencies concluded China was responsible for a cyber-attack on the Australian parliament and three largest political parties.
China denies responsibility for the attack, which came just months before an general election in May 2018.
Australia decided not to reveal the identity of the attackers in order to protect its trading relationship with China, sources familiar with the decision told Reuters. 
China is Australia’s largest trading partner, buying more than a third of its total exports, including much of its iron ore, coal and agricultural goods, and sending more than a million tourists and students to Australia each year.
Burgess did not name specific attacks on Australia, but he referenced a spate of cyber-attacks.
ASIO had uncovered cases where foreign spies have traveled to Australia with the intention of setting up ""sophisticated hacking infrastructure"" targeting computers containing sensitive and classified information, Burgess said.
The speech comes just a few months after Australia's leading universities agreed to name overseas research partners, list financial dealings with other countries and share cyber intelligence with national security agencies to curb foreign interference.
Australia, a staunch ally of the United States and its escalating action against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, has been on high alert for attacks by home-grown militants. This has mostly concentrated on extremists returning from fighting in the Middle East or their supporters.
While highlighting the threat of foreign actors, Burgess also said the threat of right-wing extremists had grown, citing mass shooting at two mosques in Christchurch in March in 2018.

""In suburbs around Australia, small cells regularly meet to salute Nazi flags, inspect weapons, train in combat and share their hateful ideology,"" Burgess said.

485,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",British spies deny withholding intelligence from interior minister,"LONDON (Reuters) - British intelligence took the unusual step on Monday of denying a newspaper report that the main domestic spy agency, MI5, had withheld information from the interior minister because some spies did not trust her.
The Sunday Times reported that the Security Service, known as MI5, did not trust Home Secretary Priti Patel and so had reduced the volume of intelligence they showed to her.
The newspaper said spies regularly ""roll their eyes"" at the minister's interventions during meetings.
A security source said the report was untrue.
""No information is being withheld,"" said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""Any report suggesting otherwise is simply wrong and does not serve the public interest."" 
""Reports suggesting that the Home Secretary and MI5 do not have a strong relationship are simply untrue,"" said the source. ""The Home Secretary is briefed daily on intelligence matters in exactly the same way as any previous post holder.""
MI5, established in 1909 to counter German espionage ahead of World War One, is tasked with protecting British national security. Its main job is currently countering international terrorism though it is also a counter-intelligence agency.
It employs around 4,000 people and is accountable to the Home Secretary.
""The Home Secretary and MI5 have a strong and close working relationship, and baseless claims to the contrary are both wrong and against the public interest,"" a government spokesman said.
""The Home Secretary receives the same daily intelligence briefings as her predecessors, and no information is being withheld.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has full confidence in Patel, his spokesman said."

BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - With its slogan ""Let's beat the mafia together"", Igor Matovic's anti-graft movement has ridden a wave of public anger over corruption to emerge as the unexpected favorite to oust Slovakia's ruling party in a Feb. 29 election.
The vote is the first since the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak in 2018 prompted mass street protests, forced the resignation of then-Prime Minister Robert Fico and launched a number of investigations into cozy ties between politicians, business and justice officials.
An influential businessman is on trial charged with orchestrating the murder.
""In this atmosphere, I feel it on the streets, people in Slovakia have risen up to say that is enough,"" Matovic told Reuters.
Matovic, 46, expressed surprise at the meteoric rise of his Ordinary People and Independent Personalities (OLANO) in the opinion polls, which have put it almost neck-and-neck with the ruling left-leaning Smer party.
""We thought we would take third or fourth place but it is now possible that we come first,"" he said, adding he had yet to decide whether he would want to serve as prime minister.
The party's election campaign stunts have included lighting 5,000 candles outside the government building to symbolize deaths that OLANO says were caused by shortfalls in healthcare funding due to corruption.
OLANO has promised to enact policies on social spending and fighting corruption that people support in its ongoing internet survey if it sweeps to power.
Matovic also took a swipe at right-wing governments in neighboring Hungary and Poland that have clashed with the EU over the rule of law and media freedoms, saying: ""We want to show in this election that central Europe has not gone crazy."""
487,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 07:29AM ET</span>","At talks, Libyan government demands Haftar forces withdraw","GENEVA (Reuters) - Libya's government took a firm position at peace talks in Switzerland on Monday, demanding that renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar withdraw from the ramparts of the capital and describing him as a ""war criminal"".
The internationally recognized government nearly walked out of talks last week aimed at creating a ceasefire in Tripoli, which eastern commander Haftar has been trying to capture. The government blamed Haftar's forces for shelling Tripoli's port shortly after the talks got under way.
Since being persuaded by a U.N. envoy to stay, the government side has taken a hard line in public, saying there can be no deal while Haftar's forces remain in place.
""Our delegation is insisting that forces of Haftar have to withdraw from where they are now,"" foreign affairs minister Mohamed Syala told journalists.
Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj labeled Haftar a ""war criminal"" at a meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council, held in the same headquarters building where the peace talks have taken place.
""Children have lost their right to education due to the shelling and the closure of schools because of the attacker and those who fund the attacker and provide weapons, these must be held accountable,"" Serraj told the forum.
Nearly nine years since NATO-backed rebels overthrew dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya is still without a central authority in control of its towns and cities. Armed groups patrol the streets, while rival governments are in place in Tripoli and the east.
The most powerful figure in the east, Haftar, launched a bid last year to capture the capital in the west. He has support of countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the Tripoli government is backed by Turkey. 
Syala said he was ""astonished"" that the international community had not forced Haftar to reopen oil fields that he has shut in recent weeks and end a blockade which has cut off nearly all of Libya's access to funds.

He said one reason could be a desire by big countries to keep oil prices high, ""and if that's the reason it is inhuman"".

YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar student union said on Monday police were seeking to press charges against nine of its members for organizing a protest against an eight-month-long internet shutdown in the restive west of the country.
Around 100 students gathered in the commercial capital of Yangon on Sunday demanding an end to the internet cut-off in Rakhine and Chin states, where civilian casualties are mounting as government troops battle ethnic rebels.
A case has been filed under section 19 of the Peaceful Assembly Law, which outlaws unauthorized assemblies and carries a maximum three-month prison sentence, the Arakan Student Union said in a statement on Sunday.
""We are students and citizens pointing out the wrongdoings of government,"" Kyaw Linn, one of the students who took part, told Reuters by phone. ""They violated our citizens' rights."" 
He said six of the students had been taken into police custody.
An officer from Yangon's Kamaryut township, where the protest took place, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Another hung up the phone. A government spokesman did not answer phone calls seeking comment.
Authorities shut down mobile internet access in nine townships in Chin and Rakhine, also known as Arakan, last June citing security reasons. While the block was later lifted in five townships, it was reinstated in early February.
Protests against the shutdown were also held in two townships of Rakhine state on Saturday.
If convicted, the students face a fine or up to three months in jail or both.
Rakhine state was the site of a military crackdown in 2017 that forced more than 730,000 minority Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh. The army described the crackdown as a legitimate counter-insurgency operation in response to attacks on security forces by Rohingya militants.
The region has been plunged into further chaos since December 2018 by fighting between the military and insurgents from the Arakan Army, which recruits from the mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine majority and is demanding greater autonomy.

Kang Kyung-wha, addressing the U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament, said the goal remained complete denuclearisation on the divided Korean peninsula.
""A speedy resumption of the U.S.-DPRK negotiations is critical so that all stakeholders maintain and build upon the hard-won momentum for dialogue. We stand ready to engage with the North in a way that facilitates and accelerates the U.S.-DPRK dialogue,"" Kang told the Geneva forum.
South Korea was promoting projects with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, she said, using the formal name of the isolated country.
""And we will do so adhering faithfully to the international sanctions regime on the DPRK,"" Kang added.
North Korea has been subjected to U.N. sanctions since 2006. They have been strengthened by the Security Council over the years in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
North Korea continued to enhance its nuclear and ballistic missile programs last year in breach of United Nations sanctions, according to a confidential U.N. report seen by Reuters in New York this month.
North Korea told the Geneva talks last month that as the United States had ignored its year-end deadline for nuclear talks, it no longer felt bound by commitments, which included a halt to its nuclear testing and the firing of inter-continental ballistic missiles.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamad unexpectedly resigned as prime minister on Monday, leaving the Southeast Asian country in political turmoil but drawing calls from some quarters for the world's oldest leader to return at the head of a new government.
The resignation of Mahathir, 94, breaks apart a coalition with old rival Anwar Ibrahim, 72, that had won a surprise election victory in 2018 and was not part of a pre-election promise that Mahathir would one day cede power to Anwar.
The decision, which Mahathir did not explain, follows surprise talks at the weekend between members of his coalition and the opposition on forming a new government.
But Anwar and people close to Mahathir said he had quit after accusations that he would form some sort of partnership with opposition parties he defeated less than two years ago on an anti-corruption platform. 
""He thought that he shouldn't be treated in that manner, to associate him in working with those we believe are blatantly corrupt,"" Anwar told reporters after meeting Mahathir on Monday morning. 
""He made it very clear that in no way would he work with those associated with the previous regime,"" Anwar said. 
But it is unclear if the resignation is end of the road for Mahathir: at least two of the component parties from his coalition called for Mahathir to stay on as prime minister. Some in the opposition have also agreed to support him. 
""The field is wide open for him,"" said Ibrahim Suffian, director of pollster Merdeka. ""If he considers coming back as PM, he has the freedom to choose his partners or who he would like to be part of his cabinet.""  
Mahathir's office said he has sent his letter of resignation to the king and he was later seen arriving at the palace to meet the monarch. 
Mahathir, who came out of retirement to run in the 2018 national election, also quit the Bersatu party he had formed shortly before the polls, three sources familiar with the matter said. 
'UP FOR GRABS'
Mahathir's resignation capped over 24 hours of speculation over the fate of the coalition after lawmakers from his coalition held meetings on Sunday with the opposition United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and Islamist party PAS. 
It is unclear what the political leaders of the country are planning next or who could form the next government. 
Sources say there could be a showdown between Anwar and an alliance between Bersatu President Muhyiddin Yassin and Azmin Ali, who on Monday was sacked from Anwar's party. 
Constitutionally, any lawmaker who can command a majority in parliament can stake a claim to form the government. The king has to provide his assent before a prime minister can be sworn in. 
If no one has simple majority of 112 lawmakers, fresh elections are an option, a person close to Mahathir's party said.
In public comments today, Anwar did not say if he would stake a claim to form a new government. He said he met the king to express his views and seek the king's advice in the interest of the country. 
""Seems like it will be up for grabs now,"" a second source said about the possibility of who will form the next government. ""Who can pull in a majority.""
The political turmoil, together with region-wide worries at the spread of the coronavirus, sent Malaysia's currency, bonds and stock market lower.
The ringgit fell 0.8% on the day - its steepest slide in three years - to its lowest level in almost six months.
The main stock market index fell to an eight-year low and bonds fell, forcing yields on 10-year government bonds up 5 basis points, their biggest jump since October.
""It becomes quite hard for Malaysia to bring foreign investors back,"" Jolynn Kek, head of equity at BOS Wealth Management Malaysia, said, pointing to more political stability and economic growth among its neighbors.
Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng, whose DAP party is the second biggest component of Mahathir's coalition, said ""political manipulation"" has affected the government's efforts to address the economy. 
Lim's party said it would re-nominate Mahathir to be the prime minister. 

Mahathir had been scheduled to announce a stimulus package to deal with the virus outbreak on Thursday.

493,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>","A police raid, viral videos and the broken lives of Nigerian gay law suspects","By Alexis Akwagyiram
LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuters) - The 57 men stumbled out of the back of a dark police truck into the glare of a sunny courtyard and a phalanx of cameras. Some clutched another's hand, as if for comfort. They lined up on wooden benches in the dirt, almost all of them trying to hide their faces, and not succeeding.
Standing behind a bank of microphones, the Lagos state police commissioner, Imohimi Edgal, told the gathered journalists that he personally had ordered the raid that swept up the men after the authorities received a tipoff that young men were being initiated into a ""homosexual club.""
Edgal declared that homosexuality ran contrary to the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act. That law, which drew international condemnation when it came into force in 2014, targets not only same-sex unions but homosexual relations in general with prison terms of up to 14 years.
""It is the duty of everybody, not only the police, to ensure that such antisocial behavior, such social vices, such crimes, are checked so that we can create communities that protect our children from such deviant behavior,"" he said.
The cameras panned over the faces of the men, capturing expressions of shame, fear and anger. Most of them remained quiet, but others answered journalists' questions.
""What is the definition of a gay? It is when you are caught having sex, intercourse, with a guy. They didn't caught me,"" shouted James Brown, a wiry young man who said he had been hired to dance at a birthday party and had done nothing wrong.
The phrase ""they didn't caught me"" quickly went viral. Video footage of the August 2018 news conference has since been viewed more than half a million times. Friends, colleagues and strangers all learned of the allegations from the videos that circulated online.
Last November, after more than a year of court hearings, Brown was among 47 men who pleaded not guilty to a charge of public displays of affection by people of the same sex. Arrest warrants were issued for the 10 other men who failed to appear in court. In a landmark case that may reach its resolution this month, the men face 10 years in prison if found guilty under the 2014 law, which has never been used to secure a conviction.
But prison time or no, the men have already been punished. In this resolutely Christian and Muslim country, homosexuality is broadly rejected across society, as casual as a snub on the street and as serious as Sharia law that threatens death by stoning.
One of the men is a married father of four who says he had driven people to the party to earn extra money. For a time, he went without electricity because he couldn't pay the bills after being fired; even in the darkness of his house, the strain between him and his wife was visible to a visiting Reuters journalist. Another man slept in a church outhouse after his family threw him out, until he was finally cast out of that safe harbor, too. A third man lives in fear of the street toughs who have beaten him up three times after recognizing him from the viral videos of the perp walk. And the man who was celebrating his birthday avoided arrest but is now overwhelmed by guilt, seeing blame even in his friends' eyes.
These are the stories of lives broken by a birthday party late one night in Lagos – and by a culture that cast the men adrift.
THE FAMILY MAN
Around 2 on a Sunday morning, they streamed out of the building, running in every direction. Within seconds, the birthday party at a Lagos hotel turned into a stampede as people fled armed policemen who had burst into the compound.
""I couldn't understand what was happening,"" said Onyeka Oguaghamba, a trade union officer who used a borrowed car as a taxi at weekends. ""Was it armed robbers or a fire?""
Oguaghamba had been dozing in the car park of the Kelly Ann Hotel. After a long journey driving three customers to the hotel in the Egbeda suburb, he said, he had decided to sleep in the car rather than risk a perilous journey home on potholed roads where he could encounter armed robbers.
Assuming the dozens of people who raced past him were fleeing danger, Oguaghamba said, he got out of the car and ran. Before he could reach the hotel compound's gates, however, he was pulled to the ground and struck repeatedly on his head. Seconds later, he said, he realized he was being held by a policeman using a gun as a bludgeon. Lagos state police spokesman Bala Elkana declined to comment on the beating claim on the grounds that the raid predated him. He rejected emailed and text message requests to speak to police officers who participated in the raid.
The impact on Oguaghamba's life was swift. After two weeks in police detention, he was fired as a bookkeeper with the Nigeria Union Of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, a job he had held for eight years. His employers had seen the videos on social media and didn't believe his explanation, he said. His former manager declined to respond to text messages and phone calls from a journalist.
The 42-year-old, who insists he is not gay, was unable to find work for a year after his arrest. Finally, in December, he was hired as a driver for a transport company.
Even his four boys – aged 6, 7 and two 10-year-olds – weren't immune from the innuendo that swirled around their father. While he was in police detention, they were told their father had been on television.
""I felt so bad, although they didn't understand what gay means,"" he said. ""They asked me ­why police arrested me and they were showing me on television. I explained to them that the police can arrest anybody at any time.""
Walking past locals in his Lagos neighborhood, Oguaghamba greeted people with ""good morning,"" as is customary across Nigeria. Most returned the greeting, but some, particularly men, seemed reluctant to acknowledge him, barely nodding in response and looking away.
There was tension at home too.
""When I came back from that Ikoyi prison, people talked a lot to my wife. They tell her a lot of things,"" he said, referring to those who questioned his motives for being at the hotel that night.
Wedding photos of Oguaghamba, known to most people by his Christian name Miracle, and his wife, Juliette, take pride of place on the living room walls. But as the couple discussed the case with a visiting journalist recently, they rarely made eye contact; he looked at the floor, and she fixed her gaze straight ahead.
While he was being detained, Juliette sent protection money to an inmate so he would be spared the beatings that he says many of the others he was arrested with were subjected to.
""She suffered a lot to bail me out,"" Oguaghamba said. Aside from the money, there was the indignity of a policewoman at the station accusing Juliette of having a gay husband. ""When I got back, we started having issues.""
Finally, relations improved after a family meeting was convened at which her elder sister acted as a mediator between the couple.
""Because of the incident, it was very difficult for us,"" Juliette said. ""There is no evidence. You can't just barge into a hotel and pick people,"" she said, her voice growing louder.
""I know my husband very well. He doesn't play such games. This is 11 years of marriage,"" she said. ""It makes me cry. It makes me angry because he lost a lot.""
The house was dark at the time because the electricity had been turned off weeks after the annual rent was due in October. Oguaghamba said he was able to pay some, but not all, of the money. The landlord has threatened to evict the family if it can't pay the outstanding sum.
Oguaghamba said he was angry at the way his life had been upended.
""I'm angry because what they are saying is not fact,"" he said. ""They shared my pictures and video on social media. It's a very shameful thing.""
THE POLICE
The Lagos police force has yet to disclose what its officers saw during the raid that led to the charge of public displays of same-sex affection against Oguaghamba and the other men.
Since the November arraignment, the judge has adjourned the case three times because prosecution lawyers were unable to produce their witnesses. The judge threatened to throw out the case if the prosecution didn't produce its key witness at the next hearing in March. 
Police officials rejected a Reuters request for the police commissioner to provide details of the evidence that prompted the mass arrest and charges. Spokesman Elkana said the current commissioner wasn't in the job at the time and therefore couldn't comment.
Edgal, the commissioner who said he personally ordered the raid, left office early last year for a commissioner position in southern Nigeria. He didn't respond to requests for comment on the raid.
But in a wide-ranging media briefing with journalists in January, the current Lagos commissioner, Hakeem Odumosu, spoke broadly about the application of the same-sex law.
""As police officers, we are to enforce the laws,"" he said. ""So on the same-sex marriage now, we stand by the position of the law.""
Nigeria hasn't disclosed how many people have been detained under the law. But based on reports of mass police raids, Reuters estimates that the number is likely to run into the hundreds each year. Information is also scarce on the number of prosecutions, but activist groups say they know of none.
Xeenarh Mohammed, executive director of Nigerian rights group the Initiative for Equal Rights, which has been providing legal and counseling support for the men arrested in the raid, said the law prohibiting same-sex unions ""has simply been used again and again and again to harass people, to pick people for perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.""
The accusation of extortion and police harassment also has been leveled by international rights campaigners. In a 2016 report, Human Rights Watch cited a number of alleged victims of police officers who had used the threat of a prison sentence to extort money from them.
In interviews with Reuters, five people who acknowledged having same-sex relationships said that police in Lagos use that fear and the threat of the law to extort money from men.
Nigerian police have repeatedly denied the claim. Nigeria's attorney-general and a spokesman for the Justice Ministry didn't respond to text messages and phone calls seeking comment on the accusations.
In addition to the national same-sex law, 12 of Nigeria's 36 states apply Sharia law. In those states, in the predominantly Muslim north of the country, same-sex acts carry maximum penalties of death for men and whipping and/or imprisonment for women. Cases are infrequent, however, which means the punishment is rarely carried out.
Gay people in Lagos say they live in fear of their sexuality becoming publicly known. Members of the gay community said they arrange discreet private gatherings such as house parties in the homes of friends. Many also turn to dating apps and social media to set up romantic liaisons. But criminals sometimes use these secret rendezvous to carry out attacks known locally as ""kito,"" in which a gay person arrives to meet a person for the first time only to be kidnapped, beaten and sometimes raped, said rights campaigners and two people who told Reuters they had been victims of such attacks.
THE MAN WHO BROUGHT SHAME
When he was a child, Chris Agiriga said, his aunt gave him a home after his mother left Lagos to pursue a new life. Some 20 years later, his aunt told him to leave after he appeared on TV in the police line-up.
""Everyone in the area knew about it,"" said the 23-year-old from Egbeda, the same district as the hotel. ""I brought shame upon the whole family.""
Agiriga's aunt took him to her church and arranged for her pastor to house him on the premises. Agiriga slept on the floor of an outhouse that he shared with another homeless man who had been taken in by the church.
The church pastor told Reuters that Agiriga was a vulnerable young man who had been taken advantage of. He wanted to help. But the arrangement ended after five months during which Agiriga clashed with his roommate. Agiriga said the roommate sent threatening text messages about turning him in to the police for ""his lifestyle."" When asked for his version of events, the roommate declined to offer an explanation and told a Reuters journalist to leave the church premises.
Agiriga now lives in a safe house for men in Lagos.
He says he lost his job as a community outreach worker with an HIV charity after his arrest. In Nigeria, unlike in other parts of the world, the condition is not primarily associated with gay communities but with unprotected sex in general.
""I called my director. He saw what happened on TV. He said he couldn't employ me because it brings shame,"" Agiriga said.
Olubiyi Oludipe, executive director of the Improved Sexual Health & Rights Advocacy Initiative, said Agiriga had already been ""disengaged"" when the raid happened but was unable to specify when. He said Agiriga's performance hadn't been satisfactory but declined to elaborate further.
""We have never laid off any of our project volunteers because of police arrest or based on sexual orientation and gender identity,"" he said in an emailed statement. ""We always treat everyone as equal.""
Before the raid, Agiriga wanted to pursue a career as a fashion designer. But he dropped out of his fashion course after losing the job that funded his studies. Agiriga now works as an HIV counselor for a nonprofit group.
Agiriga didn't even know the birthday celebrant. A friend invited him, he said, and he was reluctant but was persuaded to go.
Police raided the venue around 30 minutes after he arrived.
""I regret going to the party,"" he said. ""I lost my job, I lost my family, I lost a lot my friends – all because of this.""
THE TARGET
For one of the other suspects, the dominant emotion since the arrest has been fear.
Smart Joel said he has been beaten up three times by gangs of men known in Lagos as ""area boys"" who said they recognized him from the video. People still point and stare as he walks by, he said, although it was worse in the first few months following the video.
""I'm always scared,"" the diminutive 25-year-old said, recounting an attack that took place last year in which a group of men called him out as the ""gay guy who was arrested"" and stole his phone, money and wristwatch.
Before the arrest, he said, it was the police who made him fearful. ""Police officers will stop you and then get you arrested. Extort money from you and begin to call you names,"" Joel said. ""That is not what the law talks about. They tend to harass.""
Joel's livelihood has also suffered. He runs a laundry and dry-cleaning business from the room he shares with his mother and five younger siblings.
An iron and a chair draped with pressed clothes take up the tiny part of the floor not covered by the double bed shared by Joel's mother and his four sisters. But many customers have deserted him. ""The ones that saw the video stopped coming to me. My income became unstable,"" he said. The family has struggled to pay bills and buy food since then.
""It has not been easy,"" he said. ""At some point I had to move on, not minding the stigma, the discrimination and the dirty language.""
THE HOST
Most of those arrested in August 2018 had gathered to celebrate James Burutu's 24th birthday, a party that promised to last from ""10 pm till mama calls.""
The sense of guilt he has lived with since then has been made worse by the fact that he wasn't among those seized by police, he said.
He was still preparing for the party in a hotel room with friends when the raid took place; parties in Lagos often spill over well into the early hours of the day.
But even though he wasn't arrested, the raid also changed his life. He says he has been ostracized by relatives. ""So many of my family members don't want to see me because of this issue,"" he said.
His elder sister asked him to leave the house she and her husband had shared with him. Three days of homelessness followed, during which he slept underneath a bridge, before he sought shelter with friends.
And, as with a number of those who were arrested, he says he was fired. ""My company said they didn't want to hear about a gay issue, and that if I continue working with them it would be a threat to the company,"" he said.
Eleganza, a Lagos-based company that produces plastic furniture, didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment on Burutu's claims. A staff member, in a phone call, said he couldn't comment.
Many of Burutu's friends, some of whom wondered aloud how he managed to evade arrest, now refuse to speak to him.
""My life has been shattered,"" he said.
JUSTICE
For the family man, Oguaghamba, his options look limited. If he is evicted, he might have to uproot his children from the only home they've ever known and return to his home state of Imo, in southeast Nigeria. He hasn't lived there in more than 20 years.
""I am not happy at all,"" he said, perched on a threadbare armchair in his living room.
Despite the setbacks, however, he remains optimistic about the future.
He maintains he is innocent and believes he finally has a chance to defend himself after seeing his image tarnished on social media.
""All my joy is that we are in the federal high court and that this matter will come to an end,"" he said. ""I believe that victory will be mine.""

494,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 04:49AM ET</span>",Japan plays down criticism of coronavirus cruise ship handling,"By Rocky Swift
TOKYO (Reuters) - A panel of Japanese medical experts on Monday sought to play down deepening criticism of the government's handling of a coronavirus outbreak on a cruise ship while acknowledging mistakes were made.
Confirmed cases on the British-registered Diamond Princess have reached 691 with three deaths since the ship docked at Yokohama port on Feb. 3.
The United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries evacuated their citizens from the ship before the end of a two-week quarantine period and are now imposing new quarantine or travel restrictions on those passengers.
Since the ship's quarantine ended on Feb. 19, passengers who have disembarked, most of them Japanese but including some foreigners, have been asked to stay at home and avoid public transport.
One Japanese passenger has a confirmed infection, while new cases have sprung up among returned Australians, Britons, and Americans.
""We could have done better, but that's common sense,"" Shigeru Omi, president of the Japan Community Healthcare Organization, and a government adviser on the crisis, said at a press briefing.
""No operation is perfect.""
But that relatively forgiving assessment is in contrast to growing criticism of how Japan handled the quarantine, just months ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the quarantine had not been sufficient to halt contagion.
Some critics have said that by attempting a quarantine on the ship, Japanese officials essentially turned the boat into a floating incubator for the coronavirus.
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato will announce on Tuesday new measures to help contain small outbreaks across Japan, domestic broadcaster NHK reported. On Saturday, he apologized for allowing an infected woman to leave the Diamond Princess.
The experts assembled on Monday, at a news conference for foreign media, did not accept assertions that the ship quarantine had been a failure.
They pointed to preliminary data showing that cases among Diamond Princess passengers appeared to peak on Feb. 7 before tailing off, evidence they contend was proof that the isolation strategy worked.
Cases among the crew continued to grow, however.
Evaluation of what authorities could have done better would have to wait until the crisis has subsided, Omi said.
""We are in the middle of a fight now,"" he said."

The U.S. Department of Justice estimates $4.5 billion was misappropriated from Malaysia's 1MDB between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise.
Malaysian prosecutors filed charges in December 2018 against the units, based in London, Hong Kong and Singapore, for misleading investors by making untrue statements and omitting key facts in relation to the 1MDB bond issues.
A representative for Goldman Sachs pleaded not guilty after the charges were read out at the Kuala Lumpur High Court on Monday, Bernama reported. 
The court set the trial for November, with hearings scheduled until April 2021, Bernama reported. 
Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing, saying that certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about how proceeds from the bond sales would be used.
Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, which was set up in 2009 by then prime minister Najib Razak.

Najib, who lost a general election in May 2018, is facing 42 criminal charges related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities. He has pleaded not guilty.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Four veteran Sherpa climbers left on Monday for Mount Everest on a mission to climb the world’s highest mountain in five days from the Nepali side, aiming to set a record for its shortest winter ascent in nearly three decades, hiking officials said.
If successful, the team led by 34-year-old Tashi Lakpa Sherpa, who has climbed Everest eight times, will be the first to climb the 8,850-metre (29,035-ft) peak in 27 years during winter, when freezing cold and shorter daylight hours make climbing difficult.
""We know it is extremely risky and difficult to climb Sagarmatha during the winter, but we are very well acclimatized and prepared for this,"" Sherpa told reporters, using the name by which Nepalis refer to Mount Everest.
""Ours is a strong team and we have confidence that we can do it,"" he added, before flying in a helicopter to base camp at Everest. 
Temperatures in the death zone of Everest, so-called because of thin air above its South Col, can drop as low as to -40 degrees C (-40°F) in winter, making climbing more challenging and risky than the popular spring season, say hiking officials.
(Click https://tmsnrt.rs/2r5hOS3 for an interactive graphic on last year's deadly spring climbing season.)
The last winter ascent of the mountain dates to 1993, and many winter expeditions since have failed to reach the top, said Mira Acharya, an official of Nepal's tourism department.
Climbers usually spend several weeks on Everest acclimatizing and preparing for summit bids, but compressing that into five days is very challenging and risky, said Shanta Bir Lama, the chief of the Nepal Mountaineering Association.
Last year was Everest's deadliest since 2015, with 11 climbers, most of them Indian, dying, nine on the Nepali side and two on the Tibetan side. 
Since Everest was first summitted by New Zealand beekeeper Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953, about 5,000 people have reached the top, but more than 300 people have died on its slopes.

Two teams from Germany and Spain are now on Everest battling cold weather, hiking officials said.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Hannaa Jassem bends over a patient in a makeshift clinic on the edge of Baghdad's Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ), one of a handful of women in an overwhelmingly male world of demonstrations and political confrontation.
The 24-year-old works as a nurse in a hospital in Iraq's capital during the week, and volunteers at its main protest site at weekends.
As teargas spreads outside, Jassem stitches up wounds in an open-fronted shack supported by metal poles with walls covered in national flags, banners and blue plastic sheeting.
She said her brother initially supported her decision to look after people taking part in the wave of anti-government protests that have raged across Iraq since Oct. 1. ""He was proud that his sister was a medic in Tahrir,"" she told Reuters.
""But later he became apprehensive as things got more dangerous."" Almost 500 people have died in the violence.
Some politicians and influential clerics have been outraged by the sight of young women out in public during the demonstrations in Baghdad and across the impoverished Shi'ite Muslim south.
But that hasn't stopped Jassem. ""Change is what drove me to be a medic and go to protest sites. We are sick of the current situation in terms of rights or being safe or having any security in this country.""
Since her father passed away in 2016, she and her eight brothers and sisters have had to contribute to the family income. On top of her nursing job, she also works part time as a portrait photographer.

That still leaves here the weekends for the protest clinic. ""I always say that if I had enough time I would go to Tahrir every day but my responsibilities at work and home get in the way.""

500,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 03:19AM ET</span>","South Korea, U.S. defense chiefs to meet amid unresolved dispute on cost-sharing","By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - With South Korea's defense minister due to meet his American counterpart on Monday in Washington, the U.S. military doubled down on calls for Seoul to pay more in defense costs, warning of the implications if a deal was not made soon.
Defence Minister Kyeong-doo Jeong and U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper are expected to discuss a standoff with North Korea, as well as plans to give South Korea control of the troops on the peninsula in the event of a war.
But overshadowing both those issues are negotiations over how much South Korea should pay toward maintaining the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops stations there.
The last ""special measures agreement"" (SMA) lapsed at the end of December after multiple rounds of talks yielded no progress, and now the U.S. military says funding will soon run out for thousands of South Korean civilians who work to support the bases.
Without such a pact, United States Forces Korea (USFK) must prepare to put around 8,700 South Korean employees on unpaid leave when money runs out on March 31, leading to some services on the bases being ""degraded, suspended or cancelled,"" the command said in a statement on Monday.
""The potential furlough will have a significant impact - both emotionally and financially - to our Korean National employees,"" USFK commander Gen. Robert Abrams added. ""It will also have some negative repercussions to installation services.""
On Sunday, the Pentagon said it would continue to pay for any South Koreans who ""provide life, health, safety and readiness services"".
But the furloughs may be avoided altogether if South Korea agrees to a ""more equitable"" SMA, the Pentagon added.
A spokesman for South Korea's Defence Ministry declined to comment on the talks, but said the South was stepping up efforts to reach a deal as early as possible to minimize any problems.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said South Korea should bear more of the burden for hosting the troops, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War which ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.
Washington demanded up to $5 billion a year, more than five times what Seoul agreed to pay last year under a one-year deal, though U.S officials said they have ""compromised"" on the numbers.
The salaries of the employees who provide administrative, technical and other services for the U.S. military have typically been covered by about 70 percent of South Korea's contribution.
""We are in unchartered waters,"" Abrams said. ""And we have to prepare for a potential furlough for some of our Korean National employees, and finalize our planning for its impacts now."""
501,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 02:19AM ET</span>",Coroner refers fatal Australian theme park accident to prosecutor,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian theme park on Monday was referred to an industrial prosecutor by the coroner looking into an accident on a river rapids ride that killed four people, saying the operator ignored warnings and failed to do adequate safety checks.
Two men and two women, including a brother and sister, died almost instantly when two rafts collided then flipped onto the mechanical ramp of the Thunder River Rapids Ride at Dreamworld on the Gold Coast, one of Australia's main tourist districts, in 2016.
The coroner's finding that the theme park was ultimately responsible and the referral to a prosecutor raises the prospect it will be charged with breaching workplace laws. The relatives of the dead have long accused the company of wrongdoing.
Shares of the Dreamworld owner Ardent Leisure Group Ltd fell 16% after a long inquest report was published on Monday, adding to hefty falls already besetting tourism stocks due to fears of a global spread of China's coronavirus outbreak.
""There is evidence Dreamworld never conducted a proper risk assessment of the Thunder River Rapid ride in its 30 years of operation,"" wrote Queensland state coroner James McDougall in his report.
Dreamworld knew of risks because of previous incidents on the same ride but ""failed to take any steps to rectify it"" and never undertook a full engineering risk assessment of the ride, which was ""particularly troubling having regard to the previous incidents already documented"".
While the Queensland Office of Industrial Relations had previously investigated the incident, McDougall wrote that it was ""reasonably suspected that Ardent Leisure may have committed an offence under workplace law"" and the prosecutor could use the inquest findings to consider prosecution.
Ardent, the Dreamworld owner, said in a statement the company would build a memorial garden in the theme park and that it was committed to working with the workplace safety authorities to bring about new safety measures, as recommended by the coroner.
""Safety is the team's number one priority and they are proactively focused on continuous improvements to safety across the park in the areas of ride safety and reliability, training of ride operators, emergency management procedures, safety management systems and safety governance,"" the statement said.
The company did not specifically comment on the referral to the prosecutor.
Ardent has already paid some A$5 million ($3.3 million) in over 20 compensation lawsuits by people affected by the 2016 incident, according to local media."

AHMEDABAD, India (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump landed in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad on Monday at the start of a visit during which the two sides will aim to reset relations that have been buffeted by a trade spat. 
India and the United States have built close political and security ties and Trump's two-day trip is a sign of their converging interests, officials say, including a way to counter China's rise as a superpower.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was at the airport to greet Trump and his wife, Melania, as they stepped off Air Force One.
A road show is planned and a huge reception will be held in a 110,000-seat cricket stadium in the city which is the political home of Modi. A huge crowd has filled the stadium, claimed to be the world's biggest cricket ground. 
In the stadium, many people were wearing customized white hats saying ""Namaste (Greetings) Trump"", while workers handed out thousands of cardboard masks of the U.S. president.
""We are ready to come to India, we are on our way, we will be meeting everyone in a few hours,"" Trump tweeted in the Hindi language before he landed.
Modi tweeted in response: ""The guest is God"".
Modi, who has built a personal rapport with Trump, is pulling out the stops for Trump's visit even though a trade deal that Washington was pushing for has run into problems.
The rally in Ahmedabad will be a larger version of the ""Howdy Modi"" rally that Trump and Modi jointly appeared at in Houston to a jubilant crowd of 50,000 Indian Americans last year, where Trump likened Modi to Elvis Presley for his crowd-pulling power.
His entourage includes daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner besides members of his cabinet, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
Many roads were blocked off in Ahmedabad, shops shut and police stationed on rooftops and balconies. School children boarded buses bound for the stadium shouting ""We love Trump."" Others were carrying Indian flags.
""I have been here since 7 a.m. I don't know how many I have handed out,"" said Durvin Prajapati, a 19-year-old volunteer who was standing on the stadium concourse with a box of two thousand Trump masks. ""We like Trump: he is good for business""
ADMIRES MODI'S ABILITY
Trump, who seeks re-election in November, routinely gets the biggest audience of any candidate in the U.S. presidential race, ranging up to 20,000 or so, and he has been grudgingly admiring of Modi’s ability to get a bigger crowd than him.
From Ahmedabad, he heads to Agra for a sunset visit to the iconic Taj Mahal mausoleum, before landing in New Delhi for a summit with Indian officials and business leaders. 
But the prospects of resolving a wrangle over trade that led to both countries imposing retaliatory tariffs remains elusive. Indian and U.S. officials have both said progress is unlikely to be made until after the U.S. election. 
The two sides have been arguing over U.S. demands for access to India's poultry and dairy markets, Indian price controls on medical devices such as stents and stringent local data storage rules that U.S. technology firms say will raise the cost of doing business.
Modi's government has sought restoration of trade concessions that Trump withdrew in 2019 and greater access to U.S. markets for its pharmaceutical and farm products.

The two countries are expected to announce defense deals including an Indian navy plan to buy helicopters from  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) worth $2.6 billion.

Israeli fighter jets launched air strikes on suspected Islamic Jihad positions in Syria just before midnight on Sunday after the militant group and Israeli forces clashed around Gaza earlier in the day.
The strikes in the Adeliyah region outside Damascus targeted what the Israeli military called ""a hub of Islamic Jihad's activity in Syria"", including the research and development of weapons.
Islamic Jihad later said in a statement two of its members were killed in the strike.
The Syrian state news agency SANA quoted a military source as saying Israeli aircraft entered Syrian airspace and targeted areas around Damascus with a wave of guided missiles.

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will be accorded the biggest public reception given to any foreign leader in years during his visit to India beginning on Monday, officials say, one that could help paper over the two countries' growing friction over trade.
Close political and security partners, India and the United States have hit each other with retaliatory tariffs. Over the past month they have engaged in intense negotiations to produce a mini-trade deal, but officials in both countries say it remains elusive.
The two sides have been arguing over U.S. demands for access to India's huge poultry and dairy markets, Indian price controls on medical devices such as stents and stringent local data storage rules that U.S. technology firms say will raise the costs of doing business. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has sought restoration of trade concessions that Trump withdrew in 2019 and greater access to U.S. markets for its pharmaceutical and farm products. Above all, it says that Trump should not treat India on par with China, whose economy is five times larger.
Trump has been saying in recent days that he may be saving the ""big deal"" on trade until after the U.S. presidential election in November.
Senior Trump administration officials acknowledged on Friday that the two-day visit would not result in a limited trade deal, saying that Washington still had too many concerns about India's increasing trade barriers. 
""We want to address a lot of concerns and we're not quite there yet,"" a senior Trump administration official told reporters.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has been leading trade talks with India, will not be part of Trump's delegation, which will include the president's daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. 
STADIUM RALLY
Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to gather in Modi's political hometown of Ahmedabad to greet Trump for a road show leading to a rally in a cricket stadium with a capacity of over 100,000.
On stage, both leaders will address a bigger version of the ""Howdy Modi"" rally that they jointly appeared at in Houston to a jubilant crowd of 50,000 Indian Americans last year, where Trump likened Modi to Elvis Presley for his crowd-pulling power. 
""From the moment of their arrival at the airport a little before noon on 24th February, the delegates will be treated to a display of famed Indian hospitality and India’s Unity in Diversity,"" said Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla.
He said there will be tens of thousands of ordinary citizens as well as artists showcasing the performing arts from different states of the country as part of the India Road Show. 
Trump, who will be accompanied by his wife, Melania, on the trip, has been fascinated with the idea of going to India since his visit to Houston, aides said.
Trump prides himself in having large crowds at his campaign rallies, ranging generally from 10,000 to 20,000 people, and has expressed admiration privately at the size of the crowd awaiting him in India, they said.
FADING TRADE HOPES 
Hopes among U.S. business groups that Trump and Modi could announce some specific trade measures had faded in recent days as differences over new tariffs, agriculture and digital trade continued.
""If we see a deal, it's going to be minimal and even that doesn't seem to be on the table,"" said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank in Washington.
He added that U.S. officials are pushing back against Modi's ""India first"" trade protectionism that, ironically, emulates Trump's tariff policies.
Trade experts said it was possible that India could present Trump with some symbolic trade gestures, such as further reducing high import tariffs on large-engine Harley-Davidson motorcycles, a particular irritant for Trump.
COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS
The two countries are also expected to announce India's purchase of 24 Seahawk naval helicopters from  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) in a deal estimated to be worth $2.6 billion as well as a follow-on order for six Apache (NYSE:APA) attack helicopters.
The United States has become one of India's top arms suppliers, with $18 billion worth of sales over the last 15 years, edging out traditional supplier Russia. 
Trump and Modi are expected to discuss a wide range of issues including trade, 5G telecommunications, counterterrorism, energy security, religious freedom, the rule of law and the importance of the Indo-Pacific region, a senior Trump administration official said.

U.S. energy company Westinghouse is also expected to sign a new agreement with state-run Nuclear Power Corporation of India for the supply of six nuclear reactors, kickstarting a long-running project.

LONDON (Reuters) - British venue owners will have to come up with plans to try to prevent militant attacks and deal with them better if they do happen, the government said on Monday, responding to a series of incidents in recent years.
The interior ministry said it wanted to introduce a law creating a duty on owners and operators of venues and public spaces to consider the risk of an attack and their preparedness for such an event.
This could include increased physical security, training, incident response plans, and exercises for staff on what to do during an attack, the ministry said in a statement.
Security minister James Brokenshire said such venues needed to have ""effective and proportionate protective security and preparedness measures to keep people safe"".
He cited a 2017 bomb that killed 22 after a performance by pop star Ariana Grande in Manchester and recent knife attacks in London as reminders of the security threats facing the country.
The proposed law will be put to a public consultation later in the year, and will invite submissions from businesses and the public sector on how the new duty should be enforced.
""It is important that this new law is proportionate,"" security minister James Brokenshire said in a statement.
""This public consultation will ensure we put in place a law that will help protect the public while not putting undue pressure on businesses,"" he added."

JERUSALEM/GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli fighter jets launched air strikes on suspected Islamic Jihad positions in Syria, the Israeli military said on Monday, after the militant group and Israel exchanged rockets and air strikes around Gaza.
An Israeli military statement said its forces had ""struck Islamic Jihad terror targets south of Damascus"" in addition to ""dozens"" of Islamic Jihad targets throughout the Gaza Strip. 
The air strike in the Adeliyah region outside Damascus targeted what the Israeli military called ""a hub of Islamic Jihad's activity in Syria,"" including the research and development of weapons.
The Israeli announcement came shortly after Syrian state media said its air defenses had intercepted ""hostile targets"" over the Syrian capital, Damascus.
The strike escalated the latest round of hostilities, which began around dawn on Sunday, when, Israel said, its troops killed an Islamic Jihad member who was trying to plant explosives near Israel's border fence with the Gaza Strip.
Video footage shot by a Gaza photographer and widely posted on social media showed what appeared to be the lifeless body of an Islamic Jihad militant dangling from an Israeli military bulldozer as it removed the corpse.
Palestinian health officials and other onlookers said two other Palestinians were wounded by Israeli gunfire directed at a group of people who had approached the area and tried to recover the body.
The images caused an uproar in Gaza, with many social media commentators calling for retaliation.
Islamic Jihad fired a barrage of rockets from Gaza into Israel, setting off air-raid sirens in communities such as Ashkelon. Israel hit back with a series of air strikes in Gaza.
The rockets sent residents of southern Israel running for shelters. Some of the rocket fire was intercepted by Israeli aerial missile defenses, and there were no reports of any Israelis injured.
The Israeli military said that among the ""dozens"" of targets struck in Gaza were underground infrastructure and compounds in Rafah that had been used to store raw material used for manufacturing rockets. 
Shortly before midnight on Sunday, the Syrian state news agency SANA quoted a military source saying that Israeli planes had entered Syrian airspace and targeted areas around Damascus with a wave of guided missiles.
Syrian state-run al-Ikhbariya TV aired footage of what it said were explosions set off in the Damascus night sky by the air defenses system shooting down missiles.
The Syrian military source said most missiles were destroyed before reaching their targets and that the aftermath of the strike was being examined.
Israel says it has carried out hundreds of strikes against targets in Syria in recent years.

In November, Islamic Jihad said Israel had targeted the house of one of its officials in Damascus, killing one of his sons.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - ""Mad Mike"" Hughes, a self-styled explorer and daredevil bent on proving that the earth is flat was killed over the weekend when his homemade rocket crashed in the California desert over the weekend.
""Michael 'Mad Mike' Hughes tragically passed away today during an attempt to launch his homemade rocket,"" the Science Channel, which was planning to feature him on an upcoming series called ""Homemade Astronauts,"" said on Twitter.
""Our thoughts & prayers go out to his family & friends during this difficult time. It was always his dream to do this launch & Science Channel was there to chronicle his journey,"" the network said.
A videotape of the incident, in which the rocket appears to fail shortly after take-off in the Mojave Desert outside Barstow, California, was posted to Twitter by Justin Chapman, a freelance journalist who was filming the launch.
""Mad Mike Hughes just launched himself in a self-made steam-powered rocket and crash landed. Very likely did not survive,"" Chapman wrote in a caption to the video. Barstow is about 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
Chapman told the Los Angeles Times in an interview that Hughes, 64, might have been knocked unconscious during take-off.
""The parachute ripped off at launch,"" Chapman told the paper. ""So the rocket went straight up in an arc and came straight down.""
The video appears to show the launcher attached to the back of a truck. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office told the Times that it would conduct an investigation into the incident.
Hughes gained fame in 2002 when he jumped a Lincoln Town Car stretch limousine 103 feet at a speedway in Perris, California, a stunt certified by Guinness World Records as ""longest limousine ramp jump.""
The silver-haired daredevil later took to trying to prove that the earth was flat and building rockets in a quest to launch himself past the Karman line, the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer space."

SEOUL/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - International concern about the spread of coronavirus outside China grew on Sunday with sharp rises in infections in South Korea, Italy and Iran.
The government in Seoul put the country on high alert after the number of infections surged over 600 with six deaths. A focal point was a church in the southeastern city of Daegu, where a 61-year-old member of the congregation with no recent record of overseas travel tested positive for the virus.
In Italy, officials said a third person infected with the flu-like virus had died, while the number of cases jumped to above 150 from just three before Friday.
Authorities sealed off the worst affected towns and banned public gatherings in much of the north, including halting the carnival in Venice, where there were two cases, to try to contain the biggest outbreak in Europe.
""I was surprised by this explosion of cases,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told state broadcaster RAI, warning that the numbers would likely rise in the coming days. ""We will do everything we can to contain the contagion.""
Italian health authorities were struggling to find out how the virus started. ""If we cannot find 'patient zero' then it means the virus is even more ubiquitous than we thought,"" said Luca Zaia, the regional governor of the wealthy Veneto region.
Almost a dozen towns in Lombardy and Veneto with a combined population of some 50,000 have effectively been placed under quarantine.
The European Union said it had confidence in the Italian authorities. ""We share concern for possible contagion (but) there is no need to panic,"" the bloc's Economic Affairs Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told reporters.
Iran, which announced its first two cases on Wednesday, said it had confirmed 43 cases and eight deaths, with most of the infections in the Shi'ite Muslim holy city of Qom. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey and Afghanistan imposed travel and immigration restrictions on the Islamic Republic.
The virus has killed 2,442 people in China, which has reported 76,936 cases, and has slammed the brakes on the world's second largest economy. It has spread to some 28 other countries and territories, with a death toll of around two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.
""Despite the continuing decline in reported cases from China, the last two days have seen extremely concerning developments elsewhere in the world,"" said Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at Britain's University of East Anglia.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday it was worried by the detection of infections without a clear link to China.

'SEVERE AND COMPLEX'
China, which has seen the vast majority of cases, reported 648 new infections. But only 18 were outside of Hubei province, the lowest number outside the epicenter since authorities began publishing data a month ago and locked down large parts of the country.
""At present, the epidemic situation is still severe and complex, and prevention and control work is in the most difficult and critical stage,"" President Xi Jinping said.
State run television urged people to avoid complacency, drawing attention to people gathering in public areas and tourist spots without wearing masks.
In South Korea, Catholic churches in Daegu and Gwangju have suspended services and other gatherings, while churches elsewhere saw declines in attendance on Sunday, especially among the elderly.
""If the situation gets worse, I think we'll need to take more measures,"" said Song Gi-young, 53, wearing a face mask at church.
South Korea's president said raising the disease alert to the highest level, allowing authorities to send extra resources to Daegu city and Cheongdo county, which were designated ""special care zones"" on Friday.
Health officials reported 169 new infections, bringing the total to 602.
ECONOMIC IMPACT
The potential economic impact of the disease was prominent at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Riyadh.
The International Monetary Fund's chief said China's 2020 growth would likely be lower at 5.6%, down 0.4 percentage points from its January outlook, with 0.1 percentage points shaved from global growth.
Xi highlighted the importance of fighting the epidemic in the capital Beijing, which has recently required people arriving from elsewhere in China to be quarantined at home for 14 days.
He said it would have a relatively big, but short-term impact on the economy and that Beijing would step up policy adjustments to help cushion the blow.
In Japan, where the government is facing growing questions about whether it is doing enough to counter the virus, authorities had confirmed 773 cases by early Sunday evening.
Most of them were from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo, the Diamond Princess. A third passenger, a Japanese man in his 80s, died on Sunday.
British authorities said four people evacuated from the ship had tested positive for the virus after being flown to Britain."

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Shots and tear gas were fired near the presidential palace in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince on Sunday during a protest organized by police demanding better pay and conditions, two Reuters witnesses said. 
It was not immediately clear who fired the shots or the gas during the protest that clashed with the celebrations for Carnival (NYSE:CCL). A stage built by the Ministry of Defense and guarded by the army was also set on fire, a Reuters witness said.
The protest is one of several police have organized since the end of last year and takes place as the impoverished Caribbean island nation struggles with a prolonged economic and political crisis. 
Some protesters wore cream and blue police uniforms and carried guns, but had their faces covered, when they marched from the upscale Delmas neighborhood toward the large Champ de Mars public square, the main site for Carnival.
There, a marching band was playing while spectators and performers were getting ready for a much-anticipated colorful celebration. Police timed the protest for the first day of Carnival to criticize the government's spending priorities.
Haiti's President Jovenel Moise has been ruling by decree since January, after the mandates of lower house deputies and most senators formally expired without successors in October after the country failed to hold elections.
The political situation has cut Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, off from some international funding. This has further hindered its ability to respond to the worsening economic crisis, including food shortages.

The IMF began meetings with Lebanese authorities on Feb. 20 to provide broad technical advice on how to tackle the country's crippling financial and economic crisis. The fund had said its team would stay until Feb. 23.
Lebanon has not requested financial assistance from the IMF as it draws up a rescue plan to tackle a long-brewing financial crisis that spiraled last year as capital inflows slowed and protests erupted against the ruling elite.
The sources familiar with the meetings said talks would continue until the Lebanese government made a decision on issues related to the technical assistance. The results of the meetings were ""positive"", they added, without specifying further.
Lebanon is grappling with an acute liquidity crunch that has prompted banks fearing capital flight to impose strict controls. The Lebanese pound has slumped by about 60% on a parallel market, hiking inflation.
Saddled with one of the highest public debt burdens in the world, Beirut must decide quickly what to do about fast-approaching debt payments including a $1.2 billion Eurobond maturing on March 9.

517,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>","Despite attacks, Sanders' Medicare for All boosts early-state triumphs","By Joseph Ax
(Reuters) - In the days leading up to Saturday's Democratic presidential caucuses in Nevada, Bernie Sanders withstood one attack after another over his Medicare for All plan – both from his rivals and the state's powerful hotel and casino workers' union.
But entrance polls from Edison Research showed more than 60% of caucus-goers favored replacing private insurance with a government-run plan, suggesting Sanders' sweeping proposal helped deliver his decisive win in Nevada rather than damaging his bid.
Those figures were similar to what polls found in the first two contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, where around 60% of voters also backed Medicare for All and Sanders had strong showings. Among Nevadans who supported a single-payer plan, 49% said they were backing Sanders – more than three times that of any other candidate.
If that dynamic holds in South Carolina, which votes on Saturday, and on March 3, when 14 states host elections on ""Super Tuesday,"" Sanders could open up an commanding lead despite moderates' efforts to derail him.
The question for Sanders, and the Democratic Party, is whether Medicare for All could become a liability in November's general election against Republican President Donald Trump, when the Democratic nominee and hundreds of down-ballot candidates may need the support of swing voters and disaffected Trump supporters.
""I don't see most Democrats staying home or defecting because of Medicare for All as an issue,"" said Joel Payne, a veteran of Democratic presidential campaigns. ""What I do see is Democrats being concerned that it is an alienating issue for independents and 'sometimes Trumpers.'""
There are signs the issue could be a tougher sell in the general election.
Polling data released on Friday from the Kaiser Family Foundation found Medicare for All draws support from a slight majority of Americans. But two-thirds of the public back a public option, which would allow individuals to buy into a government plan but would not require it.
The latter proposal is similar to those put forth by Sanders' main moderate rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has coined the phrase ""Medicare for all who want it"" to describe his plan.
At a debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday, both Buttigieg and Biden castigated Sanders for failing to explain how he would finance Medicare for All, which could cost more than $35 trillion over 10 years, according to some estimates.
On Saturday night, Buttigieg told supporters his healthcare plan offered more freedom.
""Senator Sanders believes in taking away that choice, removing people from having the option of a private plan and replacing it with a public plan whether you want it or not,"" Buttigieg said.
Speaking after his resounding victory in Nevada was confirmed, Sanders remained resolute.
""Together we are going to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America, our great country, being the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people,"" he told a crowd in Texas.
SKEPTICISM IN BATTLEGROUND STATES
Some Democrats have said a Sanders nomination risks ceding the party's electoral advantage on healthcare.
In 2018, when Democrats recaptured control of the U.S. House of Representatives, many candidates focused on Republican efforts to repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
The Kaiser foundation's polling has found skepticism about Medicare for All among swing voters, particularly in the key battleground states of Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
""That means it could be a much different story in the general election,"" Kaiser chief executive Drew Altman said on Sunday.
Analysts said Democrats could still win the healthcare argument if they emphasize Republicans' failure to propose an alternative. Within the Democratic Party, the distinctions between plans may not matter as much as the common goal.
""While individual Democratic candidates disagree with one another on the speed with which to achieve universal healthcare coverage, I don't think there's that much disagreement that that is a goal of the Democratic Party,"" said Kyle Kondik, an elections analyst at the University of Virginia.
Sanders has argued his agenda will inspire record-level turnout among people who typically do not participate, lessening the need to appeal to centrist voters.
His dominating victory on Saturday saw him win among voters with and without college degrees, union and nonunion households, and among liberal and moderate or conservative Democrats.
The 35% of voters who said they oppose Medicare for All supported Biden, Buttigieg and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, with Sanders pulling only 8% of those Nevadans.
The powerful Culinary Workers Union had attacked Sanders' Medicare for All plan, warning it would replace the union's popular and hard-fought health benefits.
But rank-and-file members appeared to go against the wishes of their leadership and largely backed Sanders anyway, according to entrance polling and interviews.
Outside a caucus at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino, housekeeper Guadeloupe Niswonger, 54, said she liked Sanders' Medicare for All plan better than her current coverage.
Another housekeeper, Aleiza Smith, 22, said Sanders' liberal policy proposals appealed to her - prompting her to go against the wishes of Culinary Workers Union leadership.

""I'm not big into politics, but I like the things he's going for: student loan debt, schools, free healthcare,"" Smith said.

AALST, Belgium (Reuters) - A satirical Belgian carnival parade decried by Israel's foreign minister as ""hateful"" went ahead on Sunday despite being withdrawn from the United Nation's list of recognized cultural events over accusations of racism and anti-Semitism.
After a float in 2019 featured caricatures of ultra-Orthodox Jews standing with bags of money, organizers in the city of Aalst faced calls to cancel the centuries-old parade, which was included on UNESCO's cultural heritage list in 2010.
Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on Twitter on Thursday: ""Belgium as a Western democracy should be ashamed to allow such a vitriolic anti-Semitic display,"" calling on authorities to ban ""this hateful parade"".
Organizers and participants said the Aalst carnival, which pokes fun at religious, ethnic and social groups, including the British and Belgian royal families, was not against Jews.
""Nobody is targeted,"" said 21-year-old student Jielke, one of thousands of revelers who turned out despite a winter storm.
""Last year there was a lot of fuss, but we want to make fun of everyone,"" she said, standing in front of a float with an effigy of an Arab man as a snake charmer.
UNESCO noted the carnival's ""slightly subversive atmosphere"" when including it in its list of ""Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity"" in 2010, according to its website. It removed it in December 2019, after a request by Belgium and the city of Aalst, which had expected to be taken off the list.
Of some 60 floats, a handful made fun of religion, including one effigy of an ultra-Orthodox Jew with boxes of diamonds. Another was as a mock-up of the Western Wall, the Jewish place of prayer and pilgrimage, in Jerusalem.
A Reuters witness saw one group of men wearing the so-called rabbi kit of oversized noses, side locks and black hats.
The 75th anniversary of the liberation of the death camp Auschwitz and a resurgence of anti-Semitism worldwide have heightened sensitivities outside Belgium to the event.
""You can have fun with everybody, but there's a limit,"" said Philippe Markiewicz, president of the Israelite Consistory of Belgium, the official representative of Jews in the country.
Organizers said there was no suggestion of making fun of the Holocaust. ""My city is neither racist, nor anti-Semitic,"" Aalst Mayor Christophe D'Haese told a news conference.
Nine months in preparation, the celebration is a procession of effigies of giants and includes a broom dance in the central market to chase away the ghosts of winter, as well as a parade of young men dressed as women with corsets and prams.
Some of the carnival's mockery was turned on itself. In two floats, effigies of local politicians held toilet rolls with the words ""UNESCO"" and ""censorship"" written on them."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Sunday accused Representative Adam Schiff of leaking classified information on Russian interference in the 2020 U.S. election to hurt Democratic presidential front-runner Bernie Sanders.
Speaking to reporters as he left the White House for a trip to India, Trump said he had not been briefed on intelligence that Russia was aiming to boost the campaign of Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, and he called for a probe into Schiff for the leak. Schiff, a Democrat, denied the allegation.
A congressional source told Reuters on Friday that intelligence officials had told lawmakers Russia appears to be engaging in disinformation and propaganda campaigns to help both Sanders and Trump, who is seeking re-election.
""I read where Russia is helping Bernie Sanders. Nobody said it to me at all. Nobody briefed me about that at all,"" Trump said.
""They leaked it, Adam Schiff and his group. They leaked it to the papers and - as usual - they ought to investigate Adam Schiff for leaking that information,"" Trump said, without providing any evidence to back up his claims.
Schiff, who served as the lead prosecutor in Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate, said Trump was seeking to turn attention away from his own actions with the comments.
""Nice deflection, Mr. President. But your false claims fool no one,"" he wrote in a tweet. ""You welcomed Russian help in 2016, tried to coerce Ukraine’s help in 2019, and won’t protect our elections in 2020. Now you fired your intel chief for briefing Congress about it. You’ve betrayed America. Again.""
Trump changed out his acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire and replaced him with U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell last week, reportedly after being annoyed by the briefing to lawmakers about Russian interference. 
The president has repeatedly cast doubt on U.S. intelligence findings that Russia intervened to help him in the 2016 presidential election against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state.
By raising questions about the latest findings, Trump appears to be seeking to boost Sanders, who is now the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. As a self-described democratic socialist, Sanders is a candidate Trump would like to take on in a general election to bolster his argument that Democrats are pushing a socialist agenda.
Trump has long argued that the Democratic Party favored Clinton unfairly over Sanders in the 2016 primary race, an issue that still divides the Democratic base.
""I think what it could be is, you know, the Democrats are treating Bernie Sanders very unfairly and it sounds to me like a leak from Adam Schiff because they don't want Bernie Sanders to represent them. It sounds like it's (2016) all over again for Bernie Sanders,"" Trump said.
Other administration officials have cast doubt on reports that Russia was trying to help Trump again this year.

""I haven't seen any intelligence that Russia is doing anything to attempt to get President Trump re-elected,"" White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien told ABC's ""This Week.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump departed on Sunday on quick trip to India, where he is to see crowds so large that they will make the much ballyhooed turnout for his campaign rallies pale in comparison.
With a travel time of 17 hours, Trump and his wife, Melania, were headed first to Germany for a refueling stop at Ramstein military base before heading on to Ahmedabad, India, which is Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's hometown.
There, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to gather to greet Trump on Monday for a road show leading to a rally in a cricket stadium with a capacity of over 100,000. 
Trump routinely gets the biggest crowds of any candidate in the U.S. presidential race, ranging up to 20,000 or so, and he has been grudgingly admiring of Modi's ability to get a bigger crowd than him.
""Here's my problem,"" Trump told a large crowd of supporters in an arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado, last week. ""We have a packed house. We have thousands of people who couldn't get in. It's going to look like peanuts from now on.""
It will be a larger version of the ""Howdy Modi"" rally that they jointly appeared at in Houston to a jubilant crowd of 50,000 Indian Americans last year, where Trump likened Modi to Elvis Presley for his crowd-pulling power.
After addressing the stadium crowd, Trump and his entourage will travel to Agra for a picturesque to visit the Taj Mahal. Then it will be on to New Delhi, where he and Modi are to have a day of talks and attend an evening banquet on Tuesday. The Trumps get back to Washington on Wednesday.
Consumed with trying to win re-election on Nov. 3, Trump's travel this week will likely be one of his few foreign trips.
After concluding trade deals with China and Canada and Mexico, Trump would like to reach a similar agreement with India to open more markets for American goods, but progress has been slow and Trump in recent days has said such a pact is more likely after the U.S. election.
India and the United States have hit each other with retaliatory tariffs. Over the past month they have engaged in intense negotiations to produce a mini-trade deal, but officials in both countries say it remains elusive. 
The two sides have been arguing over U.S. demands for access to India's huge poultry and dairy markets, Indian price controls on medical devices such as stents and stringent local data storage rules that U.S. technology firms say will raise the costs of doing business. 
Modi's government has sought restoration of trade concessions that Trump withdrew in 2019 and greater access to U.S. markets for its pharmaceutical and farm products.
U.S. officials say Trump will raise the sensitive subject of religious freedom during his meetings.
Modi's government has faced protests at home and criticism abroad for enacting a citizenship law that is seen as discriminating against Muslims.

Khalid al-Mahjoub, a spokesman for Haftar's self-styled Libya National Army (LNA), said the Turks were killed in the port city of Misrata, in battles in Tripoli and in the town of al-Falah south of the capital.
Turkey backs Libya's internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) and has sent Syrian soldiers along with some of its own soldiers and weapons to help the Tripoli-based administration repel an attempt by the LNA to capture the city.
Haftar's forces are backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, and have also had help from Russian mercenaries.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday acknowledged some Turkish losses in Libya's ""struggle"".
""We are there (in Libya) with our (Turkish) soldiers and our teams from the Syrian National Army. We continue the struggle there. We have several martyrs. In return, however, we neutralized nearly a hundred (of Haftar's) legionaries,"" Erdogan said.
The Syrian National Army, also known as Free Syrian Army, is a Turkey-backed Syrian rebel group fighting against pro-Damascus forces in northern Syria, where 16 Turkish soldiers have been killed so far this month.
The deployment of Turkish soldiers and sophisticated air defenses has erased small gains made by the LNA with the help of Russian mercenaries, returning the frontline roughly to where it was at start of Haftar's campaign in April 2019.
Ceasefire talks between Libya's warring sides resumed on Thursday after the GNA had pulled out of negotiations following the shelling of Tripoli's port by Haftar's forces.

Turkey has sent thousands of troops to Idlib in the last few weeks after a stepped up campaign by President Bashar al-Assad to re-take the last rebel stronghold prompted nearly a million Syrians to flee for the Turkish frontier.
So far 16 Turkish soldiers have been killed since reinforcements began entering northern Syria earlier this month, raising the prospect of broader conflict.
The Observatory said a fresh Turkish military convoy of about 65 vehicles entered northern Syria on Sunday and headed to the southern Idlib area of Jabal Zawiya before being pushed back by the shelling and Russian air strikes.
After Russia and Turkey, which support opposite sides in the nine-year war, failed to reach an agreement in the last two weeks over Idlib, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to push back Syrian government forces if they press on.
Turkey already hosts 3.7 million Syrian refugees and says it cannot handle another wave.

TOKYO (Reuters) - One of the stars of ""Parasite"" said on Sunday he hoped the film would help improve cultural ties between Japan and Korea, which have been strained by disputes including a trade row that ignited between the Asian neighbors last year.
Actor Song Kang-ho, who in the Oscar-winning film plays the father of the basement-dwelling Kim family, said he was happy about the warm welcome Japanese fans had given ""Parasite"" and hoped relations would continue to improve.
""I hope we can go back to the early 2000s, and have an interest in each other's works,"" Song told reporters at the Japan National Press Club. ""Japan and Korea are close countries and can relate to each other's cultures.""
""Looking at how 'Parasite' has been received even in Japan, I hope we can have a mutual interest in each other's cultures.""
Song did not directly reference current relations, but the two countries have been going through a rocky patch since last year when a diplomatic row over Japanese compensation for forced World War Two laborers was exacerbated by a trade dispute.
Japanese filmgoers have embraced ""Parasite"" since it opened in the country on Jan. 10. The film rode its Oscar bounce to the top of the Japanese box office last weekend and has now become the top-grossing South Korean film in Japan of all time.
""I've come to Tokyo because I want to express my appreciation for the interest that all the filmgoers have shown,"" the film's director Bong Joon-ho told the same news conference.
""Parasite"", a dark social satire about the disparities between rich and poor in Seoul, made history this month by becoming the first foreign-language film to take Hollywood's top prize.

The film, which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last year, also scooped up three other Academy Awards including best director for Bong, who beat out Hollywood royalty including Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - More than 2,000 Hungarians, including Roma families and civil groups, marched to parliament on Sunday to protest against the government's refusal to pay compensation to Roma children who had been unlawfully segregated in a school in eastern Hungary.
Nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has come under fire from the European Union for his perceived erosion of the rule of law, suggested the state should disobey court orders to pay compensation to Roma children in the village of Gyongyospata and provide training instead.
Lower courts have ordered the state to pay damages in a lawsuit that has been dragging on for almost a decade. Hungary's top court is due to make a final ruling soon.
With the economy slowing, and his anti-immigration campaign losing steam, analysts say Orban is seeking to mobilize his voters by targeting independent courts, the Roma minority, and the NGOs who help them.
""The meddling of the government in the Gyongyospata restitution issue is unlawful and violates the rule of law and the independence of the courts,"" protest organizers said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Protesters held up banners saying ""No one is above the law"" and ""The future cannot be built on hatred"".
Orban has been in power since 2010 and his ruling Fidesz party is leading in opinion polls because of its anti-immigration stance.
However, Fidesz suffered a surprise setback in a municipal election last October, losing Budapest to the opposition.
Orban has said ""a court ruling citing segregation has stirred up public opinion by awarding large sums of money to some Roma residents,"" adding that everyone must work to receive money.
He has also said ""business-savvy lawyers"" exploited overcrowded prison conditions to launch 12,000 lawsuits against the government for breaking EU prison standards. Senior lawyers said Orban was undermining the rule of law.
Fidesz has said people connected with Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros helped Roma launch the lawsuits. The party has campaigned for years against Soros, who promotes liberal causes.
By Sunday, close to 500 psychologists had signed a petition saying that the government campaign could fuel hatred between Roma and non-Roma. Roma make up 5-7% of Hungary's population.
Robert Laszlo, an analyst at liberal think-tank Political Capital, said Orban was trying to energize his base with his new campaign.
This will include a ""national consultation"" next month when questionnaires will be sent to millions of Hungarians on the issues of payments to Roma and compensation for prisoners."
530,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>","Iran announces low poll turnout, blames coronavirus 'propaganda'","By Parisa Hafezi
DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran on Sunday announced a 42% turnout in its parliamentary election, the lowest rate since the 1979 Islamic revolution, while its top leader said Tehran's enemies played up the new coronavirus threat to dissuade people from voting.
With Iran facing growing isolation and threats of conflict over its nuclear standoff with the United States, and increasing discontent at home, the turnout is seen as a referendum on the popularity of the Islamic republic's rulers. 
""The turnout across the country was 42.57% ... In Tehran, it was around 25%. Across Iran, over 24 million people voted,"" Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli told a televised news conference. Turnout was 62% in the 2016 parliamentary vote and 66% of voters cast ballots in 2012.
The final results, announced by the Interior Ministry, showed big gains by hardline loyalists close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last say on all state matters. 
In Tehran, a list of hardliners gained 30 seats for the capital, with former commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, topping the list. 
Qalibaf's pedigree as the Guards' air force commander, a war veteran and a national police chief has endeared him to Iran's supreme leader, bolstering his chances of becoming the next parliament speaker.
Khamenei, who on Friday said that voting was ""a religious duty"", blamed the low turnout on the ""negative propaganda"" about the new coronavirus by Iran's enemies. 
""This negative propaganda about the virus began a couple of months ago and grew larger ahead of the election,"" said Khamenei, according to his official website Khamenei.ir.
""Their media did not miss the tiniest opportunity for dissuading Iranian voters and resorting to the excuse of disease and the virus.""
Iran, which confirmed its first case of the new coronavirus two days before the polls, has announced 43 cases of the virus in four different cities, including Tehran. With eight deaths, Iran has the highest death toll from the new coronavirus outside of China, the homeland of the outbreak. 
The parliament has no major influence on foreign affairs or Iran's nuclear policy, which are determined by Khamenei. But it might bolster hardliners in the 2021 contest for president and toughen Tehran’s foreign policy. 
The United States’ 2018 withdrawal from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, and its reimposition of sanctions, have hit Iran’s economy hard.
The establishment's legitimacy was badly damaged after nationwide protests in November, which were met with a violent crackdown that deepened resentment over economic hardship and corruption. 
The hardline Guardian Council, which must approve candidates, removed thousands of moderates and leading conservatives from the race by barring about 6,850 hopefuls from in favor of hardliners from among 14,000 applicants.
""Our people's participation in Friday's election was good,"" said Khamenei.

PARIS (Reuters) - Former French prime minister Francois Fillon and his wife Penelope go on trial on Monday over a fake jobs scandal that wrecked his 2017 run for president and opened the Elysee Palace door for Emmanuel Macron.
Fillon's bid for the presidency unraveled after allegations he paid his wife hundreds of thousands of euros for doing little, if any, work as his parliamentary assistant.
A consummate political insider who was prime minister under Nicolas Sarkozy's presidency, Fillon was the comfortable frontrunner in the election race when the allegations surfaced. He denied wrongdoing, resisted party pressure to pull his candidacy, and was eliminated in the first round of the vote.
Fillon said in an interview last month that his wife had been his most important employee and that her work for him would be proven at trial.
""She managed my constituency diary and my mail, and edited the speeches I was making,"" he told public broadcaster France 2.
Investigators estimate Penelope Fillon received 1 million euros ($1 million) from her husband's office over a three decade period from the early 1980s to 2013.
When the scandal broke, Fillon denounced what he called a campaign of dirty tricks and denied having done anything illegal, though he admitted an error of judgment. He told France 2 he may have made mistakes.
""I surely committed errors but there is something that I will not accept, and that is that people think that I am dishonest or that I sought to con the French people,"" he said.
Fillon is accused of embezzling public funds, a charge which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a 1 million euro fine. His wife is charged with complicity to embezzlement and concealment of public money.
A lawyer for the couple was not available for comment.
Facing the judges beside the Fillons will be Marc Joulaud, who is accused of continuing to channel funds to Penelope Fillon after he took the conservative politician's parliamentary seat while he was in government. He also denies the changes.
The French parliament, which is a claimant in the case, this week said it was seeking more than 1 million euros in damages from Francois Fillon and Joulaud.
Fillons' defense team will ask the judges on Monday that the trial be postponed by two days in support of a strike by lawyers against Macron's pension reform, France's AFP news agency reported.
Fillon now works for investment management firm Tikehau Capital.

Greece and Turkey are at odds over a host of issues ranging from mineral rights in the Aegean Sea to ethnically split Cyprus. Tensions are also running high because of Turkish drilling off Cyprus and the European Union has prepared sanctions against Turkey in response.
""France intends to stand by Greece and help it to confront multiple tensions in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean,"" Parly told To Vima newspaper in an interview.
She said French President Emmanuel Macron was clear when he met Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in late January that Paris and Athens were set to strengthen their defense cooperation.
A Greek navy frigate is already escorting French aircraft carrier Charles De Gaulle in its operations in the Mediterranean.
""France supports Greece and Cyprus on the issue of respecting their sovereignty in maritime zones and condemns, together with its European partners, Turkey's lack of respect of these fundamental rules,"" Parly told the paper.
Athens has been angered by an accord between Libya and Turkey signed on Nov. 27 that maps out a sea boundary between the two countries close to the Greek island of Crete, calling the accord a blatant violation of international law.
Turkey and the internationally recognized government of Libya signed the accord defining their boundaries and a deal on expanded security and military cooperation, a step Ankara said was protecting its rights. [nL8N2882ZR]
Greece has called the accord absurd because it ignores the presence of Crete between the coasts of Turkey and Libya.

The forces destroyed an unmanned boat laden with explosives that was launched from Hodeidah province in western Yemen, coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said in a statement on Saudi state news agency SPA, without identifying the targets.
There was no immediate confirmation from the Houthi movement, which has been battling the Sunni Muslim military coalition since 2015 in a conflict that is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and foe Shi'ite Iran.
Yemen lies along the Bab al-Mandeb strait at the southern mouth of the Red Sea, one of the most important trade routes for oil tankers heading from the Middle East to Europe.
Malki said the planned attack posed a threat to regional and international security and maritime trade. He said the use of Hodeidah for operations was a ""glaring violation"" of a U.N.-led peace deal in the disputed port city that was agreed between the Saudi-backed Yemeni government and the Houthis in December 2018.
Violence rose in January, ending more than three months of unprecedented calm in the five-year-old conflict following informal ceasefire talks between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis.
Coalition warplanes carried out several air strikes on the Houthi-held capital Sanaa on Sunday, hitting the presidential palace and other military sites, residents told Reuters.
Malki said later that the operation on Sanaa had destroyed Houthi sites used to store ballistic missiles and drones.
The strikes were the first to hit the capital for several months, residents said, and followed attempted missile attacks by Houthi forces on Saudi cities on Friday, as the kingdom prepared for a gathering of finance ministers from the Group of 20 major economies in Riyadh.
The Western-backed coalition intervened in Yemen to try to restore the internationally recognized government that was ousted from power in Sanaa in late 2014 by the Houthis, who now control most major urban centers.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Nine people died and hundreds of buildings collapsed in southeastern Turkey on Sunday after a magnitude-5.7 earthquake struck near the border with Iran, injuring dozens in villages and towns in both countries, government officials said. 
Three of those killed were children and 37 Turks were injured, including nine critically, Turkey's health ministry said. 
The shallow tremor caused more than 1,000 buildings to collapse in Turkey, prompting a brief rescue effort to find those trapped under rubble.
The quake damaged buildings some 90 km (56 miles) to the west in the Turkish city of Van, and to the east in dozens of villages in Iran, where state TV said 75 people were injured including six in hospital, though there were no fatalities. 
Crisscrossed by major fault lines, Iran and Turkey are among the most earthquake-prone countries in the world.
Turkish TV footage showed people digging with shovels and their hands in the rubble, as well as furniture and belongings strewn on cracked and snowy roads. 
In one village the ground cratered under several buildings, while in others residents were wrapped in blankets outside homes with crumbled and cracked exterior walls, fallen metal roofs and twisted wiring. 
""The damage caused loss of life,"" the governor of Van, Mehmet Bilmez, told reporters standing in front of a pile of cinder blocks and sheet metal. ""There is destruction in all four villages"" he visited on Sunday morning, he added. 
The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said the quake, which hit at 8:53 a.m. local time (05:53 GMT), had a depth of 5 km (3.1 miles). 
Broadcasters and government officials said dozens of villages were rattled in Turkey, which like Iran has a history of powerful earthquakes. Nearly 150 tents were sent to shelter families in the region, where several schools in the districts of Baskale, Saray and Gurpinar sustained minor damage. 
Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) has begun rescue work in villages including in Ozpinar, about 25 km south of the epicenter, said Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. AFAD measured the tremor at 5.9 magnitude. 
The U.S. Geological Survey put the epicenter 47 km west of the Iranian city of Khoy, where people felt the tremor, according to state TV. 
An earthquake last month in eastern Turkey killed more than 40 people while another in Iran did structural damage to homes without causing any fatalities.
An Iranian official told state TV that rescue teams had been dispatched to the area in Iran's West Azarbaijan province. 
Another local official said the earthquake was felt in several towns including Urmiah and Salmas, and many villages including some that suffered ""100% damage"", state TV reported.

AHMEDABAD, India (Reuters) - India deployed more than 10,000 police and gave a facelift to the former home of independence hero Mahatma Gandhi on Sunday on the eve of a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump, whose two-day trip aims to repair bilateral relations after a trade spat. 
Trump lands in the western city of Ahmedabad on Monday, where he will address a rally of more than 100,000 in a newly-built cricket stadium, before a visit to Agra's renowned Taj Mahal and a summit with Indian officials and business leaders in New Delhi.
In Ahmedabad, a wall at least six feet high in places will block a slum from Trump's view. 
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made grand visits to his home state of Gujarat a signature of his time in power, with the leaders of Japan and China both taking similar trips to Ahmedabad, the state's largest city. 
But the arrival of Trump, residents and officials say, is unprecedented in scale. 
On Sunday, more than ten thousand police - some mounted on camels - fanned out across the city. At the Sabarmati Ashram, the former home of India's independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, laborers watered lawns and painted walls. 
""A general facelift is being done,"" said Kartikeya Sarabhai, a trustee of the organization. ""(But) the beauty of the Ashram is in its simplicity."" 
The modest complex is a possible 15-minute stop on Monday for Trump, whose New York penthouse is decorated in gold in the style of French king Louis XIV. 
Sarabhai said that should Trump visit, he is likely to be given a charkha, a traditional spinning wheel used by Gandhi, as well as a copy of his autobiography. 
""We are also considering gifting a set of (Gandhi's) Three Monkeys, which stress on not seeing, hearing, or speaking evil,"" Sarabhai added. 
Preparations have not been without problems. 
A 30-foot arch by the VIP entrance to the stadium expected to be used by Trump collapsed on Sunday morning due to high winds, police said, though it was quickly repaired. 
KNIVES OUT
There is enthusiasm among many in India for Trump's arrival, but others have been angered at the cost - nearly $12 million for a three-hour visit, according to officials. 
At the Saraniya Vas slum, authorities have built a wall at least six feet high in places, shielding the settlement from Trump's view. 
Many residents - who receive water for 90 minutes per day at communal taps - earn around 7,500 Indian rupees ($104.36) per month sharpening knives for hotels, and are from the Saraniya community that gives the slum its name. 
""Priority should be given to us - at least the basics should be provided,"" said Sanjay Saraniya, a 27-year-old father of three, yards from the glossy tarmac of a newly-paved road and at least a dozen large billboards featuring Modi, Trump and his wife Melania. 
""I wake up every morning and think about how I am going to earn enough money to feed my children."" 
Half a dozen people said they had been offered 200 Indian rupees ($2.78) each by Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party to attend the roadshow - a claim that Dashrath Saraniya (no relation), a party worker in the slum, denied. 
""He is our guest and we will welcome him - if we can see him,"" Sanjay Saraniya said of the visit.

The Future Forward Party, the third-largest party in parliament, was dissolved on Friday by Thailand's Constitutional Court over a loan it took from its billionaire founder.
The dissolution was decried by democracy advocates as a way to weaken opposition to the government of Prayuth, who first came to power in a 2014 military coup and led a military junta until after elections last year that his pro-army party won.
Future Forward's spokeswoman, Pannika Wanich, told reporters at a news conference on Sunday that the junta had worked with Malaysia's former government to arrest a whistleblower in the 1MDB case in 2015 and had allowed financial criminals to operate in Thailand, risking the country's international ties.
""The junta government yearned for international acceptance after the coup...and formed a dark alliance with Malaysia,"" Pannika said. 
""The only person who can issue these orders is Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha,"" Pannika said. 
Pannika cited irregularities surrounding Thailand's arrest and the subsequent confession of Xavier Justo, the Swiss national who was arrested in Thailand in 2015 the first whistleblower in the 1MDB affair. 
The government also harbored Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, known as Jho Low, allowing him to enter the country at least five times between October 2016 and May 2018, despite Low having an Interpol red notice from Singapore, she said.
Low has been charged in Malaysia and the United States over the alleged theft of $4.5 billion from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), set up by former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak with the help of Low, to promote economic development.
At least six countries, including the United States, have launched money laundering, financial mismanagement and criminal probes into 1MDB dealings.
Low has denied any wrongdoing. His whereabouts are unknown.
Future Forward Party said it would have opened an investigation on corruption and money laundering related to the 1MDB case if it were in power.
""If we were in government, we would investigate. We want a government that is a responsible neighbor and acts with dignity,"" Pannika said.
""Since we have been dissolved, we can't, but the Thai public can demand the truth.""

A spokesman for the Malaysian prime minister's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Pellegrini was due to appear in a televised debate later on Sunday with leaders of all other parties taking part in the European Union member country's Feb. 29 vote.
""Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini was hospitalized yesterday night due to acute upper respiratory tract infection accompanied with high temperature. Due to his condition, he is cancelling his entire schedule temporarily,"" Pellegrini's office said in a statement.

BARI, Italy (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday warned against ""inequitable solutions"" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, saying they would only be a prelude to new crises, in an apparent reference to U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace proposal.
Francis made his comments in the southern Italian port city of Bari, where he traveled to conclude a meeting of bishops from all countries in the Mediterranean basin.
""The Mediterranean region is currently threatened by outbreaks of instability and conflict, both in the Middle East and different countries of North Africa, as well as between various ethnic, religious or confessional groups,"" Francis said.
""Nor can we overlook the still unresolved conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, with the danger of inequitable solutions and, hence, a prelude to new crises,"" he said.
The participants included Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the head of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, whose jurisdiction includes Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan.
It was believed to be the first time the pope, who has often defended both Palestinian rights and Israel's need for security, has spoken in public about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since Trump announced the plan on Jan. 28.
The plan would recognize Israel's authority over West Bank Jewish settlements and require Palestinians meet a series of conditions for a state, with its capital in a West Bank village east of Jerusalem.
Although Trump's stated aim was to end decades of conflict, his plan favored Israel, underlined by the Palestinians' absence from his White House announcement with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his side.
The Palestinians and Arab League foreign ministers have rejected the plan and the Palestinian Authority has cut all ties with the United States and Israel.
Palestinians, with broad international backing, want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state, while Israel views the whole city its ""united and eternal"" capital.
The pope expressed concern in 2018 when the United States announced the moving of its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, saying the city's ""status quo"" should be respected. Francis has called for all to honor U.N. resolutions on the city.
""There is no reasonable alternative to peace, because every attempt at exploitation or supremacy demeans both its author and its target. It shows a myopic grasp of reality, since it can offer no future to either of the two,"" Francis said, speaking in general about the Middle East.
Francis again warned against populist politicians who he said used ""demagogic terms"" such as ""invasion"" when talking of migration.
""To be sure, acceptance and a dignified integration are stages in a process that is not easy. Yet it is unthinkable that we can address the problem by putting up walls,"" he said."

In the first electoral test since Merkel's protegee Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer threw her Christian Democrats (CDU) into turmoil two weeks ago by saying she did not want the top job, polls suggest the SPD will remain the biggest party in Hamburg.
The Greens, however, are expected to see the biggest gains, reflecting their strength on the national level, due mainly to growing fears about climate change.
Voters may punish Merkel's CDU, embroiled in a fierce internal debate about who should take over the party leadership from Kramp-Karrenbauer and run as chancellor in the next federal election, due by Oct. 2021.
Merkel, chancellor of Europe's biggest economy for almost 15 years, has said she will not seek re-election.
The most recent poll for Hamburg, traditionally an SPD stronghold, put the SPD first on 39% with the Greens about 15 points behind and the CDU trailing by another 12 points.
However, the Greens could roughly double their share of the vote, reflecting their national strength. Capitalising on fears about climate change, they are second behind Merkel's conservatives at the national level and tipped to be part of the next government.
Local issues such as transport and housing have dominated the campaign in Hamburg, which with its famous fish market and red-light district has a reputation for being one of Germany's most tolerant cities.
The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which made big gains in state elections in the former Communist East last year, is relatively weak, polling at around 6%.
Results are due at 6 p.m. (1700 GMT)."

Officials in Taskforce Europe, which is run by David Frost, the prime minister's European Union negotiator, are seeking to evade Irish Sea checks on goods passing from Britain to Northern Ireland, according to the newspaper.
The officials believe that Suella Braverman, the new attorney-general, may need to give fresh legal advice to the justify the move, the newspaper said. Sources told the Sunday Times that Braverman was appointed because her predecessor Geoffrey Cox was not willing to take such action.
Johnson's cabinet will meet on Tuesday to sign off on the proposals, which will then be presented in parliament and published online on Thursday, the report added.
France on Wednesday said it was imperative that negotiations over a future trade relationship between Britain and the EU included customs checks in the Irish Sea.
Johnson struck a divorce deal with the EU last October that leaves the United Kingdom's province of Northern Ireland inside the UK customs area but all EU procedures will apply to goods arriving there."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Families, firefighters and politicians gathered in a solemn public ceremony in Sydney on Sunday to honor the 25 people killed in recent bushfires that tore through the country's most populous state.
The bushfires, which lasted from September until torrential rains hit earlier this month, killed 33 people and a billion native animals nationally and destroyed 2,500 homes and a wilderness area the size of South Korea.
The damage was most devastating in New South Wales state. Among the 25 people killed there were 19 civilians, three local volunteer firefighters and three U.S. firefighters.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who thanked those who fought the blazes and honored those who died, spoke of ""children kissing the coffins of their fathers"" and ""mothers who should have never had to bury their children"".
He told the public, gathered around lit candles, of ""a summer where the dark sky turned black and sunsets only signaled another night of terror, where the fire crashed on our beaches from the bush that surrounded them"".
Morrison has drawn public anger for his refusal to directly link the bushfires to climate change, insisting removing flammable vegetation is ""just as important, if not more"".
His management of the fires also came under criticism over the unusually prolonged summer wildfire season, when he was forced into a rare public apology for taking a holiday to Hawaii.
Last week, he said Australia would conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into the causes of the fires.
NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons, who played a very public role during the crisis, said the season will be remembered as one of the most challenging, in which the loss of life was enormous.
""Each one of those is a story of grief, of profound loss, and great sadness, of lives cut short, and of families being changed forever,"" Fitzsimmons said.
Six pairs of boots were placed to symbolize the lives of the three Australian volunteers and the three U.S. firefighters who died in NSW."

The latest development in a long-running saga could sow further discord among the prime minister and his siblings - whose father Lee Kuan Yew co-founded the party which has ruled the island nation unbroken since independence - just as an election looms.
The family feud centers around the fate of the old house of Singapore's first premier and the father of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
""I disagree with the Disciplinary Tribunal's report and will fight this strongly when it is heard in open court,"" said Lee Suet Fern, a lawyer who is married to the prime minister's younger brother. She made the comments in a text message replying to Reuters queries.
The prime minister's brother, Lee Hsien Yang, and sister, Lee Wei Ling, want the house to eventually be demolished in accordance with what they said was their father's wishes as stated in his will.
But the prime minister has questioned whether his father really wanted the home, near Singapore's bustling Orchard Road shopping district, to be knocked down.
The Attorney General's Chambers (AGC) had last year referred to the Law Society a case of ""possible professional misconduct"" over the involvement of Lee Suet Fern in the will as her husband was one of the beneficiaries.
The tribunal in its findings last week, seen by Reuters, said it found that the charges against her have been proven beyond reasonable doubt and there was cause for disciplinary action.
It said that even if she had not been the senior Lee's lawyer, she misled him, and procured his execution of the will on the basis of misrepresentations.
In her defense, her lawyers said Lee Kuan Yew was never her client and she was not instructed by him in relation to the will. She was merely assisting in a family matter at the request of her husband, they added.
Her case will be referred to the Court of Three Judges, the highest disciplinary body to deal with lawyers' misconduct, and she could face a fine, suspension or be disbarred as a lawyer, newspaper Straits Times reported.
Her husband, Lee Hsien Yang, did not comment directly on the ruling, but shared his sister's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Sunday that criticized the decision.
He has previously said his wife ""was never Lee Kuan Yew's lawyer"" and that ""no one has complained from the outset on the process and circumstances"" of his father's signing his final will.
Singapore's general election must be held by early next year."

SANTO DOMINGO (Reuters) - Hundreds of Dominicans took to the streets on Saturday night in fresh protests after the abrupt suspension of municipal elections that unleashed a political crisis months before the Caribbean island votes for a new president.
The protests started after the electoral institute on Feb. 16 suspended a nationwide election four hours after voting began. The authority said about half of the machines used in the most populated municipalities to cast votes electronically had failed.
""We came to take out the garbage,"" read one banner, carried by a group of masked students in front of the electoral institute in Santo Domingo. Across the country, protesters have demanded the resignation of the institute's officials and an investigation.
""I'm tired of them always treating us like we're stupid,"" said Melina Adames, who, like many who took to the streets, was dressed in black to mourn the death of democracy. Others were hitting cauldrons in a traditional form of protest.
Dominicans will vote for a new president on May 17. In an attempt to stem the protests, the government asked the Organization of American States (OAS) earlier this week to help investigate the ruling that led to the suspension.
Flavio Dario Espinal, a government representative, told reporters a local investigation without independent political actors would only generate more suspicion.
The OAS said on Friday that while there was no evidence to suggest the machines had been manipulated, it was committed to finding a solution for the problems.
Even before the municipal election, opposition politicians had challenged the use of automated voting machines, which the government acquired last year for $19 million, arguing that its software could be manipulated."

SOFIA (Reuters) - Fewer than 200 far-right activists gathered in downtown Sofia on Saturday after the country's top court upheld the city mayor's ban on their annual torchlight procession honoring a Bulgarian general who led a pro-Nazi organization in the 1930s and 1940s.
Held every February since 2003, the Lukov March - which attracts right-wing extremists from various parts of Europe and Bulgarian youths - has been repeatedly banned by the Sofia municipality in recent years, but until now the prohibition had been overturned by the Supreme Court.
This year the activists were restricted to the laying of wreaths at the house where pro-Nazi General Hristo Lukov, who served as Bulgaria's minister of war from 1935-1938, was killed.
Lukov was known for fostering close ties with senior Nazi officials in Germany. He pushed through a Bulgarian law modeled on the 1935 Nuremberg Laws in Germany that stripped Jews of their civic rights.
Far-right groups from Germany, Sweden, Hungary, Estonia and other countries have joined the Lukov March in previous years.
On Friday, police in the German city of Dortmund stopped nine far-right activists from boarding a flight to Sofia, where they had intended to take part in the annual parade. The passports of the nine were temporarily confiscated, police said in a statement.
A few hundred people gathered at a counter-protest under the motto ""No Nazis on the streets"" in central Sofia a few hours before the procession.
The Lukov March has prompted concern in local media about the rise of the far-right in the Balkan state.
Bulgaria's government, most of its political parties and several Jewish organizations, including the World Jewish Congress, had called for the march to be suspended.
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ekaterina Zaharieva said that the ideologies of behind the Lukov March and a shooting in the German town of Hanau, where nine people were killed on Wednesday, were little different.
""I also make a connection with the Lukov March, which unfortunately takes place in Bulgaria,"" Zaharieva said.
""I call on the young people not to blindly believe in ideologies that are against humanity, because that is not much different from what happened in Hanau. There was nothing democratic and legal about neo-Nazi chants.""
Bulgaria fought in World War Two on Germany's side, though the government of King Boris III refused Adolf Hitler's demand to deport the country's Jews to death camps in Nazi-occupied Poland and elsewhere."

In a letter sent on Saturday to the L'Arche Federation, the leaders of the organization made public the conclusions of the investigation which they had commissioned from an external and independent UK-based body GCPS.
Vanier, who founded l'Arche in 1964, died last year aged 90.
The GCPS investigation included testimonies implicating Vanier and highlighted his historic links to Father Thomas Philippe, a priest whom he considered to be his spiritual father, the letter said.
From 2014, L'Arche officials received several testimonies from women alleging that they had been sexually abused by Philippe, prompting the latest investigation.
The probe also uncovered acts of abuse committed by Vanier. ""Sincere and consistent testimonies spanning from 1970-2005 were received from six adult women without disabilities indicating that Jean Vanier initiated sexual relations with them, generally as part of spiritual accompaniment. Some of these women have suffered deep wounds,"" L'Arche said, without specifying the nature of the harm suffered.
The current leaders of L'Arche International, Stephan Posner and Stacy Cates Carney, wrote in a letter to the L'Arche Federation published on Saturday, that they were shocked by the discoveries and unreservedly condemned the actions of Vanier and Philippe."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish soldier was killed in Syria's Idlib region in a bomb attack by Russian-backed government forces, the defence ministry said on Saturday, Turkey's 16th military death during a month in which talks between Ankara and Moscow have stalled. 
The rising Turkish military death toll, including two on Thursday, could complicate a possible deal to halt a spike in fighting in Syria's northwest. Since early December nearly a million Syrians, mostly women and children, have been displaced in the winter cold there. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he will meet Russian, German and French counterparts on March 5 to discuss Idlib, where Syrian government forces are pushing to retake the last large rebel-held region after nine years of war in the country. 
Turkey has sent thousands of troops and equipment to the region just south of its border to head off the campaign driven by Russian air raids. It already hosts 3.7 million Syrian refugees, says it cannot handle another wave and has closed its borders.
Turkish forces retaliated to the bomb attack Saturday and destroyed 21 ""regime targets"", the ministry said, adding the soldier was a tank mechanic who died when transferred to hospital.
After Russian and Turkish delegations failed to reach an agreement in the last two weeks, Erdogan has promised to push back Syrian government forces if they press on.
Turkey has ""determined our road map"" for Syria after calls on Friday with Vladimir Putin, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, Erdogan told supporters in Izmir on Saturday. ""I expressed our determination clearly"" to them, he said.
The German and French leaders expressed concern about the humanitarian situation in Idlib and urged an end to the conflict, while the Kremlin has said it is discussing the possibility of holding a four-way summit. 
In Damascus, the transport ministry declared the main highway from Aleppo running through Idlib open to the public after it was recaptured in the offensive. 
Taking back the M5 highway from insurgents marks a big gain for President Bashar al-Assad, as it restores state control over the route between Syria's two biggest cities for the first time in years of conflict.
Syrian state media, citing a military source, said any breach of Syria's airspace ""will be dealt with as an enemy military target"". Damascus and Ankara, which opposes Assad, have agreed Russia could control Idlib airspace.
The United Nations has warned fighting in Idlib could ""end in a bloodbath"" and called for a ceasefire. The latest Syrian offensive has prompted the biggest civilian exodus in a civil war that has killed an estimated 400,000 Syrians, displaced millions more and left much of the country in ruins. 
Separately in Syria's northeast, the UN has suggested that the Tal Abiyad border crossing between Syria and Turkey could be used to deliver aid to civilians after Russia and China blocked the world body from using a crossing point on the Iraqi border to provide help.

RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's famed Carnival (NYSE:CCL) kicked off in earnest on Saturday, as millions of scantily-clad revelers poured into the streets, many of whom took the opportunity to parody or otherwise comment on the nation's deeply polarized politics.
Since right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, Brazilians have been sharply divided, with supporters crediting the former army captain for a rapid drop in violent crime and an improving economy, while his detractors have denounced what they consider racism, sexism and disrespect for the poor.
Along with a clutch of conservative allies, including Rio de Janeiro's evangelical mayor Marcelo Crivella, Bolsonaro has shown little interest in Carnival and at times denounced what he sees as debauched behavior during the festivities.
To be sure, most partiers on Saturday were dressed in distinctly apolitical garb, ranging from mermaid to cowboy costumes, indicating Brazilians were focused on revelry first, and politics a distant second. 
But in the biggest cities, there was no love lost, as many costumes poked fun at Brazil's leaders.
In the northeastern city of Recife, home to one of the country's most famous Carnival celebrations, musician Antonio Nobrega dedicated an opening performance to Brazil's artists and journalists. Both those groups have repeatedly drawn ire from Brazil's political leaders, with politicians often singling out individual journalists and newspapers for criticism.
The famed Mangueira samba school, a type of performing troupe that spend months preparing elaborate parades for Carnival, has already ruffled feathers with plans to march through Rio de Janeiro's legendary Sambodromo on Sunday night with a performance expected to take jabs at police violence.
Under Bolsonaro, homicide rates in the city have plummeted, but killings by police have sky-rocketed, sparking a major debate about policing tactics, particularly in poor and minority communities.
Early on Saturday, the Tom Maior samba school paid homage during their performance to Marielle Franco, a black, lesbian Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman whose 2018 assassination triggered protests throughout the country.

""I thought it was beautiful, it really moved me,"" said Renato Santos Aguessy, a 37-year-old schoolteacher, who attended. ""She left a legacy for us of struggle, of confronting adversities in this country, which is being dominated by fascism.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations has suggested that the Tal Abiyad border crossing between Syria and Turkey could be used to deliver aid to civilians in northeast Syria after Russia and China blocked the world body from using a crossing point on the Iraqi border to provide help.
Last month, the U.N. Security Council allowed a six-year-long cross-border aid operation to continue from two places in Turkey, but dropped crossing points from Iraq and Jordan due to opposition by Russia and China. Council approval was needed because the Syrian government did not consent.
The 15-member council also asked Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to report back this month on any possible alternative routes to the Al Yarubiyah crossing between Syria and Iraq to ensure aid deliveries. Western diplomats have said Al Yarubiyah's closure cuts off 40 percent of medical aid to northeastern Syria.
""If viable alternatives to Al Yarubiah are not found for medical items, the gap between the humanitarian response and humanitarian needs will increase,"" Guterres wrote in his report to the council, seen by Reuters on Saturday.
""From a security and logistical perspective, in the current context, the Tal Abiyad border crossing would constitute the most feasible alternative,"" he said.
The report said that in December 2019 there were 103 medical facilities being supported by aid groups across northeast Syria.
""These medical facilities received a significant amount of their medical supplies from the United Nations through Al Yarubiyah. At least 50 of these medical facilities ... were supported solely with medicines provided cross-border,"" it said.
Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia last month dismissed concerns about closing the Iraq border crossing because he said the situation on the ground had changed and aid was being delivered to the northeast from within Syria.
Guterres' report said that the United Nations was able to transport 2.54 million medical treatments and 451 tonnes of medical equipment to northeast Syria from Damascus by air in 2019, but there were no road convoys with medical items.
""Air freight is significantly more expensive than road convoys,"" the report said, which also noted that Syrian government approval is needed for deliveries to the northeast and it ""usually takes three to four months to respond.""
Guterres noted in the report that ""in the absence of consent from the Syrian Government or neighboring countries to use border crossings into northeast Syria, the Security Council would need to authorize the United Nations and its implementing partners to use additional crossings.""
Turkey has sent thousands of troops and equipment to northwest Syria, just south of its border, to head off a push in recent weeks by Russia-backed Syrian government forces to retake the rebel-held territory after nine years of war."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Emperor Naruhito said on Sunday that he was looking forward to the Tokyo Olympics in summer but that he was concerned about the spread of the new coronavirus, which has killed three in Japan and is slowly spreading across the country.
Naruhito, who turned 60 on Sunday, ascended the throne last May after his father Akihito became the first Japanese emperor in two centuries to abdicate. The new emperor and his wife Empress Masako, 56, a former diplomat, have put a more relaxed face on one of the world's oldest monarchies.
Speaking at his first news conference since becoming emperor - and on his first birthday since then as well - Naruhito said the roughly 10 months since have been tumultuous for Japan, including several deadly typhoons last year and now the coronavirus. More than 80 people around Japan have tested positive for the virus and events have been canceled around the nation in an effort to halt the contagion.
""This new coronavirus is a concern. I would like to send my sympathies to those who are infected and their families,"" he said.
""At the same time, my thoughts are with the efforts of those who are treating them and working hard to prevent the spread of the infection. I hope their efforts will bear fruit soon.""
Tokyo will host the Summer Olympics from July 24 for the second time, and Naruhito said the first Tokyo games, held in October 1964 when he was four years old, were one of the highlights of his childhood.
Those games, held less than 20 years after a crushing defeat in World War Two left Tokyo in ruins, are seen in Japan as marking its return to the international community. Naruhito watched the marathon, equestrian events, and the closing ceremony with his parents, then Crown Prince and Princess.
""At the closing ceremony, the athletes didn't march in all their separate countries' teams but all together, and in such good humor,"" he said.
""That could be the basis of my unchanging and long-held, earnest hope for world peace."" 
Naruhito said he was looking forward to this Summer's games, which he hoped would become an equally vivid memory for all the athletes taking part.

""And I hope this Olympics and Paralympics will deepen understanding of other people in the world and the preciousness of peace - especially among young people.""

Macron was reacting after a man in the crowd at a farm show in Paris challenged him about the killings.
""I will call President Biya next week and we will put maximum pressure so that the situation ends,"" Macron said.
When the man in the crowd shouted: ""France must not support dictators,"" Macron replied: ""France has a complicated role in Africa. When France says a leader has not been democratically elected, Africans tell us: why are you meddling? I put pressure on everyone, I work with the African Union to put pressure.""
Gunmen in military uniforms and masks killed 22 people in a Feb. 14 attack in a village in western Cameroon, shooting women and children and burning others in their homes, the United Nations said on Monday.
Cameroon's army has been fighting since 2017 English-speaking militias seeking to form a breakaway state called Ambazonia amid the cocoa farms and forests of west Cameroon.
As fighting has intensified, so have abuses by both sides, witnesses and rights groups say.
The fighting is the gravest threat to stability in the oil- and cocoa-producing country since President Paul Biya took power nearly 40 years ago.
It was not yet clear who was responsible for Friday's attack in Ntumbo in the northwest region of Cameroon near the Nigerian border. In a statement, separatists blamed the army. In its own the statement, the army denied wrongdoing."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Anti-Western hardliners are set to sweep Iran's parliamentary elections and appear favorites to clinch the presidency next year, but an economic crisis could force them to engage with the United States despite their tightening grip on power.
Tehran has ruled out any talks with Washington unless it lifts crippling sanctions reimposed on Iran after U.S. President Donald Trump exited a 2015 multinational nuclear pact with Iran and demanded a broader deal.
But growing discontent over economic hardship, which led many Iranians to abstain from Friday's vote, could force the Islamic Republic's clerical rulers to choose diplomacy over the kind of confrontation that almost led to all-out war in January.
Some insiders said Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei may have to drink ""the cup of poison"", citing a phrase used by his predecessor Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini when he agreed to a U.N.-mediated truce that ended the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
Iran's fragile economy, weakened by a U.S. ""maximum pressure"" campaign that has choked vital oil exports and by corruption and mismanagement alienating many Iranians, leaves the Iranian authorities with few options.
The killing of Iran's most prominent commander Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. drone attack in Baghdad and Tehran's retaliation by launching missile attacks on U.S. targets in Iraq brought the arch foes to the brink of war in January.
""Iran is just one systemic crisis away from the breaking point,"" Michael Tanchum, senior fellow at the Austrian Institute for European and Security Policy (AIES), told Reuters.
""To avoiding this breaking point, Iran's hardliners may offer the U.S. concessions for the sake of the regime's survival.""
A host of disputes divide the two old foes.
Iran decries the U.S. military role in the Gulf. Washington objects to Iran's regional paramilitary alliances, its missile program and its nuclear work, which Tehran says is peaceful but Washington worries may be aimed at building a bomb.
Yet while the issues may be very difficult to resolve, simply starting direct talks on any of these questions would represent a diplomatic sea-change.
Iran's hardliners, long favored by Khamenei and ever more dominant after Friday's election, may now have the political space to engage with Washington if they judge it is necessary.
The advances by hardliners in parliamentary polls followed the disqualification of thousands of moderates and leading conservative candidates by a hardline vetting body, the Guardian Council that reports directly to Khamenei.
Iran's dual system of clerical and republican rule places decisive power in the hands of a hardline establishment, which has in the past tightened its grip on the apparatus of control when faced with external and internal threats.
Although parliament has no major influence on foreign affairs or nuclear policy, which is determined by Khamenei, a victory in Friday's election could shape Iran's politics for years to come by handing hardliners a bigger prize — a stronger platform to campaign in the 2021 presidential contest.
""Hardliners are eyeing the presidency,"" said a senior Iranian official, who like others contacted by Reuters for this story asked not to be named because of political sensitivities.
""A victory by hardliners in the presidential election, combined with growing economic hardship, might open a new chapter between Iran and America,"" the official said.
There is precedent for economic pain producing engagement.
Iran's sanctions-damaged economy forced Khamenei to give tentative backing to the nuclear pact engineered by pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani, which ended the country's economic and political isolation until Trump quit the deal in 2018.
""Remaining in power is the main concern for Iran's top leader. Securing the existence of the Islamic Republic mainly depends on improving the economy,"" said another senior official, close to the hardline camp. ""For the leader, the priority is to secure the interests of the Islamic Republic.""
INCREASING ANGER
Conservatives, who like hardliners support the theocracy but favor a less confrontational foreign policy, would back detente.
The struggle of ordinary Iranians to make ends meet has become harder since reimposition of the U.S. sanctions, which combined with the rising inflation, growing unemployment, a slump in the rial has caused Iran’s economy to deteriorate.
The establishment's core support comes from lower-income Iranians, who joined anti-government protests in November over a sudden hike in fuel prices. The unrest turned political with protesters demanding a ""regime change"".
The elite Revolutionary Guards responded with a harsh crackdown that saw hundreds killed and thousands jailed, but the unrest rattled clerical rulers by reminding them how vulnerable they are to popular anger over economic hardship.
Candidates affiliated with the Guards made a strong showing in parliamentary elections, leading the race in the capital Tehran and across Iran.
""In this ongoing process, the Guards will become an increasingly powerful force, extending its dominance in the military, intelligence and economic spheres onto the political one,"" said Ali Fathollah-Nejad, visiting Fellow at Brookings Doha Centre.
Demands by many pro-reform Iranians for social and political freedoms, however, are unlikely to be met. Hardliners, entrenched in institutions Khamenei controls such as the judiciary, are determined to prevent domestic liberalization."

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia plans to release an interim report into a deadly Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crash, which killed 157 passengers and crew, ahead of the first anniversary of the accident next month, according to an official speaking on Saturday.
""We are not ready to release the final report and so we are releasing an interim one which will come out before the anniversary of the accident. We are finalizing it,"" Amdye Ayalew, the country's chief crash investigator, told Reuters. He declined to give a precise date for the release of the final report.
Boeing's popular 737 MAX has been grounded globally since the March 10 crash, which killed everyone on board, and came just five months after a Lion Air crash in Indonesia which killed 189 in a plane of the same model.
Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed in an open field six minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital.
Under rules overseen by the United Nations' Montreal-based aviation agency, ICAO, Ethiopia should publish a final report by March 10, the crash anniversary. ICAO is not participating in the investigations into the incident.
Ethiopian Transport Ministry spokesman Musie Yehyies declined to explain why the final report was not being released and said on Saturday the investigations committee is expected to meet in the coming weeks to work on it.
A senior official at the ministry of transport, who spoke to Reuters on a condition of anonymity, said the final report was far from completion.
In April last year the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority released a preliminary report which revealed that faulty sensor readings and multiple automatic commands to push down the nose of the Boeing aircraft contributed to the fatal crash and left the crew struggling to regain control.
Experts said the preliminary document left unanswered questions, which are expected to be addressed in the interim report, on why the plane did not respond to pilot and automatic commands including two final nose up instructions from the pilots about 30 seconds before the crash.
Ethiopian Airlines and a Boeing representative in Ethiopia did not respond to requests for comment."

KABUL (Reuters) - Taliban fighters and Afghan security forces clashed in parts of Afghanistan on Saturday, a day after a week-long ""reduction in violence"" was announced, but the incidents did not spark immediate alarm on either side.
If the violence reduction period is observed successfully, the United States and the Taliban will sign an agreement on Feb. 29 that could lead to a pullout of thousands of U.S. troops after nearly two decades in the country.
Taliban fighters attacked Afghan forces in Balkh province in the early hours of Saturday, according to the spokesman for the provincial police and head of the provincial council.
The attack was confirmed by Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid in an audio message to Reuters. He said an Afghan forces convoy tried to enter territory controlled by the group.
The two sides have fought for control over parts of Balkh province for years.
The Taliban spokesman also confirmed similar clashes in other parts of the country, adding that the violence reduction understanding covered specific actions and areas and all incidents of firing should not be considered a violation of the understanding, which, he stressed, was ""not a ceasefire"".
There were no immediate details on the casualties in the clashes.
Meanwhile, speaking to journalists on Saturday morning, General Scott Miller, who commands U.S. forces and the NATO-led non-combat Resolution Support (RS) mission in Afghanistan, addressed the issue of what would constitute a breach of the understanding.
""It is about observable trends showing a reduction in violence and I am confident we will be able to understand that on a daily basis and as more days go on we'll have better understanding of what the trends are,"" he said standing alongside the Afghan defense and interior ministers.
Previous attempts at negotiating peace agreements have been scuttled by Taliban attacks on international forces, most recently in December last year when an attack on a U.S. military base put talks on hold."

Taking back the M5 highway from insurgents marks a big gain for President Bashar al-Assad, as it restores state control over the route between Syria's two biggest cities for the first time in years of conflict.
Control of the M5 has been seen as a main goal of the Syrian army's latest offensive. With Russian backing, government forces have gained ground in northwest Syria, the last major rebel stronghold, since December.
The United Nations says the offensive has uprooted nearly a million people, the largest exodus of the nine-year war.
""Transport Minister Ali Hammoud announces the opening of the Damascus-Aleppo highway to traffic, placing it at the service of citizens,"" the ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
Clearing insurgents from the highway was part of a 2018 Russian-Turkish deal that called for creating a buffer zone between combatants in the Idlib region of the northwest, though fighting has raged on.
Turkey has ""determined our road map"" for Syria after calls with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday. ""We will announce to all parties that we are at the table,"" he told a crowd in Izmir.
Under its agreements with Russia, Turkey has forces stationed at observation posts in the northwest.
Ankara and Moscow, which back opposing sides in Syria's conflict, have collaborated in trying to reach a political settlement. But tensions between the two sides have spiraled during the latest offensive, with both accusing the other of flouting agreements.
Turkey has warned that it will use military power to repel Syrian advances in the Idlib offensive, during which 15 Turkish soldiers have been killed this month.
In a phone call with his Turkish counterpart, Russia's defense minister discussed ""issues of stabilization"" in Idlib, Russian news agencies said on Saturday."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Candidates affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards looked on course to win a parliamentary majority on Saturday, reportedly leading in the race in Tehran and across the country after a vote stacked in favor of loyalists to the supreme leader.
The Interior Ministry said a list of candidates affiliated with the Guards led in the capital. An unofficial tally by Reuters shows hardliners have so far won about 178 seats in the 290-seat parliament, independents 43 and moderates 17. 
In some constituencies, where candidates failed to get 20 percent of votes cast on Friday, a run-off election will be held in April. 
A clean sweep for hardliners would confirm the political demise of the country's pragmatist politicians, weakened by Washington's decision to quit a 2015 nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions in a move that stifled rapprochement with the West.
However, Iranian authorities have yet to announce the turnout in the race for the 290-seat legislature - a litmus test of the popularity of hardliners closely associated with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Iran's rulers, under intense U.S. pressure over the country's nuclear program, need a high turnout to boost their legitimacy, damaged after nationwide protests in November. 
Such a result would help the Guards, already omnipresent in Iranians' daily lives, to increase their substantial influence in political, social and economic affairs.
The demonstrations, which called for regime change, were met with a violent crackdown overseen by the Guards that killed hundreds and led to the arrest of thousands, according to human rights organizations.
Iranians long for stability after a succession of political and economic crises. 
MOUNTING U.S. PRESSURE
In the latest challenge for Khamenei, Iran announced the detection of 10 new cases of coronavirus, one of whom has died. The new infections bring the total cases of new coronavirus in the country to 28, with five deaths. [nD5N27U00C]
Khamenei faces mounting pressure from the United States over Iran's nuclear program and discontent over mismanagement of the economy is unlikely to ease as sanctions squeeze the Islamic Republic.
President Donald Trump raised the stakes in his standoff with Tehran when Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, was killed in a U.S. drone strike at Baghdad airport in January.
The spokesman for the watchdog Guardian Council, Abbasali Kadkhodai, predicted that the turnout would be around 50%, telling state television on Friday that the Iranian nation had disappointed its enemies by voting in large numbers. 
Turnout was 62% in the 2016 parliamentary vote and 66% of people voted in 2012. 
Large gains in Friday's vote may also hand hardliners another bonus — more leeway to campaign for the 2021 contest for president, a job with wide day-to-day control of government. 
Parliamentary elections have little impact on Iran's foreign or nuclear policies, which are set by Khamenei, and major pro-reform parties have been either banned or dismantled since 2009.
But the vote reveals shifts in the factional balance of power in Iran's unique dual system of clerical and republican rule.

The Guardian Council, a hardline vetting body, has disqualified 6,850 hopefuls out of 14,000, ranging from moderates to conservatives, from contesting parliament polls. About a third of sitting lawmakers have also been barred.

Thomas Thabane was due to be charged on Friday, but he failed to appear in court and instead traveled to South Africa for what aides said was a medical appointment.
Police at the time threatened to issue an arrest warrant if there was evidence that Thabane, who denies involvement in the killing, was trying to evade justice.
His then-wife Lilipelo, 58, was shot dead in June 2017, two days before he took office for a second stint as premier, and two months before he married his current wife Maesaiah.
""New arrangements for him to appear before court shall be made as he has to be fit for an appearance,"" Deputy Police Commissioner Paseka Mokete told Reuters by telephone.
""So there is no warrant of arrest issued as yet. His sick leave starts from yesterday and ends on 27 February.""
Maesaiah Thabane, 42, has already been charged with ordering the killing but is currently out on bail. She has also denied involvement in the killing.
The murder case has triggered political turmoil in the tiny mountain kingdom of 2 million people, which is encircled by South Africa, whose soldiers have had to intervene in the past to restore order in a nation with a history of coups.
The prime minister has said he will resign at the end of July, and several members of his own All Basotho Convention (ABC) party have been pressuring him to go sooner.
With no clear candidate to succeed Thabane in the ABC, political analysts expect a general election soon."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A Jesuit priest who was murdered at the threshold of the Salvadoran civil war and who in death became a icon for human rights in rural Latin America was moved a step closer to sainthood by Pope Francis on Saturday.
The Vatican said the pope had approved a decree recognizing that Rutilio Grande and two lay Salvadorans were killed ""in hatred of the faith"".
This means they will be beatified without the customary need for a miracle to be attributed to them. Beatification is the last step before sainthood.
Grande, who was outspoken in his defense of the poor, was shot more than dozen times along with an elderly man and a teenager on March 12, 1977 by a right-wing death squad in rural El Salvador while they were riding in a jeep.
The assassination of Grande, who had organized peasants to fight for their rights, was so horrific that it convinced the then archbishop of the capital San Salvador, Oscar Romero, to take up Grande's mantle as defender of the poor.
Romero, who had been less outspoken until then, was himself killed by a death squad while he was saying Mass in the chapel of a hospital in San Salvador in 1980. Pope Francis made Romero a saint in 2018.
The murders were among the most shocking in the long conflict between a series of U.S.-backed governments and leftist rebels in El Salvador which thousands were killed by right-wing and military death squads.
Some 75,000 people were killed and 8,000 went missing in the 1980-1992 war.
Both Romero and Grande became icons for Latin America's poor, appearing on T-shirts similar to those bearing the image of Che Guevara.
But before Francis became pope in 2013, their sainthood causes ran into stiff opposition in the Vatican and among powerful conservatives in the Latin American Church who thought both figures were too political.
No date was given for the beatification ceremony but it will likely take place in El Salvador.
The Catholic Church teaches that only God performs miracles but that saints who are believed to be with God in heaven intercede on behalf of people who pray to them. A miracle is usually the medically inexplicable healing of a person.
For the three to be declared saints, miracles would have to be attributed to them."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai students are expected to stage a protest on Saturday against a court's decision that dissolved the country's second largest opposition party, less than a year after an election to end direct military rule.
The Constitutional Court on Friday disbanded the upstart Future Forward Party, which won more than 6 million votes last year and came in third, for accepting loans from its founder.
The court also banned 16 party executives from politics for 10 years, including its charismatic billionaire leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit.
The ban strengthens the position in parliament of a coalition led by Prime Minister Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the former junta leader who first took power in a 2014 coup.
The court’s ruling brought swift criticism from human rights groups and democracy advocates.
The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok also said on Saturday that the decision ""raises questions about their representation within Thailand’s electoral system."" 
The Student Union of Thailand said it will hold a ""No Justice in the Country"" rally at Thammasat University, to protest against unjust laws and the dissolution of Future Forward.
""We are holding the rally against the injustice in the country,"" student union president Jutatip Sirikhan, 21, told Reuters.
The health ministry warned against public gatherings during the outbreak of the coronavirus.
""A political gathering is not appropriate at this time and could increase risk of an outbreak,"" health official Tanarak Pipat said but added if there is a gathering, organizers should filter participants with flu-like symptoms and provide masks and hand gel.
Thailand has recorded 35 cases of the coronavirus.
Having been barred from office, Future Forward's leaders vowed to continue advocacy and political work across the country, including military reform and welfare policies from the former party's manifesto.
On Sunday, the former Future Forward Party's spokeswoman, Pannika Wanich will hold a ""no-confidence motion"" event in Bangkok ahead of a censure debate in parliament on Monday.
Amnesty International’s Regional Director Nicholas Bequelin said the court decision ""illustrates how the authorities use judicial processes to intimidate, harass and target political opposition. Thai authorities must reverse the dissolution decision and restore genuine rights to freedom of expression and association in the country.""
The party's dissolution was ""a knockout blow for Thailand’s teetering efforts to restore democratic rule after a military dictatorship,” Human Rights Watch Asia director Brad Adams said.
“This decision seriously weakens the political opposition for the benefit of the military-backed ruling party and unjustly cancels the votes of over six million Future Forward Party supporters,” Adams said.
""We hope that the will of Thai people will be adequately reflected by the Thai parliament,"" the Japanese Embassy in Bangkok told Reuters."

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghans on Saturday welcomed the pledge by the Taliban and U.S to reduce violence, despite uncertainty looming over the war-torn country.
Saturday was the first morning of a seven-day ""reduced violence"" period that is meant to lead to an agreement between the United States and the Taliban in Doha on Feb. 29.
If signed, the agreement and subsequent intra-Afghan talks represent a chance for peace and the potential pullout of thousands of U.S. troops who have been in Afghanistan since U.S.-led forces ousted the hardline Islamist Taliban from power in 2001.
Many Afghans said they were anxious about what might come next.
""As a citizen who has grown up after the U.S. takeover, I don't want to sacrifice everything,"" Baha Farkish, 18, a student of Kabul University, told Reuters, referring to the possibility that the Taliban would return to some sort of power.
""I don't want my country to lose the achievements of the last two decades,"" she said, adding, ""As a young Afghan, I expect to keep my freedom of speech and opinion after the peace agreement with Taliban.""
The Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 after seizing power following years of civil war, and imposed many restrictions on women and activities it deemed ""un-Islamic.""
Since 2001, the Taliban have led a violent insurgency against the internationally backed government, killing thousands.
""It doesn't feel very hopeful. We had ceasefires in the past, and they resulted in the Taliban coming to the cities and wherever they want,"" said Bushra Wared, 23, a business student at the American university of Afghanistan.
""We have always been terrified of the Taliban,"" she said. ""But, if that's the only option to reach a stable peace, we will have to change our mindsets because we don't want to lose more innocent souls.""
'STRANGE FEELING OF HAPPINESS'
The older generation, which lived through the civil war and subsequent puritan rule of the Taliban, was more optimistic.
""I have seen several regimes changing, nothing has made me this optimistic,"" said Mohammad Fardin, 55, who has run a shop in a busy Kabul marketplace for 42 years.
""Last night when I heard the news I had a strange feeling of happiness,"" said Samiullah, 41, a taxi driver in Kabul.
""I was impatiently waiting for the start of the day (Saturday, the first day of the reduced violence agreement) as someone waits for Eid, new year or any other special occasion,"" he added.
Previous attempts at negotiating peace have been scuttled by Taliban attacks, most recently last December, when an attack on a U.S. military base put talks on hold.
Residents in Balkh and Kunduz were more guarded, saying they would wait to see how things went.
CELEBRATIONS
In some parts of the country, the announcement of the reduction in violence was met with celebration.
Hundreds of residents in eastern Paktia province, hit hard by Taliban attacks over the years, gathered in capital city of Gardez, calling upon the Afghan government, the Taliban and international community to redouble efforts to end the war.
In Jalalabad, the capital of insurgency-racked Nangarhar province, residents got together for a mass cycling event to mark the beginning of the reduction in violence. Cyclists from Nangarhar, Kabul and other northern provinces took part in the event, including women.
Nangarhar has also suffered an insurgency by the Islamic State, which has attacked the Taliban, the Afghan government and its international allies.
""My three sons have been killed in wars so far: One son in the Afghan-Russian war, the second in the Hamid Karzai government and the third by Islamic State,"" said Shir Gul, 77, a worker in Jalalabad. ""If peace comes, I will take my grandchildren to the grave of my sons and congratulate my sons."""

Demonstrations have intensified since the resignation of President Nursultan Nazarbayev last March after almost three decades in power. Nazarbayev nominated close ally Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as successor, ensuring his victory in a subsequent snap election.
Tokayev has promised to adopt a more liberal approach towards dissent and ease the restrictions on protests and the creation of political parties. But some opposition activists dismissed the proposed reforms as cosmetic.
Protesters who gathered in the capital Nur-Sultan on Saturday held banners that read ""Why are people poor in rich Kazakhstan?"" and demanded the release of political prisoners in the country, which has significant oil resources.
Opposition supporters in Almaty, the country's largest city, gathered in greater numbers to demonstrate in a central square, voicing similar demands.
One of two separate protest groups in Almaty was led by activists trying to establish a new opposition party who complained the authorities had disrupted their founding congress by detaining and harassing would-be delegates.
The group's leader, journalist Zhanbolat Mamay, was detained late on Friday and charged with calling for a public rally not sanctioned by the government - which is illegal in the former Soviet republic of 19 million people.
Hundreds of policemen arrived on the scene, easily outnumbering the few dozen activists, and swiftly dispersed the rally.
Mamay and his supporters will press ahead with plans to establish the Democratic Party ahead of next year's parliamentary election, his wife Inga Imanbay told the rally before police led her away along with other protesters.
Hours later, supporters of another government critic, exiled former banker and politician Mukhtar Ablyazov, attempted to hold a demonstration at the same location.
The government has accused Ablyazov of embezzling billions of dollars from a local bank after having its chief executive murdered - allegations he denies.
Police made dozens more arrests at the second protest, bringing the total number of people detained to around 100. At least 18 people were detained at a rally in Nur-Sultan."

JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan's President Salva Kiir is due to swear in former rebel leader Riek Machar as his first vice president on Saturday after the two men agreed to form a unity government, a move that could definitively end years of fighting in the country.
Riek and Machar had repeatedly pushed back deadlines to form a government of national unity following a peace accord signed in 2018. The civil war killed 400,000 people and triggered Africa's biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
On Thursday, they met at State House and said that a government will be formed and they will resolve outstanding issues, such as the unification of the army, in the coming days. Kiir named Machar as his first vice president on Friday and the swearing-in is expected to take place at 2 p.m. (1100 GMT).
""The time for war is finished, now is time for peace and development,"" said Arkanjelo Tout, a resident in Juba, said on Friday. ""I am expecting the new government to put the interest of its people first.""
South Sudan gained independence in 2011 but descended into fighting two years later after Kiir sacked his then deputy Machar, who later went on to form a rebel faction.
""We are hoping that the new unity government would address the root causes of conflict to avoid going back to war again,"" Angelo Wani, another Juba Resident, told Reuters on Friday.
The country is almost entirely dependent on oil for revenues, and a binding peace agreement could unlock its reserves. Output currently stands at 180,000 barrels per day down from a peak of 250,000 bpd before the outbreak of the conflict in 2013.
However, analysts said that forming a government is only one step towards solidifying peace.
Resolving issues such as unifying the armed forces, the return of refugees and economic reforms are critical to long-lasting peace, said James Okuk, a senior researcher at the Juba-based Center for Strategic and Policy Studies.
""People will be watching and will be criticizing whoever is lazy to deliver on time,"" he said. ""Every citizen is expecting that this should be a serious government."""

LOME (Reuters) - Polling stations opened in Togo on Saturday for a presidential election expected to extend incumbent Faure Gnassingbe's 15-year hold on power, and his family's rule of more than half a century.
Many people in the West African country of around 8 million say they are fed up with the dynasty of Gnassingbe and his father Eyadema Gnassingbe, who seized power in a 1967 coup, and the persistent poverty during their tenures.
But the family has fended off various challenges to its rule, including protests that were met with deadly crackdowns in 2005 and 2017. Some political analysts expect Gnassingbe to win the election outright in the first round.
The election follows a constitutional revamp last year that limits presidents to two five-year terms. The reform was not retroactive, however, meaning the president could be in power for another decade.
""Like many Togolese, I voted for change. Here's to a new president coming to power,"" car mechanic Edoh Komi, 47, said after casting his vote in the seaside capital Lome.
Polling stations opened at 0700 GMT and are due to close at 1600 GMT. Provisional results are expected in six days. There were long queues outside some stations in Lome, which Gnassingbe has tried to turn into a regional transport and finance hub.
Gnassingbe faces six rivals from a divided and historically weak opposition, including Jean-Pierre Fabre, a former journalist and human rights campaigner who came second in elections in 2010 and 2015. He says he wants to restore democracy in Togo.
But analysts say Gnassingbe already weathered the most serious challenge to his political survival during the 2017 demonstrations, when he resisted protesters' calls to make a two-term limit of the presidency retroactive.
His concession in allowing at least some form of term limits was reminiscent of his father. Eyadema Gnassingbe ruled the former French colony as a dictator for 25 years before agreeing in a 1992 constitution to notional multi-party democracy and a limit of two presidential terms.
However, lawmakers amended the constitution 10 years later to allow him to run again. When he died in 2005, the military installed his son as interim president, ignoring a law that said the head of the national assembly should take over.
The winning candidate on Saturday must secure a majority of the vote to avoid a run-off, which would take place next month. The opposition candidates say a centralized counting system will help Gnassingbe to cheat, a charge his government denies.
If elected, Gnassingbe has said he will continue reforms that have helped achieve annual economic growth of around 5% in recent years. Even so, over half of the population lives in poverty, according to the African Development Bank."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will raise the issue of religious freedom in India during his meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi next week, a senior administration official said, a sensitive subject for the Indian government.
Modi's government has faced large scale-protests at home and criticism abroad for enacting a citizenship law that is seen as discriminating against Muslims and has deepened concerns his administration in undermining India's secular traditions.
That measure came months after the Indian government withdrew the special autonomy given to the Muslim-majority territory of Kashmir, tightening its hold. It also jailed dozens of political opponents and separatists and imposed a communications blackout.
Trump, who is due in India on Monday, will talk about the two countries' shared traditions of democracy and religious freedom, the senior administration official said in a conference call on Friday ahead of the two-trip.
""He will raise these issues, particularly the religious freedom issue, which is extremely important to this administration,"" the official said.
Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party denies any bias against the country's 180 million Muslims.
It has strongly rebuffed foreign criticism, saying the changes in Kashmir and the new citizenship law were internal matters. In recent months, New Delhi has clashed with Muslim-majority countries such as Turkey and Malaysia after they criticized the government's policies.
Modi, who has built a personal rapport with Trump, is pulling out all the stops for the visit, which will kick off in his political hometown of Ahmedabad with a massive public reception.
Soon after winning a second term in office last year, Modi had spoken about his government's priority of inclusive growth for everyone, including religious minorities, the administration official said.
""And I think that the President will talk about these issues in his meetings with Prime Minister Modi and note that the world is looking to India to continue to uphold its democratic traditions, respect for religious minorities,"" the official said.
Trump has faced criticism at home for imposing a travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries, a move he has argued is necessary to guard against terrorism. 
Four U.S. senators wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this month, saying Modi's steps in Kashmir and the citizenship laws were troubling and ""threaten the rights of certain religious minorities and the secular character of the state.""
The bipartisan group of Senators Lindsey Graham, Todd Young, Chris Van Hollen and Dick Durbin asked the State Department for information in 30 days about the number of political detainees in Kashmir, restrictions on the internet and cell phone service, and access for foreign diplomats, journalists and observers.
They also expressed concern over the crackdown on protesters opposing the citizenship law, which lays out a path to Indian nationality for six religious groups from neighboring countries including Hindus, Sikhs and Christians, but not Muslims.

Daniel Horton, charged with section 18 GBH and possession of a bladed article, is due to appear in custody at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Feb. 22, Police said http://news.met.police.uk/news/man-charged-following-stabbing-at-mosque-395071. 
Raafat Maglad, the prayer leader who was stabbed around the top of his shoulder by the attacker, said in a BBC interview https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-51590550 that he did not hate his attacker and felt sorry for him. 
""I just felt blood flowing from my neck and that's it, they rushed me to the hospital. Everything happened all of a sudden,"" Maglad told BBC.

He said Attorney General Taj-Elsir Ali would head the committee and a final report would be issued within seven days.
On Thursday, Sudanese security forces used teargas and batons to disperse thousands of protesters. They were demanding the reinstatement of army officers dismissed for refusing to crack down on demonstrations against former President Omar al-Bashir, witnesses said.
A doctors' committee linked to the opposition said in a statement that at least 17 people were wounded, and many of the wounded were hit by teargas canisters.

KIEV (Reuters) - Julia Volok says some of her fellow passengers expected a warm welcome on their arrival in Ukraine after finally being evacuated from the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic in China's Hubei province this week.
Instead Volok, a 26-year-old Chinese-language student, and her fellow evacuees found their buses being pelted with projectiles by protesters on Thursday as they approached the sanatorium where they have started a mandatory two-week quarantine.
""We heard the window smash and everyone fell down into the aisle,"" she told Reuters by phone.
""No country has met its citizens like that,"" she said. ""We were bombarded, as enemies of the people, and this is very unpleasant. ... We have not done anything wrong to anyone.""
Despite repeated reassurances from the government that there was no danger, the protesters feared being infected by the virus. Ukraine has no confirmed coronavirus cases and the government says all evacuees were screened before being allowed to board their flight home.
The protests have died down and Volok and the others have now settled into the sanatorium, joined by Health Minister Zoriana Skaletska, who will stay there for the duration of their quarantine in an act of solidarity after Thursday's violence.
One of the other Ukrainians inside, Aleksandra Volkova, had posted footage on social media of a room inside the facility which had basic furniture, a door that did not lock and a shower which she said gave her an electric shock.
But Volok stressed that these were minor problems and that the evacuees were happy and also grateful to the police, some of whom were injured while protecting them from the protesters.
""The fact that the door does not close is a small problem. We are not here for life, two weeks is not such a long time,"" she said.
Her room has a TV. The inmates have been given a SIM card to make phone calls. They can finally eat Ukrainian food after spending time abroad.
""Beet salad is a huge delight,"" Volok said.
She had been in China for a year-and-a-half, studying Chinese in Beijing, and had been in Wuhan in the Hubei province on holiday.
She spent her last weeks there shut up in her home, waiting to be evacuated, and lived off the food she already had in her house.
To pass the time in the sanatorium, she plans to do some exercise inside the room and read books she has downloaded."

During his regular morning news conference, Lopez Obrador said government workers could join the event but suggested some activists were simply seeking to use the protest to undermine his government.
The strike is scheduled for March 9. Promotions began circulating this week on social networks under the slogan ""A Day Without Women."" It comes amid public outrage sparked by the murder of a seven-year-old girl and a woman skinned by her partner.
Lopez Obrador said he will respect the strike and there will be no punishment for civil servants who join. But he did not openly support the event and asked women to take care ""not to be manipulated.""
""(We must) be careful because conservatism, the right, is very hypocritical,"" he said. ""They promote these movements against progressive governments.""
If the event takes place, it would be the first national strike featuring only women in the history of Mexico.
""Not a woman in the streets, at work, in schools, in universities or shopping,"" reads the call to strike being distributed on social media.
Interior Minister Olga Sanchez declared her support. ""Solidarity as a woman, and in my personal capacity, I join the #NationalStrike on March 9,"" she wrote in a post on Twitter.
Opposing political parties have voiced their support for the strike."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have decided not to use the word ""royal"" in their branding after they start a new life in Canada following their decision to step back from royal duties.
The decision follows weeks of talks between the couple and the British royal family about how they will present themselves to the world in the future.
The couple agreed last month with Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, that they would no longer work as royals after their surprise announcement that they wanted to carve out a ""progressive new role"" which they hope to finance themselves.
""It has been agreed that their non-profit organisation, when it is announced this Spring, will not be named Sussex Royal Foundation,"" a spokeswoman for the couple said. 
""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex do not intend to use ‘SussexRoyal’ in any territory post Spring 2020.""
As things stand, Harry and Meghan use the brand extensively.
The couple's Instagram account, which has 11.2 million followers, uses the name SussexRoyal, as does a website set up by the couple which they used to declare they were seeking to be more independent. These will now have to be rebranded. 
They also applied to trademark the phrases Sussex Royal and Sussex Royal Foundation for use on books, stationery, clothing such as pyjamas and socks, charity campaigns and the provision of training, sport and social care.
The trademark applications that were filed have been removed, the spokeswoman said. 
The future role of the couple has been subject of intense public scrutiny in Britain. There has been much debate about the extent to which the couple should be able to commercialise the royal brand while living independently, at least partly abroad.
Earlier this week, Prince Harry and Meghan announced they will formally step down from their roles as working members of the royal family at the end of March.
Harry has spoken of his sadness at being forced to give up his royal duties, saying there was no other option if he and Meghan, an American actress, were to seek an independent future away from stifling media intrusion.

Under the arrangement, Harry will remain a prince and the couple will keep their Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles as they begin a new life split between Britain and North America, where they will spend most of their time.

Any deliveries of weapons to Libya would be in violation of a United Nations embargo, although U.N. officials say the embargo has been subject to frequent violations.
The vessel, the Bana, was blocked by police in Genoa harbor on Feb. 3.
It was then searched after a ship's officer told Italian authorities that weapons had been loaded onto the ship at the Turkish port of Mersin then transported to the Libyan capital Tripoli, a judicial source said.
The shipment included tanks, howitzers, machineguns and air defense systems, the source said.
The ship was originally scheduled to sail from Turkey to Genoa. But according to the informant, who has requested political asylum, Turkish military officers escorting the shipment had told the crew to declare that the stop in Tripoli was due to mechanical problem.
The Bana then continued without cargo to Genoa in order to load cars in the Italian port, chief prosecutor Franco Cozzi said.
The ship's captain, Joussef Tartiussi, a Lebanese national, was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of trying to influence his crew's testimony and concealing evidence, Cozzi said.
Tartiussi's lawyer declined to comment.
The Turkish government backs Fayez al-Sarraj, prime minister of Libya's internationally-recognized government, which has been fighting since last April for control of Tripoli against the Libyan National Army led by eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar.
Italian authorities are analyzing the ship's navigation equipment and mobile phones of crew members with the aim of verifying the route followed by the Bana, whose transponders were turned off after it left the Turkish port, Cozzi said.
He said that even though the alleged trafficking had not taken place in Italian waters, it was still necessary to carry out the investigation because if it had occurred, any arms deliveries would be in violation of the U.N. embargo."

Bolivia's electoral body said on Thursday that Morales was ineligible to run for a Senate position in the May 3 election re-run of a voided vote late last year that sparked a political crisis and led to his resignation.
Morales, currently in Argentina after leaving Bolivia following his resignation in November, is orchestrating his socialist party's election campaign and had been angling to become a senator. He is banned from running for president.
The block on Morales' run is based on his not fulfilling criteria including being a permanent resident in Bolivia. Morales' lawyers said that this was unfounded.
""Evo Morales is not outside Bolivia voluntarily, but out of necessity. There was a situation of force majeure, where if he had stayed in Bolivia he was killed,"" lawyer Eugenio Raúl Zaffaroni told reporters in Buenos Aires.
Morales left Bolivia shortly after his resignation following weeks of protests that were sparked by a disputed October election in which he had sought a fourth straight term. Police and military forces eventually pulled their backing for him.
Morales, who ran the landlocked nation for almost 14 years, took up asylum first in Mexico before moving to Argentina.
A second lawyer, Gustavo Ferreyra, said Morales had been encouraged to take up the matter with Bolivian and international bodies.
""We have advised Evo Morales to go to all national and international authorities in order to ensure the widest protection of his rights,"" he said.
Morales, who has criticized Bolivia's interim government and opposition to his Movement for Socialism party for leading what he calls a right-wing coup against him, slammed the decision to prevent him running as undemocratic.

""You can do whatever you want with me, but do not destroy democratic rights and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Do not destroy Bolivia,"" he said.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Victims of sexual abuse by Catholic priests at a school for the deaf in Argentina staged a protest at the Vatican on Friday to bring attention to an upcoming trial of more alleged abusers.
Last November a court in the province of Mendoza convicted two priests and the former gardener at a Catholic Church-run school on 28 counts of sexual abuse and corruption of minors.
Trials for about 10 others who worked at the Antonio Provolo Institute for the deaf, including teachers and a nun, are expected to start in a few months. They are accused of abetting the abuse by the priests.
About 20 people, including several former students, held up signs reading ""Zero Tolerance,"" ""Don't Forget,"" and ""We Are Not Going Away"" in front of the building housing the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine for the Faith, which handles abuse cases. The victims' lawyers and other victims of abuse were among those who joined the protest.
""Church officials in Argentina are not cooperating with civil authorities and not cooperating with prosecutors concerning the rape and sexual abuse of dozens of deaf children in Argentina,"" Peter Isely, a founder of the advocacy group Ending Clergy Abuse (ECA), told Reuters at the demonstration.
The case in Argentina and a similar one at a school for the deaf in Italy have prompted outrage because of the particular vulnerability of the children and their difficulty in communicating about the crimes.
ECA and several other groups of victims traveled to Rome to mark the first anniversary of a Church summit on sexual abuse at the Vatican.
They say Pope Francis and Vatican officials have not done enough to make bishops and other members of the Catholic Church hierarchy accountable for the cover-up of sexual abuse.
The two priests convicted in last November's trial were given sentences of 42 and 45 years in prison respectively while the school employee was given 18 years. They are appealing the ruling.
The Catholic Church around the world is still struggling to come to grips with the worldwide crisis, most of which involves cases of abuse that happened decades ago.
It has devastated the Church's credibility and dented its coffers. About two dozen dioceses in the United States alone have filed for bankruptcy because of mounting lawsuits.
A number of U.S. states have also changed statutes of limitations law enabling victims to file for damages for abuse that occurred decades ago.

Jan Kuciak and his fiancée were shot dead on Feb. 21, 2018 in a case that prosecutors traced to an influential businessman, who is now standing trial for procuring the murder. Three others are charged with helping organize and carry out the murder. 
The businessman, Marian Kocner, has denied the charges. One of the others charged has admitted to shooting the couple, while the two others have pleaded not guilty. Another man was sentenced to 15 years after a deal with the prosecution under which he admitted to helping facilitate the murder.
Prosecutors have said evidence showed Kocner had communicated with figures in state bodies and the justice system, and several senior officials were forced to resign.
""They uncovered scandals, theft, corruption on the highest levels,"" said Iveta Kovacova, one of those gathered at a commemoration in the capital, Bratislava, holding a banner mourning the slain young couple.
""But I think a lot of work still must be done for this country to run normally.""
Prime Minister Robert Fico was forced to resign after the murders but his center-left Smer party stayed in power and remains the most popular group.
Still, the party has lost a large part of its support ahead of the Feb. 29 parliamentary election. 
Final opinion polls last week showed a group of five to six opposition parties ranging from progressives to conservatives may try to join forces to oust Smer from power, with anti-graft movement Ordinary People and Independent Personalities (OLANO) closing in on Smer.
Kuciak's father, Jozef Kuciak, called on people to vote.

JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan's President Salva Kiir appointed former rebel leader Riek Machar as the country's first vice president on Friday, a day after the two men agreed to form a government of national unity.
Oil-rich South Sudan secured independence from its northern neighbor Sudan in 2011 but plunged into civil war two years later. Fighting claimed an estimated 400,000 lives and sparked the biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
The conflict was triggered by Kiir's sacking of his then deputy Machar, who proceeded to form a rebel faction against the government.
""I President Salva Kiir Mayardit, president of South Sudan, do hereby issue a decree for the appointment of Dr. Riek Machar Teny as first vice president of South Sudan with immediate effect,"" said a statement read on state television.
On Thursday, the former rivals agreed to create a unity government before a February 22 deadline, paving the way for today's appointment.
A previous November 12 deadline was pushed back as key aspects of a 2018 peace agreement, including agreements on the number of states and unification of the army, had not been met.
This led the United States to impose sanctions on some political leaders.
But last Saturday, Kiir agreed to reduce the number of states to 10 from 32, a crucial opposition demand.
Other components of the peace agreements remain outstanding. Kiir said on Thursday that they would be finalised in the coming days.
Machar is due to be sworn into office on Saturday, alongside three other vice presidents appointed to their roles on Friday.
Kiir also dissolved the country's cabinet. He appointed a new minister of presidential affairs and a national security advisor. The rest of the cabinet is expected to be named on Saturday."

Prosecutors said they had charged Sergey Viacheslavovich Fedotov, Sergey Viktorovich Pavlov and Georgi Gorshkov in absentia. They said the men, who used false identities when they traveled abroad, were currently living in Moscow.
Fedotov also went by the alias D.V.S. prosecutors said. The initials match the name Denis Vyacheslavovich Sergeev, a high-ranking officer of Russia's GRU military intelligence service, who operated internationally under the name Sergey Fedotov, according to investigative website Bellingcat.
In October 2018, Russian news website Fontanka named Fedotov as a suspect in the Skripal case.
Moscow never comments on the identity of GRU staff, but has denied involvement in the poisoning of Skripal.
""We have identified the men. The names we revealed are the ones we have worked with so far. We believe the initials we have also published represent their genuine identities,"" a spokeswoman for Sofia Prosecutor's Office told Reuters.
The three Russians were charged with trying to kill arms factory owner Emilian Gebrev and two other Bulgarians in Sofia between April 28 and May 4, 2015 by ""intoxication with an unidentified organophosphorus substance,"" in a way that was ""dangerous to the lives of many"".
Gebrev and the two other victims fell ill but survived.
Prosecutors said they were cooperating with U.S. and British services on the investigation.
Bulgaria, a close satellite of Moscow during Soviet times, declined to join its allies in the European Union and NATO in expelling Russian diplomats over the Skripal case in 2018.
But it has recently adopted a tougher stance. Since October it has kicked out three Russian envoys accused of espionage and refused a visa for an incoming Russian military attache."

GENEVA/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United Nations warned on Friday that fighting in northwest Syria could ""end in a bloodbath"" and called again for a ceasefire, while Moscow denied reports of a mass flight of civilians from a Russian-led Syrian government offensive.
Syrian troops backed by Russian air power have been battling since December to eliminate the last rebel strongholds in the region in a war that has killed an estimated 400,000 Syrians, displaced millions more and left much of the country in ruins.
The latest offensive in the regions of Aleppo and Idlib has uprooted nearly 1 million people - most of them women and children - who have fled clashes to seek sanctuary further north, near the Turkish border.
The U.N.'s humanitarian agency OCHA said 60% of the 900,000 people trapped in a shrinking space after fleeing are children.
""We call for an immediate ceasefire to prevent further suffering and what we fear may end in a bloodbath,"" OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke told a news briefing in Geneva.
""The front lines and relentless violence continue to move closer to these areas which are packed with displaced people, with bombardments increasingly affecting displacement sites and their vicinity."" 
At a university building in the town of Azaz in northwest Syria, people fleeing Idlib have poured in every day to shelter from the violence and bitter cold. 
Souad Saleh, 58, is staying in a room with her family and dozens of other people. ""We want to go back home but we can't. We left things behind because the warplanes were above us and houses were collapsing,"" she said.
The escape was exhausting. ""Everyone was crying,"" the grandmother recalled, bursting into tears. 
Hayat al-Fayad, 50, said her village in Idlib had emptied out since her family ran from the bombing some two weeks ago. ""The entire village fled,"" she said.
Other families are sleeping outside by roads and in olive groves, burning garbage to stay warm. Some children have died from the cold, while some families have at least reached tent camps for displaced people.
Turkey, which currently hosts 3.7 million Syrian refugees, has said it cannot handle a new influx and has warned that it will use military power to repel Syrian advances in Idlib and ease a humanitarian crisis.
RUSSIA DENIES HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY
Russia's Defense Ministry said reports of hundreds of thousands of Syrians fleeing from Idlib towards the Turkish border - in an area where Turkish forces maintain forward observation posts - were false, urging Ankara to enable Idlib residents to enter other parts of Syria.
Turkey and Russia back opposing sides in Syria's conflict, but have collaborated towards a political solution. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's onslaught in the northwest has upset this fragile cooperation, causing Ankara and Moscow to accuse each other of flouting de-escalation agreements in the region.
Turkish and Russian officials have failed to find a solution to the clashes in several rounds of talks, and a flare-up on the ground on Thursday which killed two Turkish soldiers brought the total Turkish fatalities in Idlib this month to 15 troops.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan emphasized the necessity to control Syrian government forces and to ease a humanitarian crisis in Syria's Idlib region during a phone call with Russia's Vladimir Putin.
Speaking to reporters earlier, Erdogan said the French and German leaders had proposed a four-way summit with Russia in Istanbul on March 5, but that Putin had not yet responded. He repeated that Turkey was not withdrawing its forces from Idlib.
Erdogan further said Turkey was continuing work to set up housing for Syrian migrants in a 30-35 km (19-22 mile) ""safe zone"" inside Syria along the border with Turkey.
Earlier on Friday, the Kremlin said it was discussing the possibility of holding the summit with Turkey, France and Germany mentioned by Erdogan. 
The German and French leaders called Putin on Thursday to voice alarm about the humanitarian situation.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel also held a phone call with Erdogan, who asked Paris and Berlin for concrete support in the crisis.

Striking workers blocked access to Notimex offices shortly after midnight and were not allowing employees to enter, but the agency's journalists were still working remotely, according to the head of the union Adriana Urrea.
The conflict follows months of discord fanned by the firing of dozens of Notimex staff, who denounced the decision and have criticized the head of the agency, Sanjuana Martinez, who was tapped a year ago by Lopez Obrador.
During his first full year in office, Lopez Obrador has pushed broad austerity cuts across the government while committing to avoid tax hikes or taking on new debt as the economy has sputtered.
In a post on its Twitter account early on Friday, Notimex refused to recognize the strike, arguing that a notary did not formally certify it.
Urrea, however, said the work stoppage was in compliance with all applicable laws, and she criticized Notimex management for failing to provide promised benefits to some employees while seeking to pressure workers to accept contract changes.
""It's important to reestablish a dialogue between the company and the union, which is what broke down last year due to the arrival of (Martinez),"" said Urrea, an ex-Notimex journalist who was fired last year.
Urrea said 241 Notimex workers have been fired since Martinez took over, an action the union is seeking to reverse.
The strike marks only the second time Notimex employees have walked out in the outlet's 51-year history."
585,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 12:06PM ET</span>","Iranians vote in parliamentary election, hardliners set to cement grip","By Parisa Hafezi and Babak Dehghanpisheh
DUBAI (Reuters) - Hardliners loyal to Iran's supreme leader are likely to sweep a parliamentary election on Friday that will cement their grip on power as the country faces mounting U.S. pressure over its nuclear program and growing discontent at home. 
The vote will have no major influence on foreign affairs or Iran’s nuclear policy, which is determined by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But it might bolster hardliners in the 2021 contest for president and toughen Tehran's foreign policy. 
State television said voting was extended by four hours beyond the official 1430 GMT closing time to allow latecomers to cast ballots. In mid-afternoon, an Interior Ministry official said that about 11 million of 58 million eligible voters had voted for candidates in the 290-member parliament. 
Iranian authorities earlier forecast a turnout of about 50%, compared to 62% and 66% respectively in the 2016 and 2012 votes.
Disenchantment among many women and the young - who comprise a majority of voters - over high unemployment, soaring inflation and restrictions on personal freedoms in the Islamic Republic looked likely to depress the turnout. 
Big gains by anti-Western security hawks loyal to Khamenei were in the offing after the mass disqualification of moderate and leading conservative figures by a hardline watchdog body, the Guardian Council. 
A victory by acolytes of Khamenei in the election, seen as a referendum on the popularity of clerical rulers, could weaken pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani, who won the last two elections on promises to open Iran to the outside world.
The United States' 2018 withdrawal from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, and its reimposition of sanctions, have hit Iran's economy hard and led to widespread hardships.
A U.S. drone strike killed Iran's most prominent military commander, Qassem Soleimani, in Iraq on Jan. 3. Iran retaliated by firing ballistic missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq, killing no one but causing brain injuries in over 100 soldiers.
Encouraging Iranians to vote, state TV aired footage of people lined up at polling stations set up mainly at mosques. 
""I am here to vote. It is my duty to follow martyr Soleimani's path,"" said a young voter at a mosque at a cemetery, where Soleimani is buried in his hometown. 
Soleimani, architect of Tehran’s overseas clandestine and military operations as head of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, was a national hero to many Iranians. He was Iran's most powerful figure after Khamenei.
Rouhani urged Iranians to ""further disappoint the enemies"" by voting in large numbers.

Iranians who joined large protests in November called on their leaders to focus on improving the battered economy and tackling state corruption, also urging Khamenei to step down.
""I don't care about this election. Moderates or hardliners, they are all alike. We are getting poorer with each passing day,"" university student Pouriya, 24, said by telephone from the city of Isfahan. ""I am leaving Iran soon. There are no jobs, no future for us."" 
Iranians contacted by Reuters in several cities by telephone reported that turnout was low. 
""In my area in central Tehran not many people are voting. There is one polling station just beside my house in Javadiyeh and only a handful of voters were there when I last checked an hour ago,"" said sports teacher Amirhossein, 28. 
With Iran facing worsening isolation on the global stage and frustration at home over difficulties of many Iranians in making ends meet, analysts described the election as a litmus test of the leaders' handling of various political and economic crises.
Health ministry authorities advised voters not to be concerned about the threat of new coronavirus cases, as Tehran confirmed 13 new ones on Friday, two of whom have died.
""This is our enemies' propaganda to prevent us from voting. I voted for the Tehran list a couple of hours ago,"" said Zahra Sabeti, 19, in Mashhad. 
In Tehran, which accounts for 30 seats in parliament, the hardline candidates were headed by Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, a former mayor of the capital who once commanded the elite Revolutionary Guards.
""RELIGIOUS DUTY"" 
The slate of candidates was dominated by Khamenei's disciples, including former members of the Guards, who answer directly to the supreme leader, and their affiliated Basij militia, insiders and analysts said.
Khamenei was the first to cast his ballot, saying voting is ""a religious duty"". 
The Guardian Council, whose 12 members are all appointed directly or indirectly by Khamenei, disqualified 6,850 moderates and leading conservatives from the field, citing various grounds such as ""corruption and being unfaithful to Islam"".
That left voters with a choice mostly between hardline and low-key conservative candidates. On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on members of the Council over the candidate bans.
Iran's rulers have faced a legitimacy crisis since last year when protests over a fuel price hike turned political with demonstrators calling for ""regime change"". The unrest was met with the bloodiest crackdown since the Islamic Revolution, with hundreds of protesters killed.
Many Iranians are also angry over the shooting-down of a Ukrainian passenger plane in error in January that killed all 176 people on board, mainly Iranians. After days of denials, Tehran said the Guards were to blame.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's government faced calls to toughen gun ownership laws and step up efforts to track far-right sympathizers after the suspect in one of its worst mass shootings since World War Two was found to have published a racist manifesto.
The 43-year-old presumed killer of nine people in two shisha bars in the southwestern town of Hanau late on Wednesday had posted the document, espousing conspiracy theories and deeply racist views, online.
The suspect, who is believed to have killed himself and his mother after the shootings, belonged to a gun club, raising questions as to how a man with such ideological convictions managed to gain membership and obtain the weapons he used.
""We need new and stricter laws to regularly and thoroughly check owners of hunting and firearm licenses,"" Bild - Germany's biggest-selling newspaper - wrote on its front page. ""We immediately need more (intelligence) positions to monitor right-wing radicals and intervene before it's too late."" 
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer later told Bild that the government would initiate reforms to intensify checks on gun owners. ""This is not only about the question of whether someone has properly stored his weapon or kept the ammunition separate from it - it must also be about very personal matters,"" he said. 
Federal Prosecutor General Peter Frank said on Friday that the suspect had a license for two weapons, and it remained unclear whether he had contacts with other far-right sympathizers at home or abroad.
Frank added that the gunman had sent a letter to prosecutors in November complaining about an unknown intelligence agency with powers to control people's thoughts and actions. 
""The letter did not include his racist calls for the extermination of certain peoples,"" Frank told a news conference. ""We did not launch an investigation based on the letter, which later appeared in the gunman's racist manifesto.""
German media speculated that the gunman may have suffered from mental illness. Joerg Meuthen, a senior member of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD), tweeted: ""He should have been in a psychiatric ward! Instead, they want to blame us for it.""
Michael Roth, Germany's State Secretary for Europe, called the AfD ""the political arm of right-wing terrorism"" after the shooting spree. 
In October, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government outlawed the sale of guns to members of extremist groups monitored by security agencies and obliged online platforms to inform police about hate content.
Those measures followed the killing of a pro-immigration German politician in June and an attack four months later on a synagogue and a kebab shop in Halle by an anti-Semitic gunman who livestreamed his actions.
At least five of the Hanau victims were Turkish nationals, Ankara's ambassador to Berlin said on Thursday. His government demanded a robust response, calls echoed by representatives of Germany's large Kurdish community.
BETTER LAWS, OR BETTER CITIZENS?
Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian CSU, the sister party to Merkel's CDU, said security forces have had successes in preventing hate crime, citing this month's arrest of a far-right group accused of planning attacks against minorities.
But the threat from right-wing extremism, anti-Semitism and racism remained ""very high"" and existing laws needed to be enforced more robustly, he said.
Germany already has one of the lowest rates of death by firearms of any country. One member of Merkel's CDU questioned what more could be gained by additional legislation.
""It will remain difficult to identify people who radicalize themselves in isolation and become lone perpetrators,"" lawmaker Mathias Middelberg told the Deutschlandfunk public radio.
For others, the killings are rooted in deeper social issues that need to be tackled at source.
""Actions by the state are not enough. Each of us has a responsibility,"" the chief editor of daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung wrote in a commentary. 

""That begins with bad jokes and doesn't just end with an unquestioning acceptance of everyday racism. We need to clearly call out such things for what they are.""

The new cases in the UAE were detected in a 34-year-old Filipino national and a 39-year-old Bangladeshi national who had contact with a Chinese national who had been diagnosed with the virus, the health ministry said in a statement.
It said the two were in stable condition.
More than 2,100 people have died in China from the new virus that emerged in Wuhan in December. New research suggesting the virus is more contagious than previously thought has added to the international alarm over the outbreak.
The UAE, a major international air transit centre and tourism and business hub, recorded its first coronavirus case on Jan. 28 when four members of a Chinese family were diagnosed.
It has since suspended passenger flights to mainland China, with the exception of Beijing.
Most of those diagnosed in the UAE with the virus have been Chinese citizens. Another Filipino national and one Indian national have also been infected, according to the health ministry.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Nineteen Taiwanese citizens arrived back home clad in full protective suits on Friday after spending more than two weeks stuck on a quarantined cruise ship in a Japanese port due to the coronavirus outbreak.
""I have never been this happy before to return to Taiwan...I almost burst into tears the moment the aircraft touched down,"" one of the passengers, Sunny Chen, said in a social media post.
The 19 landed on a chartered China Airlines plane at the island's main airport in Taoyuan, live television channels showed. They were taken by ambulances and will be put into quarantine after further medical checks, the health ministry said.
More than 620 passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise liner have been infected with the coronavirus, the most outside mainland China.
It has been quarantined in Yokohama port since Feb. 3 and initially had about 3,700 passengers and crew on board. Hundreds of international passengers from the ship have now left for chartered flights home including those from the United States, Hong Kong and Canada.
""I'd like to thank all the government agencies and medical staff...We will accept Taiwan's further quarantine,"" Chen said in his post, which showed him wearing a mask, goggle and full protective suit while the plane taxied down the runway.
Authorities said five Taiwanese nationals have tested positive for the virus on the ship and remained in Japan.
Taiwan now has 26 confirmed cases. It has banned entry to Chinese visitors and foreigners with a recent history of travel to China and suspended most flights to its neighbour.
A taxi-driver died from the new coronavirus last week, the first such fatality in Taiwan.
The government this week proposed a bill to penalize those who violated home quarantine orders, saying a violation would be fined up to T$2 million ($65,845) or two years in jail.
In a response to panic buying of masks, the government is building several mask production lines and Premier Su Tseng-chang said Taiwan will more than double its daily mask production to 10 million by early March."

JAKARTA (Reuters) - An international financial watchdog placed Myanmar on its money-laundering watchlist on Friday, urging the country at the heart of Asia's illicit drug-producing ""Golden Triangle"" to boost its efforts to seize crime proceeds.
The decision by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to include Myanmar on its ""gray list"", which Reuters reported on this week, puts the Southeast Asian nation on notice to make good on a ""high-level"" commitment to strengthen its anti-money laundering regime.
A spokesperson for Myanmar's government could not be contacted on Friday but its representative at this week's FATF meetings, Kyaw Win Thein, told Reuters on Wednesday that the country had a detailed strategic implementation plan to counter money-laundering.
The FATF, an inter-governmental agency based in Paris, said in a statement that Myanmar had ""made progress"". This included introducing legislative measures to curb money-laundering and new regulations for its cash-based remittance system.
However, it lacked understanding of ""money-laundering risks in key areas"".
In a 2018 report, the FATF found ""Myanmar faces extremely high levels of proceeds-generating crimes"" and was ""exposed to a large number of very significant money laundering threats"".
Transnational drug syndicates have long operated in Myanmar's north and northeastern borderlands, setting up illicit drug production facilities in semi-lawless enclaves controlled by armed ethnic groups.
Myanmar's government is in peace talks with most of these groups. Some but not all have been incorporated into border guard forces allied to the military.
Arms-trafficking, illegal jade mining and unlawful logging are also big money-spinners for organized crime, the 2018 report added.
In Friday's statement, the FATF urged Myanmar to cooperate with other countries to combat the money laundering activities of global crime groups. It also pinpointed the need for Myanmar to use financial intelligence in law enforcement investigations and do a better job seizing the proceeds of crime."

Queen Elizabeth’s second son stopped carrying out royal duties last year after giving rambling and contradictory answers in an interview about his friendship with the financier Epstein, who was found dead in prison while awaiting charges of trafficking minors.
The bus drove along The Mall - the wide, ceremonial avenue leading up to the palace, the Queen's London residence - displaying the message: ""If you see this man please ask him to call the FBI to answer their questions.""
Andrew, who turned 60 this week, lives in Windsor, west of London. He denies an accusation by a woman who said she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with his friends, including the prince, when she was 17.
He said in the interview he would be prepared to give testimony under oath to investigators ""if push came to shove and the legal advice was to do so"".
But a U.S. prosecutor said last month Andrew had provided ""zero co-operation"" to the investigation into Epstein’s activities.
The bus displayed a U.S. telephone number and the web address ""gloriaallred.com"".
Allred, the lawyer representing some of Epstein's alleged victims, spoke to reporters in New York on Friday.
""If he thinks we're going away and forgetting that he has not yet spoken to the FBI, he's wrong,"" Allred said.
""His birthday was this week, 60th birthday, and I hope that he had a very happy birthday. Life is not as happy for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein. So this morning I sent him a post-birthday message on a yellow school bus that circled Buckingham Palace.""

Addressing a news conference, Hassan said the patient was taken directly to isolation from a plane arriving from the Iranian city of Qom on Thursday after exhibiting symptoms of the virus.
The patient is being quarantined at Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut and two other individuals from the Qom flight and suspected of carrying the virus would be transferred to the hospital for quarantine as well, Hassan said.
The plane, a Mahan Air flight that arrived around 7.30pm (1730 GMT) on Thursday, was carrying 125 passengers, a source at Rafic International Airport said.
A coronavirus outbreak in Iran, which has so far seen four people die, began in the Shi'ite Muslim holy city of Qom, authorities in Iran said.
An Iranian health ministry official said the likely source was Chinese workers in Qom who had recently travelled to China, where the epidemic originated.
More than 2,100 people have died in China and new research suggesting the virus is more contagious than previously thought has added to the international alarm over the outbreak.
Hassan said all necessary precautions in line with World Health Organisation advice were being followed and offered Lebanese a hotline to call if they experienced any associated symptoms.
""There is no need for excessive panic at this time... The patient is in a good state,"" said Hassan.
He said people who arrived in Lebanon on the Qom flight were asked to remain isolated in their homes for 14 days and that authorities would follow up on arrivals to Lebanon from the past ten days for potential cases."

""We broke the wall of fear a year ago. We will continue,"" the protesters chanted as they marched through the streets of the capital Algiers.
The protests broke out on Feb. 22, 2019, to reject Bouteflika's plan to seek a fifth term in office and demand the prosecution of people involved in corruption as well as political reforms.
He resigned in April last year but protests have still been held every week.
Two former prime ministers, several ex-ministers and prominent businessmen have been detained in anti-graft investigations since Bouteflika's resignation.
But demonstrators are now seeking the removal of Bouteflika allies who remain in power. They also want more steps towards democracy and better living standards.
President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has released dozens of people detained during the protests and announced plans to amend the constitution to allow a greater role for the parliament and government.
Tebboune, elected in last December in a vote largely opposed by demonstrators, on Thursday praised the protest movement and promised to meet all demands. But he warned against any attempt to infiltrate the demonstrations that could lead to violence.
He has also offered dialogue with the leaderless movement, which is known as ""hirak"", and the number of demonstrators has gone down since the election.
The political crisis adds to economic problems the authorities are facing after a fall in energy earnings, the main source of state finances, and foreign exchange reserves.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's consumer protection minister Alberto Garzon unveiled plans on Friday for a crackdown on advertising by gambling companies and casinos to address growing addiction.
The proposals are an attempt by Garzon's left-wing Unidas Podemos party to make good on its campaign promise to protect youth and gambling addicts, having formed a coalition government with the Socialist Party in January.
The gambling industry has flourished in Spain over the past decade as online gambling, sports betting and casinos have dwarfed the state-owned lottery and slot machines in pubs and restaurants.
The government aims to reduce television gambling advertising by as much as 80% and ban companies from hiring celebrities to market gambling products and services.
""The regulation has to be similar to tobacco,"" Garzon said. ""We are not regulating the textile sector here, but a sector that has an impact on public health.""
Soccer idols such as Luka Modric and Eden Hazard feature on advertisements for Spain's largest gambling company, Codere.
The new proposals also include a ban on marketing that offers the likes of free bets to new customers, which Garzon said lures vulnerable groups into gambling.
Government data shows that online betting by Spaniards has almost tripled between 2014 and 2018 to 17.8 billion euros ($19.2 billion).
The Spanish gambling lobby estimates that the nation's gamblers lose about 10 billion euros a year - equivalent to about 0.8% of Spain's GDP - through sports bets, casinos and national lottery tickets combined.
Sports betting is now so strong that almost all leading Spanish soccer clubs, including Barcelona and Real Madrid, feature gambling brands among their official sponsors. Among those with gambling companies as official shirt sponsors are Levante, partnered by Betway.
Such sponsorship, however, has come in for heavy criticism in some quarters. In 2018 Real Sociedad asked its members whether it should sign sponsorship agreements with a gambling company. Members overwhelmingly rejected the proposal.
The government, however, plans to prevent soccer clubs from selling to children jerseys emblazoned with gambling brands, but its proposals stop short of a total ban on such logos on professional teams' official kits.
The plans will need to be discussed by the cabinet before being put before parliament, though Garzon did not provide a timeframe."

MURCIA, Spain (Reuters) - Thousands of farmers took to the streets of Murcia in Southern (NYSE:SO) Spain on Friday, blocking streets with tractors and tossing vegetables to the ground in protest at low food prices and precarious working conditions.
Similar demonstrations have sprung up around the country over the last month, part of a broader pattern of agricultural discontent across the European Union.
According to Spain's UPA union, which represents small producers, average farm earnings fell by 9% in 2019 because of higher production costs and declining food prices as highly-competitive supermarket chains piled on the pressure and tariffs were imposed on some goods.
""All this is creating a climate of complete uncertainty so farmers and ranchers feel the countryside doesn't have a future,"" said Ignacio Huertas, secretary general of UPA Extremadura, who raises cattle in the area of Montijo.
European Union budget negotiations in Brussels, where agricultural subsidies have emerged as a point of contention, are exacerbating the anxiety across the sector.
More than a third of the EU's previous budget went on support to farmers, even though agriculture accounts for just 1% of its economic output, a disparity which some countries including the Netherlands have decried as unsustainable.
Agriculture Minister Luis Planas has said Spain would fight to maintain subsidies as close as possible to current levels, but acknowledged this would be hard following Britain's exit from the bloc at the end of January, which has left a 75 billion euro ($81 billion) hole in its budget.
European Council President Charles Michel last week proposed cutting the proportion of the budget dedicated to farming subsidies to 30% from 36%. Such a cut would translate into a reduction of 925 million euros a year for Spanish farmers, according to an analysis by agricultural association COAG.
In Spain, where agriculture accounts for around 2.8% of GDP, Planas has said he plans to introduce a law that would give farmers and ranchers more power in negotiations with supermarkets and large distributors.
Under the proposed law, sales contracts would be indexed to production costs, ensuring that farmers are not forced to sell at a loss, Planas told Spanish radio station Onda Cero on Thursday, adding that he hopes to propose the bill to the cabinet before the end of the month.
""The main problem is that we have no capacity to negotiate prices... We can't carry on like this,"" UPA's Huertas said."

The panel concluded, in a report published in January, that members of the security forces, among ""multiple actors"", were responsible for war crimes and serious human rights violations during a military-led crackdown against the group in 2017.
The army said in a post on its website on Friday it had studied the panel's report in great detail and was reviewing allegations.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled to neighboring Bangladesh to escape an army offensive launched in August 2017 that U.N investigators described as having been executed with genocidal intent.
The country is facing genocide charges at the International Court of Justice in the Hague, after Gambia, a mainly Muslim West African state, lodged a lawsuit last year.
Myanmar says the army was fighting a legitimate counter-insurgency campaign against militants who attacked security posts. 
The government-appointed panel blamed Rohingya militants for attacking 30 police posts and ""provoking"" the crackdown, which it said did not amount to genocide. 
The army said it was investigating alleged abuses in two villages: Maung Nu, where residents told the panel as many as 200 Muslims were killed after taking shelter in a single house, and Chut Pyin, where dozens more are alleged to have died.
""The Court of Inquiry will investigate such incidents and the trial of Court-Martial will be followed in accordance with the law and in line with the processes of Military Justice,"" the army statement said.
Two military spokesmen rejected several phone calls from Reuters on Friday seeking further comment.
'BODIES PULLED APART'
Residents of Maung Nu told government-appointed investigators that soldiers besieged the village after militants attacked a nearby security post and stormed a house where many villagers were sheltering, killing as many as 200.
In Chut Pyin, residents said soldiers surrounded the village, used rocket launchers to set fire to houses and shot indiscriminately, killing scores, according to the January report.
Troops told locals, who allegedly participated in the destruction, to ""systematically destroy the bodies"" afterwards, one Buddhist resident told the government-backed panel. 
""There were so many corpses in Chut Pyin village that when they were burnt, not all could be burnt down to ashes; some were buried, and some dead bodies were pulled apart by wild animals,"" the resident was quoted as saying.
The army said in its statement it was still reviewing other incidents mentioned in the report by the government-appointed panel, which include an alleged massacre of Hindus by Rohingya militants calling themselves the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which the group denies.
Myanmar has vowed to carry out its own investigations, saying international justice mechanisms violate its sovereignty.
The army began a trial in November of soldiers and officers from a regiment deployed to Gu Dar Pyin village, the site of another alleged massacre.
A statement on that trial will be released ""in the near future"", the military said on Friday.

Seven soldiers jailed for 10 years for killing 10 Rohingya men and boys in the village of Inn Din were granted early release last November, after serving less than a year in prison.

The group of about 20 were among 54 people from the Rohingya minority arrested on Wednesday on the outskirts of the commercial capital Yangon while trying to leave for Malaysia, according to judge Thida Aye.
""The immigration officer submitted the case because they found no identification cards from these people,"" she told Reuters. 
Some were barefoot, others clothed in colorful head-scarfs, as they were ushered into the small courtroom in Yangon. A small boy was naked from the waist down.
Defense lawyer Nay Myo Zar said they had fled Rakhine state, the western region where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya live in apartheid-like conditions and have come under increasing pressure as government troops battle ethnic rebels.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar to Bangladesh in 2017 to escape a military-led crackdown that U.N investigators have said was carried out with ""genocidal intent"" and included mass killings and rapes.
Myanmar says the army was fighting a legitimate counter-insurgency campaign against militants who attacked security posts. 
Some 600,000 Rohingya remain in the country, confined to camps and villages where they are unable to travel freely or access healthcare and education. The vast majority lack citizenship.
The government says it is working on a national strategy to close camps and that Rohingya would not face movement restrictions if they accepted a so-called national verification card, which many reject, saying it labels them foreigners.
Rakhine state has for the past year been rocked by increasingly intense clashes between government troops and fighters from the Arakan Army, an insurgent group comprised of ethnic Rakhine, another mostly Buddhist minority.
Myanmar's army said in a statement on Friday it would hold more court-martials over alleged abuses against Rohingya Muslims, after a government-appointed commission concluded soldiers committed war crimes. 
For years, Rohingya on both sides of the border have attempted to flee for Thailand and Malaysia, some boarding boats organized by smugglers, a dangerous journey that has cost many lives. 
On Thursday, 93 Rohingya arrested in November after they were found on a beach in the Irrawaddy delta region appeared in a separate court to face charges of traveling illegally, Radio Free Asia reported.

Hundreds more have been imprisoned in jails and youth detention centers across the country.

DAEGU, South Korea (Reuters) - Usually teeming with thousands of worshippers, the church at the centre of South Korea's largest coronavirus outbreak was shuttered and silent on Friday, surrounded by empty streets.
After a few minutes, a young man came out of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony in the city of Daegu and threatened to call the police if anyone tried to get in.
He was the only one there, he told Reuters - ""all of our 9,000 believers are at home."" Staff had already cleaned and disinfected the building twice this week, on Tuesday and Wednesday, he said.
The man, who declined to give his name, ventured out to stick a few 'no entry' signs on the carpark fence before retreating back into the building.
South Korea reported 100 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus on Friday, taking the national total to 204, the majority in Daegu, the country's fourth-largest city.
Most of those new cases have been traced to a 61-year-old woman who had taken part in services at the church, authorities said. Other cases were linked to a funeral in a hospital attended by several other church members.
Someone had thrown eggs at the front gate of the building, a sign of the suspicion that has simmered since the cases were reported at the church - a branch of a network of congregations, founded and still run by self-proclaimed messiah Lee Man-hee.
Nearby, residents and shopkeepers said the Daegu church was usually bustling with services several times a week. They found the silence unsettling.
""When a service was over, thousands of people in the same black suits would emerge from the exterior top floor staircase and come all the way down to the ground because they only have two elevators,"" said a 28-year-old resident who would only give his surname Seong.
""That would go on for more than 10 minutes. Really bizarre if you watch it. There are that many people.""
Authorities fear those large gatherings played a part in the spread of the virus. More than 500 members in the city were showing symptoms of the virus as of Friday, health officials said, though tests were ongoing.
Further away, most shops and restaurants on Dongseong-ro, one of the city's main shopping streets, were empty. The handful of people still out on the pavements wore facemasks. An American military base nearby was quiet, gates closed.
Seong said he drove far from his neighbourhood to get groceries or bought things online to avoid contamination.
""The mayor told people to stay home but it's difficult for many regular company employees like me whose workplaces are open as usual,"" he said. ""We do avoid going out."""
602,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2020 08:37AM ET</span>",Explainer: What's next in Thai politics after opposition party banned?,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai court on Friday dissolved a high-profile opposition political party, the Future Forward Party, ruling that it illegally took a 191.2 million baht ($6.04 million) loan from its billionaire leader.
The court also banned party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, heir to an auto parts fortune and 15 other party executive board members from politics for 10 years. The party and Thanathorn have denied any wrongdoing.
The ruling strengthened the slim parliamentary majority of the ruling coalition under former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha, who seized power from an elected government in 2014 and retained office last year when his pro-army party won elections.
WHAT HAPPENS TO FUTURE FORWARD'S LAWMAKERS?
Future Forward, which came in third in the general election last March, currently holds 76 seats of the 500 seats contested in parliament.
At least 65 Future Forward lawmakers can now join another political party or form a new party under electoral law.
But 11 seats held by the banned executives, including Thanathorn, will remain vacant until the next election. That represents a net gain for Prayuth's ruling coalition.
WILL THERE BE STREET PROTESTS?
So far, there is no sign of the kinds of mass political demonstrations by rival parties that paralyzed the Thai capital Bangkok in past decades until the latest military coup in 2014.
Thanathorn, 41, said he wanted to break with that cycle when he founded Future Forward in 2018.
Last year he also rejected the idea of protests against the election results, which Future Forward and its allied opposition parties said were manipulated in favor of Prayuth's party.
HAS THAILAND BANNED PARTIES BEFORE?
Yes. In 2007, following a 2006 military coup that ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the Constitutional Court dissolved the Thai Rak Thai party that he had founded.
In 2008, the court dissolved another pro-Thaksin political party, the People's Power Party, and two of its coalition partners that had won a post-coup election earlier that year.
Thaksin's mostly rural supporters responded by paralyzing areas of Bangkok's business district in prolonged mass protests in 2010, ending in a military crackdown in which 90 people were killed and thousands were wounded.
Ahead of last year's general election, the court dissolved Thai Raksa Chart, another Thaksin-backed party.
Future Forward is separate from but allied with the remaining pro-Thaksin opposition party in parliament, Pheu Thai, which came in second in the 2019 election.
WHAT'S NEXT?
For now, Future Forward's remaining members of parliament will work with their Pheu Thai allies and other opposition parties in parliament, Thanathorn said on Friday night.
The opposition has been planning a censure motion against Prime Minister Prayuth and key members of his cabinet and aim to at least subject them to public debate.
However, the loss of 11 Future Forward seats to the court ruling brings Prayuth's coalition majority - which at times has been as slim as one or two seats - to a relatively comfortable margin of more than a dozen votes.
Thanathorn said on Friday night he plans to start a foundation for education and a committee to campaign for political reform."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong protesters, many dressed in black and wearing surgical masks amid fears over the new coronavirus, held sit-ins in the Chinese-ruled city on Friday to mark seven months since an attack by an armed mob on anti-government demonstrators.
Protesters gathered in at least two locations, including more than 100 near the northern Yuen Long train station, in the New Territories and near the border with the mainland, where more than 100 white-shirted men beat up black-shirted activists and passers-by on July 21.
Police came in for widespread criticism at the time for not preventing the attack, and for not immediately apprehending any of the attackers when they retreated into a nearby village and were surrounded by officers.
The protesters chanted slogans on Friday including ""Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times"" and ""Hong Kong independence, the only way out!""
""We will never forget what happened on July 21,"" said Lily, a protester dressed in black, part of a group of a few dozens at the Causeway Bay metro station on Hong Kong island.
""We shouldn’t forget to resist despite the outbreak of the Wuhan pneumonia,"" she said, referring to the central city in mainland China where the coronavirus outbreak originated.
The Yuen Long violence was one of the highest-profile attacks since protests against a now-withdrawn extradition bill escalated in June last year.
The movement has since broadened to include demands for full democracy for the former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, with protesters angry at perceived Chinese meddling in the city's promised freedoms, a charge Beijing denies. Only a very tiny minority are calling for independence.
Protests have lost their intensity this year, with many people avoiding large crowds in the densely populated financial hub due to the coronavirus outbreak which has killed two of the 69 patients in the city.
But the outbreak has exacerbated anger with the city's leadership and the influence of Communist Party rulers in Beijing. In particular, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam's refusal to seal the border with mainland China, seen by many as a move to appease Beijing, has infuriated many.
Lam has said a full closure of the border would be impractical, inappropriate and discriminatory and that the government's response to the crisis was based on scientific advice and had no political considerations.
There have been sporadic weekend protests drawing hundreds since Hong Kong reported its first patient last month, demanding full closure of the border and opposing some buildings being turned into quarantine centers. These have been largely peaceful.
But protesters last month torched the ground floor of one building due to be set up as a quarantine center, forcing authorities to ditch the plan.
A Hong Kong police officer was confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus on Friday. The 48-year-old officer had attended a banquet with 59 other police in the island's Western district on Tuesday, police said.
Everyone who attended is now quarantined.
Television footage showed some protesters popping a champagne bottle to celebrate - the police became a target of protest violence last year amid accusations of brutality, a charge they deny."

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk on Friday blamed an ""information war"" being waged on the country for spreading panic and mistrust over the coronavirus, a day after the arrival of evacuees from China sparked clashes outside a sanatorium.
Speaking to parliament, Honcharuk said misinformation was being spread from within and outside Ukraine but did not elaborate.
The authorities are trying to find the source of bogus emails sent this week on behalf of the health ministry erroneously declaring there had been confirmed coronavirus cases in Ukraine, when so far there have been none.
In another example, Honcharuk cited an incident of Russian officials asking a wagon-load of passengers traveling on a train from Kiev to Moscow to disembark after a Chinese woman with fever was found to be traveling on board.
The Ukrainian railway service said it has asked Russia for more information on the case.
Police detained 24 people in clashes with residents of a town in central Ukraine on Thursday, who feared they would be infected by Ukrainians who had been evacuated from China's Hubei province to a sanatorium for a mandatory two week quarantine.
""The events that took place yesterday, in my opinion, are a consequence of, in particular, the information war that continues against our country, both from inside and out,"" Honcharuk said.
Protesters in the town of Novi Sanzhary had clashed with police, burned tires and hurled projectiles at a convoy of buses carrying the evacuees to the medical facility.
The authorities had appealed for calm, saying the evacuees were screened to make sure they were not infected before being allowed to fly. Health Minister Zoriana Skaletska announced she would join those in quarantine.
""Our health minister has agreed to stay with the citizens in this medical institution,"" Honcharuk said. ""This way her example will prove that there is no danger to Ukrainian citizens.""
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the protests had been stoked by ""political support"" but did not say from where. He appealed to Ukrainians not to vilify those returning from China.
""We constantly say that Ukraine is (a part of) Europe,"" he said. ""Yesterday, frankly, in some episodes it seemed that we are the Europe of the Middle Ages, unfortunately. Let's not forget that we are all people."""

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway has rejected Russian accusations of violating the terms of an international treaty regulating activities on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, as a diplomatic spat over Russian operations there escalated.
Russia complained earlier in February that Oslo-imposed rules were restricting activities of Russian organizations there, calling for bilateral consultations, and on Thursday accused Norway of violating the Svalbard Treaty. [L8N2A463U]
But in an email to Reuters on Friday the Norwegian foreign ministry said Norway was pursuing a consistent and predictable Svalbard policy which was fully in line with a long-agreed treaty.
Separately Norway's Defence Minister Frank Bakke-Jense told Norwegian public broadcaster NRK that Svalbard was Norwegian territory according to the treaty. ""At the same time, those who accede to the treaty must be treated equally. We do this to the highest degree,"" he said.
The latest escalation comes amid growing tensions in the Arctic between the West and Russia, both of which have been building up their military presence there as climate change opens up new shipping routes and creates opportunities to explore for natural resources.
Norway has sovereignty over Svalbard under a 100-year-old treaty but citizens of all its signatory countries, including Russia, can settle and conduct business there on an equal basis.
A Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman told a news briefing on Thursday that Norway had been ""practically violating the treaty"" in recent years, harming bilateral relations, after Oslo rejected calls for talks.
Moscow didn't question Norway's sovereignty over Svalbard, but wanted to address specific challenges, she added.
Hundreds of Russians are registered as living on Svalbard and a Russian coal mining company has for decades operated in the town of Barentsburg.
Moscow had long-term plans to strengthen and diversify its presence in Svalbard, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Norway in a letter on Feb. 3."

The court said the three men had assaulted two state rangers who pursued them in January 2019, one of whom then died from his wounds, the local news website Tengrinews.kz reported.
The court also sentenced four others to six years each for poaching saiga, a critically endangered species whose horns are used in traditional Chinese medicine. China's native saigas have been hunted to extinction, making the surviving Kazakh and Russian animals the only source.
The defendants left the badly wounded 52-year-old ranger, Yerlan Nurgaliev, and his partner alone and took the keys to their car. They denied murder charges.

Tokayev last year described Nurgaliyev as a hero and called for tougher punishments for saiga poaching.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan hopes to secure a four-month reprieve at a global meeting on anti-terrorism financing in Paris on Friday where a decision whether or not to blacklist the South Asian nation is expected, officials and analysts said.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has to date kept Pakistan off its blacklist but warned late last year that Islamabad could face international action if it failed to do more to combat terrorism financing.
But Pakistan, which has avoided punishment so far thanks to support from major ally China, now seems more confident it will keep clear of the blacklist after securing backing from other friendly countries including Malaysia and Turkey.
A minimum of three votes by FATF member states are required for a country to escape FATF blacklisting.
Pakistani Finance Ministry adviser Abdul Hafeez Shaikh has ""thanked the Chinese government for their massive support in the FATF meetings,"" a ministry statement said.
""China and other brotherly countries have supported Pakistan throughout the process in terms of guiding the country to improve its frameworks.""
Finance Ministry and counter-terrorism officials say Pakistan has done much under pressure to comply with FATF's 27-point agenda, which included an unprecedented conviction for terrorism financing of Hafiz Saeed, chief of the Pakistani Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) Islamist militant group.
""You know there are two aspects which we have to deal with at this forum. One is technical and the other political,"" a senior finance ministry official told Reuters. ""We have covered both and we expect that we will secure more concessions.""
The official said Pakistan was likely to secure another four-month grace period to fulfill the FATF agenda.
""I don't see any adverse results coming out of the meeting,"" Pakistan's former finance czar Waqar Masood told Reuters.
If blacklisted alongside Iran and North Korea, Pakistan would face a serious financial hit at a time when its economy is confronting a balance of payment crisis.
The most crucial aspect of compliance with FATF in Pakistan's case would be steps to effectively prevent militant groups from openly operating and raising funds, as the LeT has done from Islamic charities.
The FATF has pushed Pakistan to adequately identify, assess and understand risks associated with jihadist groups present in the country such as LeT, Islamic State, al Qaeda, Jamat-ud-Dawa and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM).
Pakistan has long been accused of nurturing and supporting militant groups like the LeT for use as proxies to project power in the South Asian region particularly in Afghanistan and India. Islamabad denies such accusations.
In 2018 the FATF placed Pakistan on a so-called ""gray list"" of countries with inadequate controls over terrorism financing."

ANKARA (Reuters) - Prominent Turkish philanthropist Osman Kavala, re-arrested this week hours after being acquitted over his role in nationwide 2013 protests, said on Friday President Tayyip Erdogan had intervened to prevent his release from prison.
Businessman Kavala was among nine people acquitted on Tuesday of charges related to the Gezi Park unrest seven years ago. He was then re-arrested and sent back to jail over charges related to a failed 2016 military coup.
Erdogan has repeatedly denied intervening in judicial decisions and insists the Turkish judiciary is independent.
In a statement Kavala said the Gezi acquittals had been a positive step which he had hoped would help society understand the problems of the judiciary and have a healing effect.
""However, unfortunately, the president's intervention prevented this opportunity, and I was arrested again with an allegation much more irrational and lawless than the first time,"" Kavala said.
""The allegation that I planned the coup attempt is much more irrational than the charge that I organized Gezi protests and shows a profound ulterior motive,"" he added.
A senior Turkish official, who asked not to be named, denied any interference in judicial decisions.
""The courts are pursuing their own process. After all, it was the same Turkish judiciary who made the acquittal ruling too. The process regarding Kavala is a judiciary process,"" the official said.
In the latest investigation, Kavala is accused of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order in the failed putsch of July 15, 2016, which Ankara says was perpetrated by followers of U.S.-based religious scholar Fethullah Gulen.
The 2013 Gezi Park unrest was one of the most serious challenges faced by Erdogan since his AK Party came to power in 2002. Erdogan on Wednesday described the protests as one of a series of attacks that he said culminated in the coup bid.
Erdogan has described Kavala as the local collaborator of a foreign conspiracy led by billionaire George Soros to divide Turkey by backing the Gezi protests, repeating the allegation on Wednesday, hours after Kavala was re-arrested.
Kavala is involved in publishing but his activities in the last two decades have been focused on a charitable foundation fostering cultural development and cooperation. Before that, he had businesses in telecommunication and energy.
In a ruling in December, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) said evidence was insufficient to justify the accusation that Kavala had been involved in the abortive coup."

Polls suggest the SPD will remain the biggest party in the election in the northern port of Hamburg, allowing them to continue their coalition with the resurgent Greens - set to see the biggest gains.
Campaigning in Germany's second-biggest city was suspended after a far-right shooting rampage on Wednesday night left 11 people dead in the western town of Hanau but commentators expect little direct impact on the result.
Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), in third place, may face a backlash from voters after Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer plunged her party into disarray by blowing open the race to succeed the chancellor with her decision to stand aside two weeks ago.
At least four contenders are jockeying for the CDU leadership and the party is split over how and when to make the decision. It is also unclear whether the new party chair will run as chancellor in a federal election due by Oct. 2021.
""It is possible that, in light of recent events, the SPD may gain a bit from voters who switch from the CDU,"" said Kai-Uwe Schnapp, politics professor at Hamburg University.
A Politbarometer poll for Hamburg, traditionally an SPD stronghold, on Thursday put the SPD on 39.0%, down from 45.6% in 2015 and the CDU on 12%, down about 4 points.
The Greens, on 24% in the poll, look set to roughly double their share of the vote, reflecting their national strength. Capitalizing on fears about climate change, they are second behind Merkel's conservatives at the national level.
""This would send a clear signal that the Greens can sustain the success they saw last year especially in May's elections to the European Parliament,"" said Schnapp.
Local issues, such as transport and housing, are the top issues in Hamburg, which with its famous fish market and red-light district has a reputation for being one of Germany's most tolerant cities.
This limits the appeal of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), at 6.0% in the poll, which made big gains in state elections in the former Communist East last year."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A shortage of labour and electrical power outlets in backed-up Chinese ports as a result of the coronavirus outbreak is disrupting shipments of frozen durian from Malaysia to its biggest market for the pungent fruit.
Normally bustling roadside durian stalls in Malaysia have also fallen quiet as the number of Chinese tourists, many of whom have developed a passion for the spiky fruit, has dropped off sharply since the outbreak began.
""Everybody is having a problem to clear the goods due to port congestion, it’s really hitting us,"" Ernest Lee, marketing director of Malaysia's Durian Hill exporting company, told Reuters.
Malaysia, the world's second largest durian exporter after Thailand, shipped 160.6 million ringgit ($38.61 million) worth of the fruit to China in 2018, according to government data.
China's appetite for the Southeast Asian fruit has soared in recent years, with customers paying top dollars for Malaysia's signature ""Musang King"" variety and developing a taste for durian-flavoured confectionery.
China normally accounts for about 79% of Malaysia's frozen durian exports, but trade has ground to a halt in recent weeks because of the coronavirus outbreak.
One top exporter said it expected to lose up to 15 million ringgit ($3.58 million) in the next quarter if normal shipments did not resume soon.
""Even our downstream products like durian ice cream for the summer season are not moving,"" said Anna Teo, director of exporter Hernan Corp.
""If this continues for another one or two months, it'll be a disaster.""
People seem either to love or hate the ""king of fruit"", as it is known. Durian are banned in some airports, and on public transport and in hotels in many places in Southeast Asia due to their strong smell.
But Malaysia has been encouraging large-scale farming and is predicting a 50% jump in exports by 2030 https://fr.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSKCN1NV023.
Durian stall operators in Petaling Jaya, near the capital city of Kuala Lumpur, said the number of tourists had plummeted by about 80%, with prices down by about 20% as a result.
""We can only keep fresh durians here for 36 hours. If we can't sell it, we will peel it and sell the fruit to factories that make paste and other food,"" said Cheong Tok Kong, the manger of one outlet."

Officials on Friday reported one new case in Beijing as of Feb. 20, bringing the total in the city to 396, with four dead.
Twenty-three cases were recorded the previous day.
The new cases largely stemmed from a major hospital about 6 k, (3.7 miles) west of Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ), and come as China's leaders decide whether to postpone their annual gathering of parliament, the year's most important political event, originally set for early March.
Eight health workers, nine care workers and cleaners, and 19 patients and their family members were among the 36 cases confirmed at Fuxing Hospital thus far, Pang Xinghuo, vice head of Beijing's disease control centre, told reporters on Thursday. 
The hospital only had nine cases as of Feb. 3.
""I feel deeply guilty and distressed by the cluster case incident at Fuxing Hospital,"" Li Dongxia, the hospital's director, told the same briefing.
The infections also caught the attention of the Global Times, a tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, which ran a story under the headline: ""Whopping rise in infection at Beijing hospital puts capital on alert."" 
The city's total cases now rank 13th among provincial-level jurisdictions.
To control the spread of the virus, Beijing and other cities have ordered measures including reduced opening hours at shopping malls, temperature checks in public spaces, and disinfection at residential compounds. 
Beijing also requires that people arriving from elsewhere in China quarantine at home for 14 days. Migrant workers are steadily returning to the city of more than 20 million after a long Lunar New Year break, which was extended to give authorities more time to try to contain the virus. 
""So disappointed! I was brought up in the district and thought it's the safest bastion because it's the heart of the country,"" one person wrote on the Twitter-like Weibo.

In a three-page letter to the Earl of Buchan, Washington asks the Scottish nobleman if he knew of any ""honest and orderly"" farmers who would like to emigrate to the United States to work on his land.
""My sole object is, if there are persons on the move, who may incline to associate and become tenants on such a plan as I offer, that being apprised of the measure, they may decide how far their views would be accommodated by it,"" Washington wrote.
""Nor would I wish to do it with the slovenly farmers of this country, if I had a well founded hope of obtaining this class of Men from any other (particularly from Great Britain) where husbandry is well understood, and the language similar.""
The letter was unveiled by the University of Edinburgh. It was donated to the university by Scottish polymath and antiquarian David Lang in the 1870s.
Washington, a founding father of the United States who still graces the one dollar bill, was a revolutionary war hero who played a major role in throwing off British imperial rule and then helped unite the newly independent nation as its first leader.
The letter of 1796 shows Washington was planning for life after his presidency which would end the following year. After abandoning tobacco crops in the 1760s, he focused on wheat and gives possible terms for tenants.
""I set it at a bushel and half for every acre contained in the lease,"" he wrote.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - The lobster catchers of South Africa's Western Cape have become an unexpected casualty of the coronavirus after China halted imports of the West Coast rock lobster last month as part of measures to contain the outbreak.
""I am stuck now because they are putting our catches aside now, the factory doesn't want to take our fish, there is no market for our fish,"" said Lorraine Brown, 60, as she waited for the day's catch to arrive at Witsand's slipway, used by the Ocean View fishing community, some 40 km from Cape Town.
""We don't know where we stand. They say you can catch, but your crayfish must stand in the water. For how long are they going to keep it in the tanks, and what money are we going to benefit if the crayfish must all die?"" she told Reuters.
Before China halted seafood imports on Jan. 25, Brown could earn 340 rand ($22) per kg for live exported lobster. The price has now slipped to 120 rand per kg on the local market, too little to make ends meet, she said.
First detected in China, the coronavirus epidemic has killed more than 2,000 people and infected tens of thousands more as its pernicious tentacles disrupt global aviation, shipping trade and tourism sectors.
China has halted live animal trade over fears the trade could help spread the disease.
South Africa, which has no confirmed coronavirus case, has been hit hard by the suspension of lobster exports to China - which last year bought 95% of its total allowable west coast lobster catch of 1,084 tonnes.
The West Coast Rock Lobster Association, which represents offshore and near-shore rights holders, said the outbreak has had a ""serious impact"" with direct financial losses to rights holders estimated in excess of 257 million rand ($17 million).
""But, then there is the secondary effect on the people working the factories processing less lobster, the people catching it will be taking out less fish ... so our fishing communities will have less money,"" said the association's chairwoman, Shamera Daniels.
There were almost 50 tonnes of live crayfish at risk of dying, being frozen and sold at a significant discount, she said.
The industry was in discussion with the government about possible interventions, Daniels said, such as extending the fishing season should China's trade restrictions persist.
Ocean View's fishermen said their survival was at stake.
""We are basically the worst off because of the coronavirus,"" said fisherman Charles America. ""The effects might be economic or financial in the upper echelons of the industry, but down on the ground here it is survival, pure survival."""

""Comedians should run for office. We already have a bunch of clowns!"" he tells the crowd at Kez's Kitchen before riffing about whether Kenya's politicians are on drugs.
He said when his mother notices his red eyes from smoking cannabis: ""I told her I'm not high - I'm presidential!""
Onjoro is the face of the capital's booming comedy scene - he co-founded the Nairobi Comedy Club three years ago to mentor other aspiring comics.
So far, they have got 10 experienced comics on the books, and 10 junior ones. They organize open mic nights and held Nairobi's first comedy festival in December.
Comedians from Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania came to swap jokes and tips. Anyone is welcome.
""I'm not going to tell you you are not funny. Just go there and grab a mic and just you know, death by fire,"" Onjoro told Reuters.
It is not easy. This Saturday, Nairobi restaurant Kez's Kitchen was packed with customers expecting a night of live comedy. But three of his five supporting acts showed up too late to perform.
George Waweru opened with a crack about the recently deceased former president Daniel arap Moi, known for presiding over vast corruption and the torture of political opponents.
""They say the good die young,"" Waweru tells the crowd. ""Moi was 95. You do the math.""
Comedian Maina Murumba wryly references their struggle to hit the big time. Comedy does not pay - fees are low and equipment costs are high.
""By the year 2056, the world will be completely cashless,"" he says, to laughter. ""Not to brag, but I've been completely cashless since 1992.""
Then Onjoro, a bundle of nervous energy, is up. He must extend his set to fill the gaps but he is already stretched: comedy is a niche night out in Nairobi so many of the audience are regulars. Comics must constantly refresh and rehearse their material to avoid repeating jokes.
Some jokes meet mixed reactions. Onjoro likes to dance over the line of acceptability - he is not so much poking at taboos as reaching for the gelignite.
Punchlines about HIV, skin tone or sex in a wheelchair provoke with both groans and uncertain laughs from the well-heeled and politically savvy crowd. A table of women at the front roll their eyes when he jokes about stabbing a female missionary.
But the audience roars at a routine playing on foreigners' outdated stereotypes.
He mimics a foreign reporter breathlessly narrating his own cannibalization by famine victims, then Onjoro - a scriptwriter with a shock of short dreadlocks - tells how he seduced a visitor from London by impersonating a tribal warrior over Skype.
""By the time she took her bra off, I was a Zulu!"" he yells.
The crowd loves it."

PARIS (Reuters) - A global dirty money watchdog is likely to place Iran on its blacklist on Friday after it failed to comply with international anti-terrorism financing norms, a move that would further isolate the country from financial markets, two diplomats said.
The decision comes after more than three years of warnings from the Paris-based Financial Action Taskforce (FATF) urging Tehran to enact terrorist financing conventions or it would see its suspension from the blacklist lifted and some counter-measures applied.
It will mean more scrutiny of transactions with Iran, tougher external auditing of financing firms operating in the country and add pressure on the few banks and businesses still operating with Iran.
""It will be placed on the blacklist today,"" said a Western diplomat. ""The consequence of (Iran's) inaction is higher costs of borrowing and isolation from the financial system.""
A second diplomat also said Iran would be placed on the list.
However, the two diplomats and a third European official, who did not confirm Tehran would be placed on the blacklist, said countries would be called to implement counter-measures relevant to their economies, leaving them with a choice on what to implement.
""It's a middle solution. A sort of a fudge to leave the door open for the Iranians,"" said one the diplomats.
Foreign businesses say Iran's compliance with FATF rules is key if Tehran wants to attract investors, especially since the United States re-imposed sanctions on Iran in 2018 after withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and other world powers.
Washington has since pushed a policy of ""maximum pressure"", saying a broader deal should be negotiated on nuclear issues, Iran's missile program and Iranian activities in the Middle East.
France, Britain and Germany have tried to salvage the deal, but have faced growing pressure from the United States to join its efforts against Iran.
""The United States was pushing for the toughest position, while other countries like China and Russia preferred something more flexible,"" said a European official. ""The Europeans were looking for something in between.""
U.S. sanctions have crippled Iran's economy, slashing its oil exports and increasingly isolating it from the international financial system.
Iran's leaders have been divided over complying with the FATF. Supporters say it could ease foreign trade with Europe and Asia when the country's economy is targeted by U.S. penalties aimed at its isolation.
Hardline opponents argue that passing legislation toward joining the FATF could hamper Iran's support for its allies, including Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Iran's action plan to meet with the FATF requirements, implemented in 2016, expired in January 2018.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif this week appeared resigned to the FATF blacklisting, accusing the United States using its maximum pressure campaign to exert influence at the FATF."

China adjusted its methodology on Wednesday to count only cases that are detected with genetic tests, rather than with CT scans. Officials concluded on Friday that it was a mistake to have removed cases that were already counted.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - The leaders of Ireland's Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, two of the three largest parties to emerge from a Feb. 8 election, will meet early next week for what they described as exploratory talks as negotiations to form a government step up.
Fianna Fail's Micheal Martin has begun seeking to form a coalition government but has ruled out governing with Sinn Fein, the left wing pro-Irish unity party which surged at the poll and has an equal number of seats in the fractured parliament.
That means some kind of government agreement will be needed with acting prime minister Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael and at least one other party. Fine Gael won 35 seats in the 160-seat house to the 37 each held by Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein.
All sides predict it will take several weeks to form a government with the risk of a second election if talks fail, meaning Ireland will be represented by a caretaker government in the initial stages of post-Brexit trade talks.
Historical rivals, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have swapped power at every election since emerging from the opposing sides of Ireland's 1920s civil war. They have never formed a coalition together but facilitated one another in a minority government deal last time around.
Varadkar's spokesman said on Friday that the meeting would be exploratory in nature as the Fine Gael leader only has permission from his party to engage on that basis and would need a further mandate to open negotiations on a policy program.
Varadkar reiterated this week that Fine Gael was preparing for opposition but that the party would be willing to help form a government if all other options are exhausted.
Fianna Fail will also open formal talks next Wednesday with the smaller Green Party, whose 12 deputies would be enough to hand any combination of two of the three biggest parties a majority.
Any hope Sinn Fein had of Martin changing his mind on the party appeared to be extinguished late on Thursday when the Fianna Fail leader launched a strong criticism in parliament of Sinn Fein's roles as the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army.
Martin said Sinn Fein did not operate to the same democratic standards held to by every other party and that its leader Mary Lou McDonald had praised units of the IRA.
McDonald, who took over from Gerry Adams in 2018 and has no direct link to the IRA's role in the three decades of violence in Northern Ireland that ended in 1998, rejected the statement and said Martin was ""exuding bile."""

“Parasite” became the first foreign-language film to win best picture in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards on Feb 9. It won a total of four Oscars, including best director and original screenplay for Director Bong Joon-ho and best international feature film.
""A masterpiece that has artfully and sharply cut through the reality of a handful of loan sharks living well while ruling over an overwhelming majority, who they consider as dogs or pigs, has been recognised as No. 1 in the U.S.- and Caucasian-centric film industry,"" the Japan-based Choson Sinbo newspaper said.
The film is a tale of two South Korean families - the wealthy Parks and the poor Kims - that mirrors the deepening disparities in Asia’s fourth-largest economy and has struck a chord with global audiences.
In June 2019, less than a month after ""Parasite"" began showing in South Korea, North Korean propaganda website DPRK Today had said that the movie was ""making people realise again that the capitalist system is a rotten, sick society with a malignant tumor of rich-becoming-richer and poor-becoming-poorer, a society with no hope or future."""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's Constitutional Court on Friday dissolved an upstart opposition political party that has challenged the military establishment, finding it guilty of taking an illegal loan from its billionaire founder.
The dissolution of the Future Forward Party comes less than a year after Thailand held a general election to end five years of military rule and it strengthens the position in parliament of a coalition led by Prime Minister Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the former junta leader who took power in a 2014 coup.
Future Forward, led by charismatic auto-parts fortune heir Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, 41, has been sharply critical of military dominance of politics. It surprised many by coming third in the elections last year, winning the support of many young people and 81 of the 500 seats contested in parliament.
The court ruled that the party broke the law by taking a 191.2 million baht ($6.08 million) loan from Thanathorn. 
""The party is ordered to be dissolve according to the 2017 political party law,"" Constitutional Court Judge Panya Utchachon said in his ruling.
The court also banned Thanathorn and 15 other party executives from politics for 10 years.
Most of the rest of the party's lawmakers will retain their seats and can form a new party, but the ban on its leaders will reduce the opposition's votes and its ability to block Prayuth's agenda.
Prayuth's pro-army party came first in the election but opposition parties say the electoral laws written by the junta were designed to give the military establishment control over politics and to keep Prayuth in power.
Last month, the Constitutional Court rejected accusations the Future Forward Party sought to overthrow the monarchy, an allegation that could have seen it banned.
The court on Friday said the loan to the party amounted to a donation because it did not follow commercial practices in lending. The election law limits donations from an individual to 10 million baht ($318,167). 
The party and Thanathorn have denied any wrongdoing. Thanathorn said the financial arrangements between himself and the party were above board.
""If we could turn back time ... we would do the same thing because it was transparent and verifiable,"" he said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post this week.
Late last year, Thanathorn was suspended from parliament by another court ruling that found he breached election law after he was accused of holding shares in a media company when he registered as a candidate. He said he sold the shares before registering.

While Future Forward and its allies say the political system has been engineered to ensure rule by Prayuth's pro-army party, he says a constitution drawn up during military rule, which enshrines a political role for the military, is necessary to ensure stability after years of chaos and occasional violence.

Thabane was due in court at 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) over the death of Lipolelo Thabane, who was shot dead in June 2017 near her home in the capital Maseru two days before he took office.
But by 11 a.m., Thabane was not at the court.
""I'm still trying to confirm his whereabouts and whether or not he will show up. We don't know,"" Deputy Police Commissioner Paseka Mokete said.
Thabane's current wife, Maesaiah Thabane, has already been charged with ordering Lipolelo's murder but is currently out on bail. Police said on Thursday that the prime minister would also be charged with murder.
The love triangle murder case has stunned the southern African kingdom, a mountainous state of 2 million people encircled by South Africa with a long history of political instability.
Reuters could not reach Thabane's office for comment.
The prime minister told local radio on Thursday that he would step down at the end of July, but he did not mention his wife's death and cited old age instead.

KABUL/PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Afghan, international and Taliban forces will observe a seven-day period of reduced violence in Afghanistan beginning at midnight (1930 GMT), an Afghan official and Taliban leaders said on Friday.
The agreement was struck during protracted negotiations between U.S. and Taliban representatives that began in Qatar in 2018, and could lead to a withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, they said.
""Based on the plan, the reduction in violence (RIV) will start between the Taliban and international and Afghan security forces for one week,"" Javid Faisal, spokesperson for the Afghan National Security Advisor, told Reuters.
""We hope it is extended for a longer time and opens the way for a ceasefire and intra-Afghan talks,"" he added.
Three senior Taliban leaders - two in Doha and one in Afghanistan - also confirmed to Reuters that they had agreed on reduction of violence in Afghanistan for seven days starting Friday night.
All three spoke on condition of anonymity. The Taliban is expected to make a formal announcement of the RIV later on Friday. 
One Taliban leader based in Doha told Reuters that the period could not be called a ""ceasefire.""
""Every party has the right of self defense but there would no attacks on each other’s positions in these seven days,” the Taliban leader said. 
“It is to create a security environment in Afghanistan and can be extended if things go well after signing of a peace accord with the U.S.,” he added.
Officials privy to the talks had said last week that an agreement with the Taliban would be followed by negotiations on an intra-Afghan political settlement between the Taliban and an Afghan delegation that would include government officials.
The Taliban have previously refused to speak directly to the Kabul government, which they denounce as a U.S. puppet.
Afghan forces will keep up normal military operations against other terrorist groups, such Daesh, or Islamic State, during the RIV period, Faisal said, adding that Afghan forces will also retaliate to the smallest violation of the understanding by the Taliban.
""Local government and security officials have been instructed by the president himself on how to follow the regulations agreed upon for the RIV period,"" he said. 
U.S. officials were not immediately available for comment. 
U.S. and Taliban negotiators have been meeting in Doha since 2018 even though fighting has raged in Afghanistan and thousands of civilians and combatants have been killed as the insurgents have expanded their territorial control.

MUKONO, Uganda/YAOUNDE, Cameroon (Reuters) - When Margaret Ntale Namusisi's three daughters called her in Uganda to say they were being quarantined at their university in Wuhan, China, because of the coronavirus outbreak, she sent money and told them: ""Run very fast and do shopping.""
Valeria, Veronica and Vivian did just that. But nearly one month on, with no help from their government, they are now under lockdown in a crowded apartment with orders to stay indoors with the windows closed. Food, funds and morale are running low. 
""They are traumatized,"" said Namusisi, who wakes up at 3 a.m. every day to talk to her daughters over the Chinese messaging service WeChat. ""They ask, has Uganda given up on us?"" 
Countries across the world have flown their nationals home from China's quarantined Hubei province, the center of the outbreak of the virus that since January has infected more than 74,000 people and killed over 2,100. 
But no sub-Saharan African country has done so, leaving thousands stranded.
""We've gone to parliament, we've gone to the ministry of health, we've gone to the ministry of foreign affairs and taken them our petition to bring back our children,"" said Namusisi, nearing tears. 
Reuters spoke to families from Cameroon, Uganda, Senegal and Ethiopia with similar tales of frustration. Many have set up associations to pressure their governments to act, through letters and petitions. 
Governments across Africa have said they plan to send money to students to help with expenses. Cameroon said it was sending about $82,000 to help its citizens stuck in Hubei.
However, many including Senegal and Uganda, say they do not have the resources to look after coronavirus patients at home and their nationals would be safer in China where authorities have reported a dramatic drop in new cases in Hubei.
But while Uganda said last week that it would send $61,000 to students stuck in Wuhan, the Namusisi sisters have received nothing so far. 
They survive on one meal a day of noodles or rice, their mother said. Other foods are now too expensive: one kilo of beef costs $13, one tomato a dollar. 
They are not alone. Dagmawi Demelash Mengistu, a business student from Ethiopia, said his school has provided latex gloves and masks, but his government has not responded to students' calls to be flown home. 
He too is locked inside, short of food and money.
""We have seen one plane come for four students in Wuhan to evacuate them, just one plane,"" said Mengistu who is part of a student association that has asked the Ethiopian embassy to fly them home. 
""Ethiopian airlines haven't stopped flights from China ... so that is a shot to the gut when you see they are still continuing flights but cannot take their citizens out.""
Ethiopian authorities did not respond to requests for comment.
A LIGHTING STRIKE
Many African nations are nervous about a little-known virus breaching their borders. 
Ebola killed over 11,000 people in West Africa between 2013 and 2016. An ongoing outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo has killed over 2,300.
Health officials say those epidemics have prepared countries to keep coronavirus from spreading and the World Health Organization says 24 African nations can test for potential cases. Airport screening and monitoring procedures have already highlighted possible coronavirus cases across the continent. 
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention last week called on governments to bring Africans home. But this has provided little comfort for those stranded in China or their families back home who have received little or no communication from their governments. 
Roger-Michel Kemkuining, a Cameroonian, found out that his student son Pavel had contracted coronavirus from a statement posted online by Yangzte University, where Pavel was studying.
The statement, seen by Reuters, said the university had informed the Cameroonian embassy and the parents, but that was news to Kemkuining. 
Cameroon's health ministry spokesman, Clavere Nken, confirmed that the family had found out via social media. He said he had since spoken to them by phone. Yangzte University did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Pavel is the only known African to test positive for coronavirus. He has recovered and was released from hospital on Feb. 10 but remains in isolation, he told Reuters. 
For his father, the situation still rankles. 

Seeing the statement was ""like a lightning strike,"" he told Reuters at his home in Yaounde. ""I was really dejected.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Almost a decade after his WikiLeaks website enraged Washington by leaking secret U.S. documents, a London court will begin hearings on Monday to decide whether Julian Assange should be extradited to the United States. 
A hero to admirers who say he has exposed abuses of power, Assange is cast by critics as a dangerous enemy of the state who has undermined Western security. He says the extradition is politically motivated by those embarrassed by his revelations.
The 48-year-old is wanted by the United States on 18 criminal counts of conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law and could spend decades in prison if convicted.
Now, some 10 months after he was dragged from London's Ecuadorean embassy where he had been holed up for seven years, Judge Vanessa Baraitser will hear arguments as to why he should or should not be sent to the United States. 
Jennifer Robinson, Assange's lawyer, says his case could lead to criminalising activities crucial to investigative journalists and his work has shed an unprecedented light on how the United States conducted its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
""We are talking about collateral murder, evidence of war crimes,"" she said. ""They are a remarkable resource for those of us seeking to hold governments to account for abuses."" 
WikiLeaks angered Washington by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic cables that laid bare critical U.S. appraisals of world leaders, from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family.
Assange made international headlines in 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache (NYSE:APA) helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff.
PARDON DEAL?
The hearing at London's Woolwich Crown Court will not decide if Assange is guilty of any wrongdoing, but whether the extradition request meets the requirements set out under a 2003 UK-U.S. treaty, which critics say is stacked in favor of the United States.
Baraitser has agreed that the case will get under way next week before being postponed until May 18 when it will resume again for a further three weeks to allow both sides more time to gather evidence.
Assange's lawyers have said in preliminary hearings that they would argue he was being sought for political offences and that the treaty banned extradition on these grounds. 
Trump offered to pardon Assange if he said that Russia had nothing to do with WikiLeaks’ publication of Democratic Party emails in 2016, his lawyer told a London court this week. The White House dismissed the accusation.
Other arguments would feature medical evidence, public denunciations by leading U.S. political figures and details from the case of Chelsea Manning, an ex-intelligence analyst who was convicted by a U.S. Army court-martial in 2013 of espionage and other offences for leaking secret cables to WikiLeaks.
Assange's legal team are planning to call up to 21 witnesses as part of his defense. 
In 2012, Assange took refuge in Ecuador’s London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden where he was accused of sex crimes which he denied and which were later dropped, saying he feared he would ultimately be sent on to the United Sates.
After seven years, he was dragged from the embassy in 2019 and then jailed for 50 weeks for skipping bail. He has remained in prison ever since, after the United States launched its extradition request. 

If the judge decides Assange should be extradited, the decision needs to be rubber-stamped by Home Secretary (interior minister) Priti Patel although he will have the right to appeal to London's High Court and then possibly to the Supreme Court, Britain's top judicial body.

Qatar's foreign ministry said in a post on its official Twitter account that Saudi Arabia had only granted an entry permit to Public Health Minister Hanan al-Kuwari after the meeting at the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) General Secretariat on Wednesday had already started.
""We are surprised to see that Saudi is politicizing a humanitarian sector, that requires close collaboration and coordination due to the urgency of the situation,"" the English-language statement issued on Thursday said.
The secretariat and Saudi Arabia's government media office did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and non-GCC Egypt have imposed a political, economic and trade boycott on Qatar since mid-2017 over allegations it supports terrorism and is cozying up to regional foe Iran. Doha denies the charges and says the embargo aims to curtail its sovereignty.
The first glimmer of a thaw had appeared late last year when Saudi Arabia and Qatar began talks over the dispute, but Qatar's foreign minister said last week the discussions did not succeed and were suspended at the start of January.
Kuwait and the United States, which has strong ties with all the states involved, have tried unsuccessfully so far to mediate in the row to restore Gulf unity. Washington sees the rift as a threat to efforts to contain Iran.
There have been nine confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in the UAE, which is a major international air transport center and regional tourism and business hub. Most of the people infected have been Chinese nationals.
The epidemic originated in China and has killed more than 2,100 people there. New research suggesting the virus is more contagious than previously thought has added to the international alarm over the outbreak."

The base in the regional town of Katherine in Australia's Northern Territory will be the home of the country's new fleet of F-35 strike fighters once the upgrade is finished in 2027.
The development would also be used by U.S. troops, of whom there are 1,250 stationed in Australia's north.
""It will be integral to our alliance with the United States, and [will] increase the reach of Air Force capabilities in the Indo-Pacific,"" Morrison said in a statement.
Speaking to reporters in Katherine, Morrison denied the redevelopment was aimed at China, though it comes amid a souring of bilateral relations.
Australia has historically enjoyed virtually unchecked influence in the Pacific, but its influence in the region has been challenged in recent years by China, which has significantly expanded its financial aid to the region.

China denies attempting to use its financial assistance to gain leverage, but Australia remains anxious that Beijing could seek a military presence in the region.

BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - An independent investigation requested by Brazilian iron ore miner Vale SA into the causes of the Brumadinho tailings dam disaster that killed 270 people a year ago found the company knew about the problem but failed to deal with it.
An executive summary of the report published by Vale on Thursday said the company had information dating as far back as 2003 that pointed to the fragility of the main B1 dam.
But steps taken to deal with the structural problem and heighten the dam's security were limited and ineffective, the report said.
The Brumadinho dam burst in January 2019 in Minas Gerais state, unleashing an avalanche of muddy mining waste which killed an estimated 270 people, burying many of them alive.
The internal report serves as a damning condemnation of the firm, some of its employees and various auditors. While concerns were raised at various points in time about the dam's safety, those concerns were repeatedly ignored or minimized over the course of 16 years. 
In January, state prosecutors charged Fabio Schvartsman, the chief executive at the time of the burst, with homicide. A Brazilian state judge last week accepted the charges.
The investigating team concluded that the dam burst was due to structural instability caused by liquefaction, citing among other factors inadequate drainage of the reservoir and a dam that was not designed to contain liquefied material.
Among their recommendations, mostly referring to improved operating procedures, the investigators said the company should evaluate the potential risks at other similar dam structures.
Vale said in a securities filing that it has already addressed most of the issues mentioned in the recommendations with numerous steps to improve its internal controls. 
The company said it will announce a timetable for implementing all the those actions within 30 days.
The report said that studies in 2016 had determined the dam was in ""fragile"" condition, and subsequent 2017 studies determined its state was ""barely marginal.""
However, Vale's geo-technical division, ""resisted when it came to accepting the results of the 2017 study,"" the report said.
The report added that in July 2016, then-Director of Coal and Ferrous Metals Peter Poppinga ordered that tailings cease to be deposited at the B1 dam reservoir, ""possibly as a result of security concerns relating to B1.""
Poppinga could not immediately be reached on Thursday evening.
The move by a judge in Brazil's mining heartland of Minas Gerais follows charges filed by state prosecutors on Jan. 21 accusing the former CEO and other 15 people of homicide. 
The report on Brumadinho was announced hours after Vale reported quarterly results that showed the company was still reeling from the disaster despite managing to limit the apparent effects of the dam burst on output.
In a securities filing, the company reported a $1.56 billion net loss in the fourth quarter.

Vale severely missed quarterly profit and margin estimates largely due to impairments related to its base metal and coal operations and the lingering effects of the dam burst.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 09:37PM ET</span>","Australian university offers Chinese students $1,000 to return via third country","By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - One of Australia's leading universities said on Friday it is offering Chinese students A$1,500 ($992) if they travel through a third country as higher education providers seek to minimize the impact of a ban on foreigners arriving from mainland China.
Australia has since Feb. 1 barred entry to foreigners arriving directly from mainland China, citing a need to stop the spread of the flu-like virus that emerged in China late last year.
The ban was extended on Thursday until at least Feb. 29.
With the Australian academic year already underway, universities fear thousands of students will withdraw and look at international alternatives if they are unable to get to their classes within weeks.
Australia's government has said that as long as the students are outside China for 14 days, they would be permitted to enter the country.
Western Sydney University said it will offer Chinese students a one-off payment if they fulfill those requirements.
""Our students are keen to travel to Australia and start the new academic year as soon as possible,"" said a Western Sydney University spokeswoman in an emailed statement.
""In recognition of the additional costs incurred in traveling via another country, the University has offered to assist students with a one-off A$1,500 subsidy payment.""
Foreign students are worth about A$35 billion a year to the Australian economy, with Chinese students accounting for about a third of that figure.
Australia's largest eight universities, which have 105,000 Chinese students between them, said last week the coronavirus travel ban would cost the economy more than A$1 billion, and put at risk 7,500 jobs for each 10% fall in Chinese students.
Qantas Airways chief executive Alan Joyce said on Thursday it has been approached by Australian universities to ensure it can provide enough flights for returning Chinese students once restrictions are lifted.
With the restrictions weighing on the Australian economy, Prime Minister Scott Morrison is under pressure to ease the restrictions.
Local media on Friday reported the government had discussed allowing some Chinese students from outside Wuhan to enter.
A spokesman for Morrison declined to comment. The prime minister on Friday said his government was working on easing the burden but it would not be through direct funding to universities.
""We are working on some projects with the education sector... but lets not forget our universities are well capitalized,"" Morrison told reporters."

The victims, who included two 15-year-old boys, were mostly from two provinces in north-central Vietnam, where poor job prospects, encouragement by authorities, smuggling gangs and environmental issues have fueled migration. 
Seven defendants, including a Vietnamese woman living in China, were charged with creating immigration profiles for 67 people from different areas in Vietnam for illegal work in Britain and Europe, Ha Tinh province regional police said in a statement.
Police referred to the case of 26-year-old Pham Thi Tra My, who was one of the victims of the British truck deaths.
""They contacted the victim in late June, 2019 and charged her $22,000 to create immigration profiles,"" the statement said. ""The victim in September was then taken to China, France and the UK."" 
The truck deaths shone a spotlight on the illicit trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West.
Police said in the statement that their investigation was continuing and would be expanded. They did not give details on any court appearance by those charged.
British police last week arrested two more people over the deaths.

Autopsies concluded that the provisional cause of death of the 39 people was a combination of hypoxia - oxygen deprivation - and hyperthermia - overheating - in an enclosed space.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's electoral body said on Thursday that former president Evo Morales was ineligible to run for a senate position in a May election re-run of a voided vote late last year that sparked a political crisis and led to the leftist leader's resignation.
Salvador Romero, the head of the country's electoral tribunal, told reporters that Morales did not meet the requirements to be a Senate candidate for his Movement for Socialism (MAS) party, which is currently leading in the polls.
Morales stepped down in November after the disputed Oct. 20 election sparked widespread protests and led to allies and security forces pulling their support for the long-standing leader who led the country for almost 14 years.
The former president, now in exile in Argentina, is orchestrating his party's election campaign ahead of the May 3 vote, with his former economy minister Luis Arce at the top of the ticket. Morales had been eyeing a Senate role.
The landlocked South American nation, which is grappling with economic slowdown, was plunged into political crisis last year over allegations of electoral fraud after Morales won an election handing him a fourth term in defiance of term limits.
Morales' party is now facing a fragmented opposition, including current caretaker President Jeanine Anez, who took over in a political vacuum after his resignation last year."

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A 28-year-old man who murdered a British woman backpacker in New Zealand was handed life imprisonment with a minimum of 17 years behind bars, one of the longest sentences given in a country where serious crime was once considered rare.
The murder of 22-year-old Grace Millane, from Essex, shocked New Zealanders and raised questions about the country's reputation as a safe, easy-going holiday destination. 
Millane went missing in Auckland on Dec. 1, 2018, while on a backpacking tour through New Zealand after finishing university.
She met the convicted killer through dating app Tinder. Both shared drinks on the eve of her 22nd birthday, the day she went missing, and later went to his downtown Auckland apartment.
Police found her body several days later in a shallow grave in a bushland just a few meters from a scenic drive in hills west of the city.
The man, whose name still remains suppressed by the court order, was found guilty of the murder by a jury on Nov. 22.
Justice Simon Moore opted for a non-parole period of 17 years, one of the longest stretches ever handed down to a murderer in New Zealand, 1NEWS said.
The judge said this was not a case where the strangulation was driven by rage or was premeditated. 
But Millane was vulnerable and appeared to be restrained.
""You were in a position of total physical dominance,"" the judge told the killer, according to New Zealand Herald newspaper.
NATION SHOCKED
The man confessed Millane died in his apartment but pleaded not guilty to murder, and his lawyers argued she died accidentally during consensual sex. 
But prosecutors said the accused had murderous intent and Millane was strangled to death. 
Justice Moore said in the minutes after her death the man looked up pornography sites and then took intimate photos of Millane's body, noting these were not the actions of a man in panic.
The man then transported Millane's body out of his apartment in a suitcase and later buried it.
Earlier in the day, Millane's mother Gillian read a statement in court via a video link from the UK. The news that her daughter was found in a shallow grave would ""haunt"" her for the rest of her life, she said, according to the Herald.
Gillian said the killer had ""taken my daughter's future"" and robbed her family of so many memories, the newspaper reported.
Thousands of people held candlelight vigils after Millane's death in a national outpouring of grief. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern held back tears as she apologized to Millane's family on behalf of New Zealand.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tibetans mark the 80th anniversary of the enthronement of their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, on Saturday.
Ahead of the celebrations, here are ten facts about Tibet's spiritual leader:
1. Born in 1935 as Lhamo Thondup, the current Dalai Lama was proclaimed as the reincarnation of his predecessor at the age of two, when he is said to have identified several of his possessions.
2. After a three-month journey from his home village he was enthroned on Feb. 22, 1940, at a ceremony in Lhasa, capital of the autonomous Tibet region that is now part of China.
3. China invaded Tibet in 1950. The teenage Dalai Lama assumed a political role shortly after, traveling to Beijing to meet Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders.
4. After a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule, the Dalai Lama fled to India in early 1959. He went into exile in the northern hill town of Dharamshala, where he still lives.
5. Since his flight from Tibet, China has accused the leader of being a dangerous separatist, and said any attempt to meet him is a ""major offense"". In 2012, Beijing canceled a planned visit by then-British Prime Minister David Cameron after he hosted the Dalai Lama in London.
6. The Dalai Lama wakes at 3am and meditates for several hours, according to a sample of his diary on his official website. After a breakfast of porridge and tsampa, a traditional barley flour, he spends the morning reading Buddhist texts, before holding audiences in the afternoon. He retires by 7pm.
7. His interests include cosmology, neurobiology, quantum physics and psychology, he told Reuters in an interview last year.
8. He has been granted dozens of honorary doctorates and awards for his leadership of the Tibetan community, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.
9. The fourteenth Dalai Lama has said the decision whether to retain the role after his death will be made by the Tibetan people, not the Chinese government, which claims the right to choose his successor. ""If the majority of (Tibetan people) really want to keep this institution, then this institution will remain,"" he told Reuters.
10. Despite his veneration by Tibetans - and mistrust from China - the Dalai Lama says he spends most of his time on spiritual activities, not political affairs. ""I always consider myself as a simple Buddhist monk,"" he said on his official website. ""I feel that is the real me."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York jurors weighing rape and sexual assault charges against former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein ended their third day of deliberations by asking on Thursday to review testimony from actress Annabella Sciorra.
Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting former production assistant, Mimi Haleyi in 2006, and raping Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress, in 2013.
Sciorra, best known for her role in HBO's ""The Sopranos,"" testified that Weinstein came to her New York apartment one winter night in 1993 or 1994, raped her and then forced oral sex on her.
The accusation is too old to be charged as a separate crime, but serves as an aggravating factor for the most serious charge in the case, predatory sexual assault.
Jurors can convict Weinstein of predatory sexual assault, which carries a potential life sentence, if they find that he committed the assault against Sciorra and at least one of the alleged crimes against Haleyi or Mann.
The seven men and five women on the jury began deliberations in the case on Tuesday. 
On Thursday, before finishing for the day, they asked to review Sciorra's cross-examination and follow-up questioning by prosecutors.
Justice James Burke told them the testimony would be read to them on Friday morning.

Since 2017, more than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct, fueling the #MeToo movement. Weinstein, whose films include ""The English Patient"" and ""Shakespeare in Love,"" has denied the allegations and said any sexual encounters were consensual.

WASHINGTON/LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - A debate-stage scrap between Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren spilled onto the Democratic campaign trail on Thursday as the former New York mayor sought to move past his rocky debate debut and the senator dug in on attacking her billionaire rival.
There are just two days to go before the presidential caucuses in Nevada. Afterward, contests loom in South Carolina, followed by Super Tuesday on March 3, when voters cast ballots in 14 states, including California, Utah, Colorado and Texas.
The blistering criticism of Bloomberg on Wednesday night - over his record on race, history of sexist comments and use of his fortune to push his way up in opinion polls - could damage his argument that he has the best chance of beating Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election.
Bloomberg, who entered the race late and will not be on primary ballots until Super Tuesday, has tried to position himself as a moderate alternative to Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who has risen to front-runner status in opinion polls. Bloomberg spent $220.6 million on his candidacy in January and $409 million to date.
Bloomberg's campaign moved to stem the fallout early on Thursday by announcing endorsements from members of Congress from New York, New Jersey and California, after saying on Wednesday night he was ""just warming up."" 
In a nod to Warren's charge that Democrats nominating Bloomberg to challenge Trump would be exchanging ""one arrogant billionaire for another,"" he told a rally in Utah: ""We could not be more different; I bill myself as the un-Trump.""
""Look, the real winner in the debate last night was Donald Trump,"" Bloomberg added.
Warren, who landed early jabs during the debate related to Bloomberg's use of nondisclosure agreements for women at his company to settle lawsuits and his support while mayor of stop-and-frisk policing policies that ensnared disproportionate numbers of blacks and Latinos, remained on the offensive.
""I have really had it with billionaires ... who think their money buys them something special, so they can call women 'fat broads' and 'horse-faced lesbians,' that when somebody complains, throw a little money on it, and then put a gag in a woman's mouth,"" Warren said while campaigning in North Las Vegas.
Bloomberg said at the debate there were ""very few"" nondisclosure agreements and ""none of them accuse me of anything."" He said they were made ""consensually"" with the expectation they would stay private.
RISING STAKES
Wednesday's was the most-watched of the nine Democratic presidential debates so far this cycle, with about 20 million tuning in on NBC and MSNBC and 13.5 million on streaming platforms, the networks said.
For Warren, it was an opportunity to try to steady her campaign after disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire. Her campaign said on Thursday afternoon it set fundraising records by bringing in $425,000 during the first hour of the debate, and $5 million in total since she walked onto the debate stage.
Democratic strategist Ian Sams, who worked on Senator Kamala Harris' former presidential campaign, said Warren's performance showed she ""will not be going quietly into the night"" and the money will keep her competitive through Super Tuesday. 
Sanders, whose campaign said it raised a record $2.7 million on Wednesday, also faced some incoming fire on Wednesday night. But the debate did not settle the question of which moderate candidate is best-suited to take him on, strategists said.
""When you are the front-runner, and no one does anything to stop you, it's a good night,"" said Tad Devine, a former adviser to Sanders, who worked on the now-shuttered Andrew Yang campaign.
It ""raises the stakes enormously,"" however, for Bloomberg, who is blanketing states with advertisements but has yet to show he can engage directly with voters and the media, Devine said.
Pete Buttigieg's campaign warned in a strategy memo early on Thursday that Sanders must be stopped before he amasses an ""insurmountable delegate lead,"" arguing that Bloomberg's performance showed he was ill-equipped to do so.
Initial results from the Iowa caucuses, the nation's first nominating contest, gave Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a one-delegate lead over Sanders. The two rivals won an equal number of delegates from the second contest in New Hampshire, although Sanders got more votes overall. 
Nevada's caucuses will be the third contest in the state-by-state race to find a challenger to Trump. South Carolina holds its primary on Feb. 29. Sanders leads most recent opinion polls in both states.

Buttigieg had a town hall meeting and a fundraiser scheduled for Thursday in Los Angeles. Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden, a onetime front-runner, campaigned in Nevada and will participate in CNN town halls. Senator Amy Klobuchar is in Colorado.

Tebboune also praised the ongoing protest movement for avoiding violence which he said could have led to a ""disaster"" for the North African country.
The comments by Tebboune, elected in December in a vote largely rejected by protesters, came a day before the demonstrators were due to celebrate the first anniversary of weekly protests that forced veteran President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to resign in April.
""Beware of infiltration. There are signs of infiltration,"" Tebboune said on state television, without elaborating.
Mass protests, known as Hirak, broke out on Feb. 22 of last year to demand the cancellation of a plan by the ailing Bouteflika to seek a fifth term, the prosecution of people involved in corruption as well as other political reforms.
Two former prime ministers, several ex-ministers and prominent businessmen have been in detention since then as part of anti-graft investigations.
The military was the main player in Algeria's politics after Bouteflika's departure until the handover of power to Tebboune in December.
""I have decided to decree Feb. 22 national day of fraternity and cohesion between the people and their army for democracy,"" Tebboune said.
""Hirak is a healthy phenomenon,"" he said. ""It saved the country from disaster.""
Tebboune has released several protesters who had been detained over the past weeks and set up a commission to amend the constitution with the aim of giving the parliament and government a greater role.
But the leaderless protest movement is demanding the release of more detainees, deeper reforms and the departure of remaining symbols of the Bouteflika era.
""We will solve all problems, God willing,"" Tebboune said."

Relations between London and Washington have been strained by Britain's decision to allow the Chinese telecoms company Huawei [HWT.UL] a limited role in its mobile network, a proposed British digital services tax and the Iran nuclear deal.
Johnson had been expected to visit Washington early this year but The Sun newspaper reported last week that the trip had been postponed until June when a summit of leaders of the Group of Seven rich nations is due to take place in the United States.
""The Prime Minister and President Trump spoke this evening and discussed a range of bilateral and international issues,"" Downing Street said in a statement on Thursday.
""The leaders reiterated their commitment to the UK-U.S. relationship and looked forward to seeing each other at the G7 Summit in the United States in June.""

Britain wants to strike a trade deal with the United States as part of its plan for a more global role after its departure from the European Union, something Trump has said he wants too.

U.S. President Donald Trump included Nigeria and five other countries in an expanded version of his travel ban list early this month, sparking outrage from many of them.
U.S. officials have said the six countries failed to meet U.S. security and information-sharing standards, necessitating the new restrictions.
Nigeria's interior minister, Ogbeni Aregbesola, made the request to drop the ban to the U.S. ambassador in Abuja, the ministry said in a statement.
""Nigeria is too important an ally of America to deserve such a sanction,"" Aregbesola said, according to the statement.
""We are positive that (the) visa restriction is a temporary one, it will soon be put behind us,"" he said, adding that Nigeria had complied with most of the concerns raised by the United States.
The statement did not say how U.S. Ambassador Mary Beth Leonard responded to the request, but it said she assured Aregbesola of ""her country's determination to continue to collaborate with Nigeria"".
Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is the biggest country on the list whose citizens will be suspended from U.S. visas that can lead to permanent residency.  
The original travel ban, issued in 2017, barred nearly all immigrants and travelers from seven countries with majority Muslim populations.
The policy was revised amid court challenges, but the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately upheld it in 2018.   "

BERLIN (Reuters) - A man accused of mounting one of post-war Germany's worst racist attacks was described on Thursday as an inconspicuous trained bank clerk who gave few public signs of the views he was quietly recording in a 24-page manifesto.
The 43-year-old German - identified by prosecutors as Tobias R. - is suspected of gunning down nine people in two shisha bars in the town of late on Wednesday, before turning the gun on himself and his elderly mother.
Authorities said they had found a document on his home page filled with ""obscure thoughts and absurd conspiracy theories"" that ""pointed to deeply racist views"".
Reuters has not seen the manifesto but German media printed some of the text which called for the destruction of people across the Middle East, northern Africa and Asia.
""In some parts it is very confused, there are many conspiracy theories articulated,"" Bild newspaper cited terrorism expert Peter Neumann as saying.
Those words and theories did not fit with the man that Claus Schmidt thought he knew.
""He was totally inconspicuous. There was not a hint of racism or hatred toward foreigners, not even an awkward joke. He was always friendly,"" said 50-year-old Schmidt, who runs the SV Diana Bergen-Enkheim shooting club that Tobias R. joined.
""We have several club members with foreign roots and there was never a problem,” Schmidt told Reuters by telephone.
Schmidt said Tobias R. had lived and worked in Munich but came back to the area last year after his job ended. Tobias R. practiced at the gun club twice or three times a week and had said he wanted to go to the United States.
Alongside the manifesto, prosecutors said the home page also linked to at least one YouTube video, posted within the last week.
The video, which Reuters saw before it was removed, shows a middle-aged white man with a receding hairline, smartly dressed in a white open-necked shirt and dark jacket.
He addresses Americans in fluent, if accented, English, warning them that their country is under the control of ""invisible secret societies"".
There was no mention of race and it had not been enough to flag him up to authorities.
""At the moment there is no information about previous convictions against him or investigations with a political background,"" the public prosecutor said in a statement.
Tobias R.'s home page, which has also now been removed, also showed an interest in America - the main page displayed a picture of a bald-headed eagle.
But the rest was focused on his curriculum vitae - from high school in Hanau, to his training as a bank clerk in Frankfurt to his business administration certificate, secured in 2007."

AZAZ, Syria/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish forces and Syrian rebels fought government troops in northwest Syria on Thursday and Russian warplanes struck back in a sharp escalation of an intense battle over the last rebel bastions, Russian and Turkish officials said.
The Turkish Defense Ministry said two of its soldiers were killed and five were wounded in Syrian government air strikes in Idlib, bringing Turkish military fatalities to 15 this month in the Idlib region. It said more than 50 Syrian soldiers had been killed in retaliation. 
Earlier, talks between Moscow and Ankara, who back different sides in Syria's nine-year war, had failed to reach a compromise to ease the situation and head off a direct confrontation between them in Aleppo and Idlib provinces.
Syrian troops backed by Russian forces have been battling since December to eradicate the last rebel strongholds in the region in a war that has killed an estimated 400,000 Syrians and left much of the country in ruins.
In Geneva, the U.N. refugee chief called for a halt to the fighting to allow hundreds of thousands of trapped and destitute civilians to move to places of safety.
There was no end was in sight to the misery of the nearly 1 million people - most of them women and children - who have fled the fighting to seek sanctuary in the border area.
Families are sleeping outside by roads and in olive groves, burning garbage to stay warm. Some children have died from the cold. Some families have at least reached tent camps for displaced people.
""We want the whole world to see us and learn about our conditions, the children and these camps,"" said Ruqyyah Omar, a woman who left Idlib and is now at a camp near Azaz, about 30 km (20 miles) northwest of Aleppo city. 
Thursday's action came a day after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan threatened a military operation against the Syrian government forces unless they pulled back from rebel-held areas.
The Russian Defense Ministry said Turkey provided artillery support to the militants, wounding four Syrian soldiers.
Russian warplanes then attacked the militants who had burst through the government positions in two areas of Idlib, allowing the Syrian army to repel them, the ministry said.
""So as not to allow the armed groups to make it deep into Syrian territory, Russian Su-25 aircraft carried out a strike ... on the armed militant groups that burst through,"" it said.
Ankara said Syrian planes had carried out the air strikes.
Speaking in an interview recorded early on Thursday, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar told CNN Turk that Ankara and Moscow were discussing the use of Syrian air space in Idlib. He said problems could be overcome if Russia ""steps aside"".
Turkey has urged its Western allies to provide ""concrete support"" in Idlib and Akar said that Washington could send its Patriot missile systems to Turkey to bolster its security.
""There are air missile threats against our country and there are previous events of the sort. In that light, there could be a Patriot system battery support here,"" Akar said.
UNDER FIRE
A rebel source told Reuters the Turkish army and rebels had mounted a joint operation to storm the town of Nairab, push the army away from the M4 highway, and relieve the encirclement of five Turkish observation posts on the outskirts of the crossroads town of Saraqeb.
Turkish forces engaged Syrian troops on Saraqeb's southern edge, he said.
""The strategic goal is to reach Saraqeb city because it lies on both key highways,"" Ibrahim al Idlibi, a former rebel official and activist said. ""The Turkish troops are now combing Nairab town after the Syrian forces had pulled away"".
Turkish and Russian officials have failed to reach any compromise in talks, although Turkish officials had sounded more optimistic on Thursday prior to the flare-up on the ground.
Various options are being discussed, including possible joint patrols in Idlib, a Turkish official said. Both Ankara and Moscow expected their presidents to ""end the issue"", he added.
Akar said Turkey would not accept any Russian proposals to move its observation posts in Idlib, but added that talks with Moscow had not reached an impasse.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whose family dynasty has ruled for nearly half a century, has showed no sign of letting up in the campaign to crush his foes.
Residents and relief staff said Russian warplanes on Thursday resumed attacks on the towns of Darat Izza and Atareb in the northern corner of Aleppo province, where Turkish troops have set up a line of defense.
The exodus of people has overwhelmed relief agencies but Turkey, struggling to cope with 3.7 million Syrian refugees inside its borders, says it can take no more.
In Azaz, Abu Abdallah had been stranded on the road for days. After his family fled air strikes pounding Idlib, they have yet to find refuge. With him were his wife, four children and 20 relatives.
""I don't know where to take them,"" the 49-year-old farmer said, sitting on his tractor. ""God knows where we will go."" 
French President Emmanuel Macron called on the U.N. Security Council and European Union to take action.
""Today, and for several weeks now, one of the worst humanitarian dramas has been unfolding,"" Macron told reporters as he arrived at an EU summit in Brussels.
The U.N. humanitarian affairs agency OCHA said the crisis had reached a horrifying level, with displaced people crammed into a small pocket of Idlib.
""Places previously considered safe by civilians are now coming under fire,"" it said in a report.

More than 300 people, many of them women and children, had been killed in Idlib and Aleppo due to the hostilities since the start of the year, it said.

A witness said around 100 worshippers were in the mosque hall at the time of the attack and that roughly 20 people jumped on the assailant.
""I heard screaming,"" said the witness, who declined to give his full name, ""and then we saw the blood.""
He said the victim was stabbed on top of his shoulder by a man who had been attending the mosque for about six months before Thursday's incident. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was deeply saddened to hear of the attack. 

""It's so awful that this should happen, especially in a place of worship. My thoughts are with the victim and all those affected,"" Johnson said on Twitter.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>","Disillusionment among women, youth seen dampening Iran election turnout","By Babak Dehghanpisheh and Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Middle-aged men have been plastered on campaign posters and online adverts this week ahead of Iran's parliamentary election, even though women and young people make up the majority of voters.
Roughly a third of Iran's electorate is between 18 and 30 and 49.9% of voters are women, according to official figures. Both groups have, in the past, been strong supporters of candidates they believed might ease restrictions on social life.
But disillusionment among pro-reform voters over what they see as the failure of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani to bolster personal freedoms may keep some at home on Friday.
""I voted in the past because I thought it would bring a little more freedom. It was a very different time,"" said one Tehran resident who manages a food company, who declined to be named. She said she did not plan to vote.
Turnout is seen as a critical test of the popularity of the clerical establishment. About 62% of eligible voters took part in the 2016 parliamentary election and 66% in 2012. 
It is expected to be around 50% on Friday, according to a spokesman for the Guardian Council, the body responsible for vetting election candidates, despite Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's instruction to all Iranians this week that voting is ""a religious duty"". 
After pragmatists were largely barred from the parliamentary field in favor of hardliners, the election has shaped up as a referendum on the Shi'ite clerical elite's handling of the Islamic Republic's political and economic crises.
That has pushed to the sidelines questions of social reform, such as ending laws that impose fines and jail terms for women if their hair is not fully covered, or for wearing clothes deemed immodest.
In recent years, thousands of women have posted videos and photos of themselves taking off their headscarves (hijab) in public as part of an online campaign. 
""I want to vote, this is my duty as a citizen. But I will vote in a free election. This is not a free election,"" Setareh, 19, said from the northwestern city of Tabriz, declining to give her surname.
Mehrnoush, 23, an unemployed woman in the capital Tehran, said: ""Why should I even bother to vote when the result will change nothing?""
A statement by a dozen female detainees at Evin prison, some of whom campaigned against the hijab law, has been posted on social media calling for an election boycott - echoing a call by some pro-reform politicians in Iran and rights activists abroad.
One video circulating on social media this week showed a young man ripping up election posters.
MAKING ENDS MEET
Voters will select 290 lawmakers in Iran's first election since President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers in 2018.
It will test sentiment about the Iranian leadership and its handling of crises, including the killing of hundreds of anti-government protesters by security forces in November and a near-brush with war with the United States after the killing of an Iranian general in a U.S. air strike in Iraq last month.
Another major grievance for women and young Iranians is an economic downturn which has left many scrambling to make ends meet, exacerbated by U.S. sanctions.
The unemployment rate for Iranians aged 18-35 is 17.9% but for women in that age range it is 29.3%, according to official figures published by the Statistical Center of Iran in December. 
The International Monetary Fund projected that the economy would shrink by 9.5% in 2019, with growth seen flat in 2020. Inflation exceeded 38% last year.
Even without the difficulties brought about by sanctions, many Iranians blame mismanagement and corruption for the country's economic dysfunction.

""The system is corrupt. My vote will make them remain in power. No vote,"" said Afshin, 25, a student in Tehran.

The clashes were the worst since the country's military council and a coalition of opposition parties agreed on a power-sharing deal last August, protesters said.
At least 17 people were wounded in the clashes, a doctors' committee linked to the opposition said in a statement.
Many of the wounded were hit by teargas canisters, the committee said, while witnesses said they saw others being chased off by security forces who beat them with batons.
The doctor's committee said one of those injured had suffered a gunshot wound and another had a rubber bullet wound. There were no other immediate reports of shots being fired.
The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which called the protest and was also a key member of the opposition coalition that struck the deal with the military, called for the minister of the interior and the police general director to be sacked.
It urged Prime Minister Abdulla Hamdok in a statement to ""immediately dismiss the interior minister, the police general director and the head of police in Khartoum and replace them with national elements who belong to the revolution.""
The SPA said in a statement earlier in the day that all soldiers and military officers who had been ""arbitrarily excluded from military service"" should be reinstated.
The military removed Bashir from office and arrested him last April after months of demonstrations, bringing an end to his 30 years of autocratic rule.
But dozens of protesters were killed during crackdowns on the demonstrations, and dozens more died last June when security forces cleared a sit-in at which protesters pushed for further reforms.
Among those dismissed last week were some young army officers who had refused to participate in the crackdown on demonstrations in front of the defense ministry calling for the removal of Bashir.
""Whoever protected and sided with the people's revolution deserves to be celebrated, promoted and given a leadership position,"" the SPA said in its statement."

The bronze crown is thought to be one of just 20 of its kind in existence. It has depictions of the Christian Holy Trinity as well as Jesus Christ’s disciples.
An adviser to the prime minister said he believed the crown had disappeared from the Holy Trinity Church in Cheleqot, in Tigray, North Ethiopia, and that it belonged to the government.
Sirak Asfaw, an Ethiopian refugee, found the crown hidden in a case belonging to someone who had transited through his apartment in Rotterdam, the state-affiliated Fana news agency said.
He realized it had been stolen but kept the discovery a secret until he was confident that it could safely be returned to Ethiopia. It was not immediately clear what happened to his transiting visitor.
""Today Ethiopia receives a precious crown stolen several years ago and taken to the Netherlands. I am grateful to Sirak Asfaw and the Netherlands government for facilitating its return,"" Abiy said in a tweet.
According to Ethiopian authorities, the crown had been missing since 1993.
The artifact was handed over by Sigrid Kaag, the Dutch minister for foreign trade and development cooperation, to the Ethiopian government in Addis Ababa.
Kaag said in a tweet on Thursday she was ""delighted"" to see the piece returned."
656,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 01:13PM ET</span>","Spain to overhaul sexual assault law, strengthen victims' rights","MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's government is poised to toughen legislation against sexual violence to bolster victim rights and improve the state's response to such crimes, government sources said on Thursday.
Calls to reform the relevant section of the penal code have been growing in the wake of a string of high-profile trials, including the so-called ""Wolf Pack"" case in which an 18-year old girl was gang-raped during Pamplona's annual bull-running festival.
The main change proposed by the new law would be to classify all non-consensual sex as rape, according to a report by Spanish news website eldiario.es, which cited a draft of the proposed bill. 
Government sources reached by Reuters and speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the accuracy of the eldiario.es report but insisted the text is only a draft.
Aggravating factors such as physical violence or the use of drugs or alcohol to incapacitate the victim would carry heavier sentences, while such cases would be heard by special judges in courts dedicated to sexual crimes, as is already the case with crimes relating to gender violence.
Under Spain's current laws, the perpetrator must have used physical violence or intimidation for an assault to be classified as rape.
The law will also include procedures to tackle sexual harassment in the workplace and measures aimed at preventing sex crimes and raising awareness, the government sources said.
Several cases have captured public attention since the landmark Wolf Pack ruling in which the Supreme Court found five men who attacked the teenager guilty of rape, overturning a previous verdict of sexual abuse. 
Protests erupted in November after a court in Barcelona cleared five men of raping a 14-year-old girl and jailed them for the lesser charge of sexual abuse. A month later three former soccer players were handed hefty sentences in the northern city of Burgos for raping a minor.
Spain's new left-wing coalition government has made bolstering women's rights a priority, while the World Economic Forum ranks the country eighth globally for gender parity.

With the new legislation the government also aims to improve research and reporting on all forms of sexual violence.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican will on March 2 open up its archives on the wartime pontificate of Pius XII to allow scholars to probe accusations that he turned a blind eye to the Holocaust, but they will find he helped Jews behind the scenes, Holy See officials say.
""I don't think you will find a smoking gun,"" Father Norbert Hofmann, the top Vatican official in charge of religious relations with Jews, told Reuters in an interview in his office.
Jews have for many years been seeking transparency from the Vatican on its actions during the Holocaust, and the order from Pope Francis to open the archives will allow historians and other scholars to peruse them for the next few years.
Some Jews have long accused Pius, who reigned from 1939 to 1958, of doing little to help those facing persecution by Nazi Germany and failing to speak out forcefully against the Holocaust, in which around six million Jews were killed.
The Vatican says Pius worked quietly to save Jews and thereby not worsen the situation for many others at risk, including Catholics in parts of Nazi-occupied Europe.
When Francis announced the opening of the archives last year, he said the Church was ""not afraid of history"", a theme repeated on Thursday at a presentation for reporters by Vatican archivists. 
Bishop Sergio Pagano, prefect of the Vatican's Apostolic Archives, said documents from the World War Two period contain millions of pages divided into 121 sections divided by topics.
The consulting area in the archives offices can accommodate 60 scholars at a time and all the space has been booked for the rest of the year, Pagano said. The scholars include some from the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.
""We will not pass judgment for now. We will leave that to scholars. The material is there. It is diversified,"" Pagano said.
""We will leave each person to draw their own conclusions but we have no fear. The good (that Pius did) was so great that it will dwarf the few shadows,"" he said.
OPEN MIND
David Kertzer, a Brown University professor who has written several books about the papacy and the Jews, said scholars were indebted to the Vatican for making the archives available but one had to keep an open mind about what might be found in them. 
""It's true that one should not be thinking in terms of 'scoops' and serious scholars need to have a larger picture in mind than looking at a single document,"" said Kertzer, who will be one of the first scholars to view the archives. 
""But clearly there's nervousness in the Vatican and among proponents of Pius XII, and the push to make him a saint, about what might come out of these archives,"" he told Reuters.
""Pius saw his job as protecting the institutional Church and everything else was secondary."" 
Pope Francis has said Pius' legacy has been treated with ""some prejudice and exaggeration"". 
Two weeks ago he recalled in a message to Rome officials that many convents and churches in the Italian capital hid Jews from the Nazis during the German occupation.
""Pius XII was a diplomat and he was a very shy character and a very, very cautious man,"" Hofmann, who is German, said in the interview. ""And under the circumstances of the occupation it would have been difficult to shout out loudly."" 

Asked about the Church's position that Pius did what he could under the wartime circumstances, Pagano said: ""The new documents will further corroborate and reinforce this.""

LISBON (Reuters) - Hundreds of Portuguese, old and young, protested outside parliament on Thursday against proposed bills that would legalize euthanasia as lawmakers geared up for a fierce debate on the issue that is likely to be approved in a house vote. 
""I think life is an inviolable asset, human life has an inviolable value, consecrated by our Portuguese constitution - thank God,"" 21-year-old anti-euthanasia protester Francisco Guimaraes told Reuters. 
""We must care for life until it comes to its natural end."" 
Inside parliament, lawmakers will debate through the afternoon and vote on bills proposed by five political parties, including the ruling Socialists, to allow euthanasia and assisted suicide in certain cases and under strict rules.
Euthanasia involves a physician taking an active role in ending a patient's life whereas in assisted suicide the doctor provides a lethal substance for the patient to self-administer. Both practices are allowed in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium. 
Given Portugal's current parliamentary composition, at least one of the bills to legalize the practice is likely to be approved but the legislative process may take time and encounter a few bumps along the road. 
If approved in general terms, the bill will be discussed in detail in parliament's constitutional affairs committee that can amend it. 
Portugal's right-wing CDS-PP party and the Catholic Church want to call a referendum on the issue if the bill is approved. 
Under Portuguese law, referendums can be requested by parliamentary groups, the government or groups of citizens. The request is evaluated by a court but the final stamp of approval is given by the country's president.
President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, a conservative himself, could also veto the euthanasia bill and send it back to parliament. 
The five proposals are fairly similar, with all parties agreeing only those over 18 who do not suffer from a mental illness can request the practice if they are terminally ill, suffering from ""unbearable"" pain and ""without a hope for cure"". 

Those against the legalization of euthanasia and assisted suicide have repeatedly argued Portugal should instead prioritize health care provided to the terminally ill.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's hard-left unions on Thursday brought workers back onto the streets in protest against President Emmanuel Macron's pension reform, but numbers were low as the fight to derail the project shifted to parliament.
Lawmakers began debating the biggest overhaul to the pension system since World War Two this week in the National Assembly, where 41,000 amendments to the draft bill have been filed, more than half of them by the far-left France Insoumise party.
Macron's ruling party says the amendments are a deliberate bid to stall the bill's passage through parliament, and some Macron loyalists say it increases the likelihood the government will have to force the bill through by decree.
The unions have been locked in battle with Macron over the fate of France's generous pension benefits since early December. The former investment banker has made some concessions to the unions in the face of long transport strikes but refuses to abandon his reform.
The government insists the reform must result in a balanced pension budget by 2027 and has proposed increasing the retirement age for a full pension to 64, a move even moderate unions reject. 
Talks between unions, employers and the government to find an alternative way to balance the budget are taking place in parallel to the parliamentary debate, but with two weeks left to find a deal, there is little sign of a breakthrough.
""We made a concrete proposal for funding pensions through higher salaries and a revision of exemptions to employers' contributions,"" said Philippe Martinez, leader of the militant CGT union, ahead of the street protest.
Macron has diluted his ambitions for streamlining the existing set-up of 42 different pension schemes, each with their own level of benefits, into a single system that gives every pensioner the same rights for each euro contributed.
The president says the existing schemes deter job mobility and that reform is central to his drive to create a more flexible labor market.
The government was seriously looking at ramming the legislation through by decree, one cabinet minister said, a move some analysts say could reignite public anger. The minister, who requested anonymity, played down the risk.
""The protests are far from huge, the strike has run out of steam. Support for the reform is not all that low,"" he said.
On Thursday, lawmakers spent three hours debating two of the 41,000 amendments.

Asked about the prospect of government using the path of forceful adoption, Roland Lescure, a senior parliamentarian for Macron's ruling LREM party, said: ""Unfortunately, it is likely.""

President Edgar Lungu last week ordered soldiers to join the police in patrolling the streets after the attacks, which have sparked public outrage.
The attacks began in December and were initially confined to the mineral-rich copperbelt but have since spread to the capital Lusaka. Police are still trying to pinpoint the exact number of victims.
Britain and the United States have issued travel alerts to their citizens following the attacks.
""We have formally arrested 16 persons and among them one of them is actually purported to be funding these operations,"" deputy police spokesman Rae Hamoonga told Reuters.

Sky reported Johnson was looking at overhauling five business councils set up in November 2018 by his predecessor Theresa May and that the existing structure was likely to be axed.
Johnson has met the co-chairs of the business councils, who include  Tesco  (L:TSCO) boss Dave Lewis, BAE Systems (L:BAES) Chairman Roger Carr and GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) Chief Executive Emma Walmsley, only once since he took office in July. That meeting was in October.
Johnson's Conservatives won a large parliamentary majority in a general election two months ago and Sky reported there had been no attempt to reactivate the business councils since then.
""The prime minister and his business team are refreshing how best to engage with businesses to ensure Britain is the number one country in the world to start, grow and run a business,"" a spokeswoman for Johnson's office said.
""The prime minister remains committed to closely working with industry and future plans will be set out in due course.""
The councils cover sectors ranging from financial and professional services to consumer, retail and life sciences and were chaired by senior business leaders.
They were intended to meet three times a year to provide advice and policy recommendations on critical issues impacting business, particularly how to create the best business conditions in Britain after it left the European Union.
At the time of their creation, the government said the members would hold membership for a year.
Despite being seen as pro-business while Mayor of London, when he championed financial services, Johnson's record has been clouded by his reported ""fuck business"" comment in 2018 in dismissal of companies' concerns about Britain's EU exit.
Media have reported relations between Johnson's office and key business lobby groups such as the Confederation of British Industry, have become increasingly strained since the election over his team's view that they have been too negative about Brexit."

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Chinese diplomat on Thursday backed Pakistan's decision not to evacuate Pakistani students from the province at the centre of China’s coronavirus outbreak, a day after parents confronted government ministers demanding their children be brought home.
Pakistan has ruled out bringing back more than 1,000 students in Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, where three-quarters of the more than 2,000 deaths from the outbreak of the flu-like virus have been recorded.
“If such large number of students come back, this will cost huge health operations for the Pakistani government. If the isolation facilities are not ready, this can cause another outbreak of this virus in Pakistan,” Li Bijian, Consul General of China in Karachi, told reporters.
“So that’s why I say this decision of not evacuating the students from the epicentre is difficult but a very good decision.”
On Wednesday, angry parents confronted government ministers at a meeting, demanding their children be evacuated.
Li said China had better facilities for the students and the government was providing masks and suits to protect them.
“We treat them as our own children,” Li said.
Pakistan and China are very close allies. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday called Chinese President Xi Jinping to express Pakistan's solidarity with the Chinese leadership and people, a statement issued by the prime minister's office said."

VIENTIANE/BANGKOK (Reuters) - China on Thursday said it was helping its downstream neighbors cope with a prolonged drought by releasing more water from its dams on the Mekong River, adding it would consider sharing information on hydrology to provide further assistance in the future.
The statement came as a new economic report predicted that the building of dams to harness hydropower on the Mekong River would reshape the economies of five countries along the waterway, fuelling long-term inflation and dependence on China.
The drought over the past year has severely hurt farming and fishing in Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam, and many blame China's 11 dams on the upper Mekong - which China calls the Lancang River - as well as climate change.
Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said a lack of rain was the main cause of the drought and said China had suffered from it too.
""China has overcome its own difficulty and increased water outflow from the Lancang River to help Mekong countries mitigate the drought,"" Wang told a meeting of the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) grouping.
""We also agreed to strengthen such cooperation within the framework of LMC to ensure the rational and sustainable use of water resources,"" he said.
A new spate of dam-building in Laos is poised to turbo-charge water and food security disputes along the Mekong, on which at least 60 million people depend for their livelihoods.
In the past four months, Laos has opened two dams on the mainstream Lower Mekong and is poised to begin construction later this year on a third dam near the city of Luang Prabang.
On Thursday, an analysis by Fitch Solutions Macro Research said dam-building was already changing livelihoods and would have profound implications in the coming decade.
The report cited studies by the Mekong River Commission that projected heavy losses in fishing and farming, which would force these countries to import more food.
""This puts these countries at further risk of elevated inﬂation due to higher foreign food prices in times of shortage, and currency depreciation over the long term due to likely higher structural inflation vis-à-vis their trading partners,"" it said.
""This could see these economies increasingly rely on China for essential food imports to make up the shortfall over the long term, making these countries even more vulnerable to Chinese influence,"" the report said.
It also predicted a shift away from agriculture towards manufacturing and hospitality services such as tourism.
Fitch Solutions is an economic research center owned by the Fitch Group that operates separately from the Fitch Ratings agency.

668,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 10:01AM ET</span>","Extraditing Assange would hit press freedom, rights advocate tells UK","LONDON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange should not be extradited to the United States because it would have a chilling effect on press freedom, a European human rights chief said on Thursday.
Assange, 48, is in prison in London, where an extradition hearing begins next week. The U.S. authorities want to try him on 18 counts including conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law.
Dunja Mijatovic, the Council of Europe's Human Rights Commissioner, said Assange's case raised questions about the protection of people who publish classified information in the public interest, exposing human rights violations.
""The broad and vague nature of the allegations against Julian Assange, and of the offences listed in the indictment, are troubling as many of them concern activities at the core of investigative journalism in Europe and beyond,"" she said.
""Consequently, allowing Julian Assange’s extradition on this basis would have a chilling effect on media freedom, and could ultimately hamper the press in performing its task as purveyor of information and public watchdog in democratic societies.""
Mijatovic said she was also concerned about detention conditions in the United States and about the sentence likely to be imposed on Assange. He could spend decades in prison if convicted.
The Council of Europe, which describes itself as the continent's leading human rights organization, has 47 member states including Britain, all of which are signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights.
Assange's WikiLeaks website made global headlines in early 2010 when it published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 helicopter attack in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff.
Since then, the website has published a vast amount of secret U.S. diplomatic cables and other confidential documents.
Assange presents himself as a champion of free speech holding a superpower to account, but critics accuse him of irresponsibly putting lives at risk with his unedited information dumps.
After WikiLeaks published leaked emails during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign that damaged Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, he was accused of complicity in Russian efforts to meddle in U.S. politics and undermine the West."

The Irish Coast Guard said there was nobody on board when it ran aground. The U.S. Coast Guard had rescued 10 crew members in September 2018, since when the vessel had been drifting after being abandoned off Bermuda.
Footage released by the Irish Coast Guard shows it grounded on rocks near the village of Ballycotton in County Cork on Sunday.
The ship had been en route from Greece to Haiti when it ran into difficulties and had been drifting for almost 20 days when the crew radioed for help and were rescued about 2,220 km southeast of Bermuda, the Irish Times reported.
Authorities are seeking to establish ownership of the wreck. Ireland's Revenue Commissioners said they had been contacted by an individual purporting to represent the owner.
Cork County Council has asked the public to stay away from the wreck as it is located on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coast and is in an unstable condition."

Netanyahu's announcement, during an election campaign in which he has sought to shore up support from pro-settlement voters, was condemned by the Palestinians as another blow to their hopes for an independent state.
He has pledged to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and the area's Jordan Valley as part of an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan presented by U.S. President Donald Trump last month. Palestinians have rejected Trump's blueprint as biased towards Israel.
Opponents of the project, in the Givat Hamatos area adjacent to the Palestinian neighborhood of Beit Safafa, said it would sever parts of East Jerusalem from the nearby Palestinian town of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank.
Construction of 2,610 housing units for Jews in Givat Hamatos was approved by a Jerusalem planning committee in 2014. The Israeli government effectively put the project on hold after the United States and the European Union criticized the plan.
Visiting an area overlooking the Israeli settlement of Har Homa on the outskirts of Jerusalem on Thursday, Netanyahu said in a video he posted on social media: ""Today I approved the construction in Givat Hamatos"" of 3,000 homes for Jews, of which 1,000 would be marketed soon.
He said some 1,000 housing units would be built for Arabs in Beit Safafa. No construction date was announced for either area.
In a separate project, Netanyahu said another 2,200 housing units would be built in Har Homa, located like Givat Hamatos in an area of the West Bank that Israel annexed to Jerusalem after the area's capture in the 1967 Middle East war.
""Netanyahu's insistence on building thousands of settlement units is the systematic destruction of the two-state solution and the implementation of the Trump plan,"" Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said after the Israeli leader's announcement.
Palestinians and much of the world view Israel's settlements in areas seized in the 1967 conflict as illegal under international law, but the United States and Israel dispute this.

HANOI/LANG SON (Reuters) - Vietnam has eased restrictions on cross-border trade with China to prop up economic activities hit by the new coronavirus, the Ministry of Industry and Trade said on Thursday. 
China is Vietnam's largest trading partner and the Southeast Asian country's manufacturing sector relies on it for materials and equipment. China is also Vietnam's key market for farm produce.
Vietnam early this month stopped issuing visas for Chinese tourists and partially closed the borders to prevent the spread of the virus that has killed more than 2,100 people in China.
Authorities in the northern province of Lang Son on Thursday reopened Tan Thanh border, one of the main borders between the two countries, to facilitate goods flows, the ministry said in a statement posted on its website. 
At the nearby Huu Nghi border, hundreds of trucks were seen on Thursday preparing to transport goods to China after being stuck since Feb. 5, according to Reuters witnesses. All customs officials were seen wearing face masks and truck driers wearing protective gears before crossing the border. 
""Things start to go well again when the trucks are allowed to go through the border now,"" 51-year-old truck driver Nguyen Trong Cang told Reuters. ""The paperwork and procedure has been made convenient for us drivers, so the first steps have been good but the road ahead is going to be tough still.""
""The outbreak has affected us greatly,"" Cang said. ""Some of our trucks have been held up here since early this month.""
The ministry said, however, that cross-border trade had not been fully restored as ""the Covid-19 outbreak is anticipated to last for a long time.""
""Customs clearance will take a longer time due to the strict measures taken to prevent the disease,"" the ministry said. 
A survey of American Chamber of Commerce members in Vietnam last week showed U.S. manufacturing firms operating in the country are suffering supply chain issues caused by the coronavirus epidemic.
The Vietnamese government said on Friday it will stick to this year's economic growth target of 6.8% and take steps to ease the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.

Vietnam's Ministry of Health said on Thursday that 15 out of 16 confirmed coronavirus cases in the country have now been cured, while 28 suspected cases are being quarantined at local hospitals.

LOME (Reuters) - Many people in Togo have only known just two presidents in their lifetime - Faure Gnassingbe, who is running for a fourth term in an election on Saturday, and his father Eyadema Gnassingbe - and some Togolese are sick of the long-running dynasty.
One such person is Farida Nabourema, 29, a pro-democracy activist who has organized protests calling for the president to step down. She is determined that her children should grow up under somebody other than a Gnassingbe, though she is realistic about the challenges.
""We don't have high hopes that the opposition will be able to win,"" said Nabourema, director of the democracy campaign group Togo Civil League. ""We just hope there won't be any more unnecessary bloodbath.""
The opposition is weakened by division and Gnassingbe is seen by political analysts as a shoo-in to win, despite widespread demonstrations against his rule in 2005 and 2017 in which hundreds died during clashes with police.
In response to political pressure, Gnassingbe enacted a law last year limiting presidents to two five-year terms. However, it is not backdated to account for the three terms he has already served, so he could stay in power until 2030.
His father seized power in a 1967 coup in the coastal West African country, a former French colony with a population of 8 million people.
Togo is the 10th poorest country in the world, according to the International Monetary Fund, and the country received 330 million euros in European Union aid between 2014 and 2020. The EU froze aid from 1993 to 2007, citing the country's poor democratic record.
Gnassingbe has long promised to boost economic development and the country has seen annual economy growth of around 5% in recent years, driven by investment in energy and transport.
The capital Lome is home to pan-African Ecobank and major regional airline Asky, and the country has so far been spared the kind of jihadist violence that has hit neighboring Burkina Faso not far from Togo's border.
But grinding poverty and labor strikes are reminders of the challenges ahead.
Many voters who spoke to Reuters see little way out if Gnassingbe stays in power.
""All of this is just comedy. How many times have we voted in this country and the results said something different?"" said Espoir Gamado, a 45-year-old IT engineer. ""I won't be voting.""
VICTORY IS ASSURED
When Gnassingbe came to power in 2005 after his father's death, mass protests erupted that were met with a violent police crackdown and at least 500 were killed.
And yet, despite several attempts, the opposition has not formed a united front, and some experts believe Gnassingbe could win in the first round, without having to go to a run-off vote next month.
""Thanks to God, I think the victory is assured,"" he told supporters last week in the northern opposition stronghold of Sokode as a crowd cheered and soldiers looked on.
Some 10,000 security forces will be deployed on voting day, the government has said.
Longtime opposition leader Jean-Pierre Fabre, a former journalist and human rights campaigner, is running for a third time, after coming second in 2010 and 2015. He has promised to restore democracy and fuel development.
Five other candidates are competing, including former Prime Minister Gabriel Messan Agbeyome Kodjo, who represents a coalition of opposition and civil society groups.
Fabre said that authorities blocked his campaign rallies and raised concerns about the transparency of the vote.
The electoral commission will maintain a centralized counting system, in which results are sent from voting precincts to its headquarters rather than being announced in each constituency. Critics say this makes vote-rigging easier but the authorities have said the election will be free and fair.
The United Nations and regional body ECOWAS have deployed election observers.
Polling stations for the more than 3.5 million registered voters will be open from 0700 GMT and close at 1600 GMT, with provisional results expected six days later."

""That we today stand at the threshold of a peace agreement with the United States is no small milestone,"" Sirajuddin Haqqani wrote in an opinion piece in the New York Times, in the first significant public statement by a Taliban leader on the accord for a week-long reduction in violence (RIV).
The agreement in principle, which was struck during negotiations between U.S. and Taliban representatives in Qatar, could lead to a withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.
""Achieving the potential of the agreement, ensuring its success and earning lasting peace will depend on an equally scrupulous observance by the United States of each of its commitments,"" wrote Haqqani, who is also head of the Pakistan-linked Haqqani Network.
Clashes between Afghan forces and Taliban fighters have continued, but Afghanistan's acting interior minister said on Tuesday an agreement to cut violence would be enforced within five days.
Haqqani also addressed fears about Afghanistan becoming once again a springboard for Islamist militants, calling such concerns ""inflated.""
Writing about how women's rights in Afghanistan would look if foreign forces left, Haqqani envisioned an ""Islamic system"" in which ""the rights of women that are granted by Islam — from the right to education to the right to work — are protected.""
The Taliban banned women from education and work and only let them leave their homes in the company of a male relative. Overnight, women disappeared behind the all-enveloping burqa, their activities restricted to their homes.
Haqqani stressed in the piece the need for a complete withdrawal of foreign forces. Officials in Afghanistan and the United States have said a certain number of troops would remain in the country to ensure stability.
The Afghan presidential palace reacted strongly to the article.
""It is sad that the (New York Times) has given their platform to an individual who is on a designated terrorist list. He and his network are behind ruthless attacks against Afghans and foreigners,"" Sediq Sediqqi, a palace spokesman, told Reuters.
Meanwhile, recently reelected Afghan President Ashraf Ghani met U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad for the second time in 24 hours on Thursday to discuss issues related to peace talks and the details of the RIV, Sediqqi said on Twitter."

MASERU (Reuters) - Lesotho's Prime Minister Thomas Thabane will be charged with the murder of his late wife, the deputy police commissioner said on Thursday, the latest twist in a love triangle murder case that has stunned the southern African highland kingdom.
The 80-year-old Thabane took to the radio to announce that he would step down at the end of July, but he did not mention the case. 
He instead cited old age as a reason for quitting as premier of the tiny, mountainous territory encircled by South Africa and which has a long history of political instability.
Thabane had been under mounting pressure over the death of former first lady Lipolelo, who was shot dead in June 2017 near her home in the capital Maseru two days before he took office.
The prime minister's current wife, Maesaiah Thabane, was detained this month and charged with ordering the murder, but is currently out on bail.
""The prime minister is going to be charged with the murder. The police are preparing directives and he will probably be charged tomorrow,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police Paseka Mokete told Reuters by telephone.
Both she and Thomas, who married two months after Lipolelo's killing, have denied any involvement in her death.
His spokesman Relebohile Moyeye said by telephone that he could not comment because he had not yet seen the police charges.
Police say that Maesaiah, 42, hired eight assassins to kill the former first lady but that she was not present at the shooting.
Lipolelo, then 58, and Thabane were going through an acrimonious divorce at the time. An unknown assailant shot her dead in her car.
The prime minister's resignation comes days after his party's executive council called for him to step down immediately.
""I have served my country diligently,"" Thabane said on state radio.
""I've worked for a peaceful and stable Lesotho. Today ... at my age, I have lost most of my energy ... I hereby retire as prime minister with effect from the end of July.""
Thabane is set to appear in court on the murder charges on Friday, the deputy commissioner said, adding that the charge sheet had already been prepared but that Thabane's lawyers had requested an extra day.
""I think it's high time he goes (from office) but I don't know why it's taking so long. He has to go for the sake of the nation,"" Malineo Stoffels, a 30-year-old businesswoman who sells grilled meat and rice from a food van, said after listening to the announcement on a taxi radio in Maseru.

""Everyone is talking about us (Lesotho), the economy has gone down,"" she said. ""It has to end"".

The camels left Tripoli's port shortly after midnight on Wednesday, and were herded along a highway leading west to the city of Zawiya, some 45 km (30 miles) away, where they arrived on Thursday morning, according to a local merchant.
However, he said that a local armed group had stolen 125 of the camels as they passed through the Tripoli suburb of Janzour.
A Reuters reporter saw about 20 camel herds whipping the camels into line as they left central Tripoli, with some camels trying to search for food along the side of the road. Security forces temporarily closed the road to let them pass.
The merchant said a fellow businessman from Zawiya bought the camels after hearing they were being sold off cheaply in Australia, where according to Australian media reports, thousands of camels that had begun searching for scarce water in residential areas have been culled.
Camels are often imported to Libya from Sudan along with goats, and camel meat is widely eaten.
Tripoli's port, which is close to the city center, was shelled on Tuesday by forces loyal to east Libya-based commander Khalifa Haftar, who has been waging an offensive to take Tripoli for more than 10 months.
He has been battling forces aligned with the internationally recognized government, which is based in Tripoli.
The Libyan capital has been the scene of several rounds of fighting since former ruler Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011.
The conflict has caused a sharp decline in living standards in the oil-rich nation, including power cuts and fuel shortages.
The camels would normally have been driven to Zawiya in trucks, but none were available, so the owner decided to make them walk for fear that the port would come under renewed fire.
As the camels were being herded along the road, some onlookers made fun of the government, saying it was bringing in camels as a substitute form of transport because of the lack of petrol."

The secret operation, complete with machinery that could produce up to 3,500 cigarettes an hour, was hidden in a maze of tunnels accessible only through a trapdoor covered with hay in a stable block, the Interior Ministry said on Thursday.
But once the suspected kingpins were seized, no one replenished the generator that provided oxygen to the workers, a mix of Ukrainian and Lithuanian nationals.
This left them gasping for air as they shouted and banged on the soundproofed trapdoor to raise the alarm to the police investigating above their heads.
""Once inside, the police agents saw with great surprise the six workers who were struggling to breathe in an utterly insalubrious atmosphere,"" police said.
""If the officials had not found the clandestine factory in time, the lack of oxygen would have soon made ... the underground conditions incompatible with the survival of the workers who were there.""
The underground factory in Monda, near Malaga in southern Spain, housed an indoor cannabis plantation and sophisticated machinery enabling even the plastification of cigarette packs, all kept away from prying eyes by ""enormous security measures"", according to police documents.
In its statement, the ministry said it was the first subterranean illegal tobacco plant discovered in Europe.
Spanish police, working alongside Interpol in the sting operation dubbed ""Hannibal"", confiscated 153,000 packs of cigarettes, more than 17 tonnes of rolling tobacco, 20 kg of hashish and 144 kg of marijuana.
Twelve Britons suspected of leading the operation were arrested and are being held in custody.
The six workers were freed pending the outcome of the investigation.

Dassault Aviation  and Airbus will build the aircraft, which is expected to be operational from 2040 with a view to replacing Dassault's Rafale and Germany's Eurofighter warplanes over time. 
""This is a very ambitious project between France, Germany and joined by Spain,"" French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly told reporters after a signing ceremony with his counterparts from the other two countries.
""It will enable our nations to face the threats and challenges in the second half of the 21st century ... and illustrates our will and ambition for a European defense.""
Germany's parliament approved financing for the project last week. Spain is party to the initial phase and will formally join the project later in 2020, investing about 50 million euros.
The new Future Combat Air System's (SCAF) contract includes the initial research and technology for the prototype aircraft, the engine, drones to accompany the warplane and an air combat cloud.
The prototype will see total investment of about 4 billion euros before it is completed in 2026. Production of the jet is due to begin in 2040.
Dassault and Airbus will build the fighter jet. Safranand MTU Aero Engines will develop the engine. Airbus and MBDA will work on the drones. Airbus and Thales SA are in charge of the digital aspects.
The project faces competition from Britain, which in 2018 launched its own plans for a new combat jet dubbed ""Tempest"". French officials have said they hope the two projects will eventually merge. 
Industry executives have urged European capitals to move swiftly or risk losing out in a global market to bigger players led by the United States, or even China in the future.

Merabishvili, who was arrested in 2013, served six years and nine months in prison after being convicted of abuse of power, misspending funds and other crimes, charges he denied as politically motivated.
He served as prime minister for less than four months in 2012 under Georgia's then-president, Mikheil Saakashvili, until their United National Movement (UNM) lost a parliamentary election to the Georgian Dream coalition led by the ex-Soviet country's richest man Bidzina Ivanishvili.

Dozens of ex-officials have been arrested on charges such as abuse of power and corruption since Georgian Dream came to power in 2012. Opposition politicians claim the government is carrying out a witch-hunt against its foes.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police shot dead at least eight people in Nairobi slums in the past two months, violating laws on the use of excessive force, Human Rights Watch said on Thursday, even though officials have said they are determined to end such incidents.
The recent victims of police violence are young men from poor areas shot by officers at close range, the New York-based rights group said.
One was killed last month during a protest in Nairobi's Kasarani neighborhood over poor road conditions.
A witness told Human Rights Watch (HRW) that the 19-year-old was heading to work when he encountered people running from the police. The man dropped to his knees to plead with police to allow him to pass but police shot in him the chest, the witness was quoted as saying.
Kenyan police say they do not use excessive force. ""We have cases where police officers have killed.... they have been arrested and charged in a court of law for the offences they commit,"" police spokesman Charles Owino told Reuters in response to a request for comment on Thursday's report.
A report published last year by the police that said the force was in the process of becoming ""friendlier"" and ""people-centred"".
""...(T)he National Police Service is on a reforms trajectory and has already undergone tremendous changes and transformation aimed at improving service delivery to Kenyans,"" said the report, called ""New Dawn"".
Police in another poor Nairobi district on Christmas Day picked up four young men from a children's home and shot two dead, accusing them of being criminals, witnesses told HRW. Officers removed the bullets and spent cartridges from the scene, one witness was quoted as saying.
The killings come amid public anger in the East African nation over police brutality and the government's failure to hold officers to account despite an official police watchdog that has received tens of millions of dollars from foreign donors.
In November, nearly half of Kenyans surveyed by the police watchdog IPOA said they had suffered police abuse of power.
A 2018 Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/kenya-police-watchdog found IPOA was struggling to fulfill its mandate. At that time, it had secured convictions of police officers for committing crimes in only two cases, despite receiving more than 9,200 complaints since it was established in 2013. To date, it has secured six convictions.
Human Rights Watch said IPOA is investigating two of the eight killings it documented but it is hampered by a lack of police cooperation.
""Police have not stopped killing young men,"" said 27-year-old Lucy Wambui, whose repairman husband Christopher Maina was killed in 2017 by police in broad daylight. Police shot dead a young man from her neighborhood, Eastleigh, two weeks ago, she told Reuters.
Activists reported her husband's killing to IPOA but the watchdog told her last year that the time for investigating had lapsed, she said."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's Constitutional Court has ruled that existing laws criminalizing abortion are unconstitutional and ordered them to be amended, paving the way for clearer regulation for reproductive rights.
Pregnancies in Thailand can be terminated legally if a woman's physical or mental health are at risk, the fetus has a high risk of a genetic disease, or in cases of rape and girls under the age of 15.
However, under another law, a complaint can be filed against a women who has had an abortion, and she can face up to three years in prison or a fine of 6,000 baht ($191.45).
Thailand's top court said this section of the criminal code contradicted the constitution, referring to articles in the constitution that guarantee equal rights for men and women, as well as rights to liberty and life.
""The Constitutional Court resolves in the majority that Sections 301 and 305 of the criminal code should be amended to conform with the current situation,"" the statement read referring to criminal code articles on abortion.
The ruling gives the government 360 days for the amendments and does not immediately change the law. Nevertheless, reproductive and women's rights campaigners said it was a positive step.
""The Constitutional Court has really taken a step forward in the field of reproductive health,"" Surasak Taneepanichskul, president of the Planned Parenthood Association of Thailand told Reuters on Thursday.
Surasak said a lack of clarity under the existing laws could deter health personnel from treating unwanted pregnancies. An amendment would give women more control over pregnancy decisions and allow doctors to treat teen pregnancies more confidently.
""There have been campaigns for these changes for a long time and so this is a new dimension,"" he said.

The vote comes at a time of high friction within the coalition, with the small centrist Italia Viva party sparring on a daily basis with its much bigger partners, the Democratic Party (PD) and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
However, party discipline prevailed in the Senate vote, where Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's administration has a particularly slender majority, and the government won the motion by 156-118.
Confidence votes are often used in Italy to accelerate the passage of legislation by truncating debate. If the government loses a confidence vote it is obliged to resign.
The coalition will almost certainly have to call a confidence vote on the same bill in the lower house before the end of the month, or else the legislation will expire.
The law will let magistrates extend the use of Trojan-horse style software to help them prosecute crimes against the public administration. It will also allow for probes to be extended if the spying throws up evidence of unrelated criminal activity.
The legislation was championed by 5-Star, which has made fighting corruption one of its core concerns. Critics of the bill say it gives too much power to magistrates to snoop on people's lives."

LUCKNOW (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to ""drain the swamp"" of lobbyists and elites in Washington D.C. Now, one Indian city is racing to clean up a stagnant river as he prepares to visit. 
Trump arrives in India on Feb. 24 on a maiden two-day trip that aims to repair bilateral relations hurt by a trade spat. 
He plans to visit the western city of Ahmedabad and India's capital New Delhi, as well as Agra, where he will view the famed monument to love, the Taj Mahal, at sunset. 
In the city, authorities are on a clean-up drive, including the polluted waters of the Yamuna river, that backs on to the monument complex. 
Jal Singh Meena, an officer with the Agra Ganga Nahar, the government body that manages the canal network that feeds into the Yamuna in Agra, said on Thursday an additional 17 million litres of water are being released from three locks in the week preceding Trump's visit on Monday- more than double the usual amount. 
The extra flow had been ordered ""to keep it clean and remove the foul smell,"" he told Reuters. 
On Thursday, workers scrubbed walls and fountains at the monument, commissioned in 1632 by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his late wife Mumtaz, TV channels showed.
India's best-known attraction, the Taj Mahal is visited by nearly seven million tourists a year, according to official data, but has been blighted by overcrowding and pollution. 
Along with polluted water, authorities are battling some of the world's filthiest air that stains the white marble of the monument, and increasingly aggressive troops of monkeys that have been known to attack visitors. 

District authorities have denied local media reports they have relocated some of the more troublesome primates for the visit, and that a bridge on a proposed route taken by Trump will be unable to bear the weight of his armour-plated limousine known as ""The Beast"".

AL-WALAJA, West Bank (Reuters) - Omar Hajajla may have a private gateway to his home in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, but it is hardly a sign of luxury: it runs beneath an Israeli barrier that cuts him and his family off from the rest of their nearby Palestinian village. 
Israel began building its West Bank barrier in 2002 at the height of a Palestinian uprising, saying it aimed to stop attacks by bombers and gunmen in its cities.
But the barrier's circuitous route along and through the West Bank - Palestinians call it a land grab - slices through some Palestinian communities. 
In Hajajla's case, it boxed him off from his village of Al-Walaja, near Bethlehem, part of West Bank territory Israel captured in a 1967 war. 
""Prison may be better than this, because even though I am at home, it feels like prison,"" said Hajajla, 53, who lives in the house with his wife and three children. 
After appealing to Israel's Supreme Court, Hajajla in 2013 reached a settlement under which the Israeli Defense Ministry built a tunnel and a remote-operated gate under the barrier, he said, giving his family access to their village. 
That underground bypass road, strewn with graffiti, is now the sole entrance to Hajajla's home. 
The family needs permission from Israel's military to use their remote control to open the gate and take their children to school or go to the grocery store, Hajajla says.
Israel could take away his remote access if he violates a series of conditions, Hajajla says, including having guests over without coordinating their visit in advance with the military.
""My wife and I try as much as we can to keep our life normal,"" Hajajla said. ""We try to give our kids a break from this routine, to teach them that this is our land, our country, and we will never let it slip away.""

U.S.-sponsored Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking stalled in 2014. A new U.S. peace plan, unveiled by President Donald Trump last month, envisaged Israel keeping East Jerusalem and swathes of West Bank land, and was rejected by the Palestinians.

HANAU, Germany (Reuters) - A suspected right-wing extremist shot nine people dead in two shisha bars in an overnight rampage through a German city before, police believe, returning home and killing himself.
Federal prosecutors said they had taken charge of investigations into the attack - which happened late on Wednesday in Hanau, east of Frankfurt - due to indications it had an extremist motive.
Newspaper Bild said the suspect had expressed far-right views in a written confession.
In shisha bars, customers share flavored tobacco from a communal hookah, or water pipe. In Western countries, they are often owned and operated by people from the Middle East or South Asia, where use of the hookah is a centuries-old tradition.
Some of those killed were of Turkish origin, a spokesman for 
the Turkish presidency said. ""We expect German authorities to show maximum effort to enlighten this case. Racism is a collective cancer,"" Ibrahim Kalin said on Twitter.
Police could not immediately be reached for comment on the Bild report.
They said earlier that said a second body was also found at the suspect's home. 
""There are no indications that other suspects were involved. One of the two dead people found is highly likely the perpetrator,"" police said in a statement early on Thursday, adding that investigations into the identity of gunman and victims were ongoing.
Bild, Germany's biggest selling daily newspaper, said without citing a source that the suspect also left a video claiming responsibility.
Can-Luca Frisenna, whose father and brother run one of the two bars attacked, said he rushed there after learning about the shooting.
""I heard my father was affected and my little brother, they run the kiosk, I don't have much to do with it,"" said Frisenna. ""But then I saw them both - they were horrified and they were crying and everything. So everyone was shocked.""
At one of the bars on Thursday morning, forensics police in white overalls inspected the crime scene, cordoned off close to Hanau's historic market place. Nearby, traffic flowed as normal and commuters waited for buses.
Police said their information suggested the gunman had committed suicide at his home after fleeing in a car.
Bild said the suspect was a German citizen and that ammunition and gun magazines were found in the vehicle. He had a firearms hunting license, it added.
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted: ""Deep sympathy goes out to the families concerned, who are mourning the loss of their dead. With the injured, we hope they will soon recover.""

Last October, an anti-Semitic gunman who denounced Jews opened fire outside a German synagogue on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year, and killed two people as he livestreamed his attack.

693,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 05:33AM ET</span>","Israel, Palestinian Authority agree to end trade dispute: officials","JERUSALEM/RAMALLAH (Reuters) - Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) have reached an agreement to end a five-month long trade dispute, officials said on Thursday.
The dispute, which opened a new front in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, began in September when the PA announced a boycott of Israel calves. The Authority exercises limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank under interim peace deals.
In response to the boycott, Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett in January announced a halt to all agricultural imports from the PA, which in turn prompted the Authority to end imports of Israeli agricultural products. 
Palestinians in the West Bank send over two-thirds of their farming exports to Israel, whose agriculture ministry says the calves boycott affected around 400 Israeli cattle breeders, costing them a total of $70 million since October.
A final tit-for-tat move in the trade dispute came on Feb. 8, when Israel's defense ministry banned all Palestinian exports through Jordan, apparently in an effort to entice the PA to lift its ban on Israeli calves. 
In a statement announcing the agreement, Israel's defense ministry said that ""the calf boycott has been lifted, (and) trade with the PA will be restored accordingly"". 
The actions of the PA had in part reflected greater efforts to end what it sees as over-dependence on Israeli markets. The PA prime minister's office said in a statement that under the agreement Israel would allow the PA to begin the ""direct import of livestock, including calves, from all countries around the world without obstacles"". 
The trade dispute had threatened to fray trade links that have generally held strong since the two sides signed the interim peace accords in the 1990s, even weathering the collapse in 2014 of peace talks.

Bilateral tensions have been further fueled by the announcement last month of U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan and an ensuing string of violent incidents in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians have rejected the proposal as favoring Israel.

(Reuters) - In the wee hours of Jan. 8, Tehran retaliated over the U.S. killing of Iran’s most powerful general by bombarding the al-Asad air base in Iraq.
Among the 2,000 troops stationed there was U.S. Army Specialist Kimo Keltz, who recalls hearing a missile whistling through the sky as he lay on the deck of a guard tower. The explosion lifted his body - in full armor - an inch or two off the floor.
Keltz says he thought he had escaped with little more than a mild headache. Initial assessments around the base found no serious injuries or deaths from the attack. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted, ""All is well!""
The next day was different.
“My head kinda felt like I got hit with a truck,” Keltz told Reuters in an interview from al-Asad air base in Iraq’s western Anbar desert. “My stomach was grinding.”
Keltz, who said he had concussion symptoms for days, is among 109 soldiers diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries in the wake of last month’s attack, a figure that has steadily risen as more troops report symptoms and get medical screening.
Reuters interviewed more than a dozen officials and soldiers and spoke with brain-injury specialists to assemble the most comprehensive account so far of the nature of the soldiers’ injuries and how they sustained them.
The slowly rising casualty count underscores the difficulty in detecting and treating what has become one of the most common injuries in the U.S. military during two decades of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, where U.S. troops face roadside bombs, rockets and mortars.
More than a week after the attack, on Jan. 16, Defense Secretary Mark Esper was made aware that soldiers had suffered brain injuries from the missiles, the Pentagon said. That day, the Pentagon reported that an unspecified number of troops were treated for concussive symptoms and 11 were flown to Kuwait and Germany for higher-level care.
On Jan. 22, Trump said that he ""heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things,” prompting criticism from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers and a U.S. veterans group that the president was underplaying the casualties from the attack.
""I think it was unfortunate to use those words,"" said Republican Representative Richard Hudson, who represents Fayetteville, North Carolina, home to Fort Bragg that includes the Army's Special Operations Command.
The White House declined to comment for this story.
A DIFFERENT CLASS OF WOUNDS
The U.S. military has long treated brain injuries as a different class of wounds that do not require rapid reporting up the chain of command, unlike incidents threatening life, limb or eyesight.
Since 2000, nearly 414,000 service members have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries, or TBIs, according to Pentagon data. The number is likely higher because the Pentagon only counts as one injury cases where a soldier suffers brain trauma in multiple incidents.
U.S. troops operating drone flights appeared to have suffered the most brain injuries during the attack on al-Asad, said Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Garland, who was on the base at the time. Many worked near the air strip, he said. Like Specialist Keltz, who was manning a guard tower, the drone pilots had been assigned to watch for a possible ground attack.
""Those drone pilots, they're the ones that took the brunt of the TBI cases,"" said Garland, who as commander of Task Force Jazeera oversees more than 400 soldiers.
The number of troops diagnosed with brain injury from last month’s attack was expected to stabilize near the current count, one U.S. official said. Less than 10 were now being monitored with possible TBI symptoms, the official said.
The total U.S. military count, however, excludes civilian contractors on the base at the time, many of whom have since departed.
Some U.S. troops also suffered from anxiety-related symptoms after the attack, including sleeplessness and, in at least one case, a sustained high heart rate, according to interviews with soldiers and officials. However, they could not provide a specific number.
The Pentagon categorizes brain injuries as mild, moderate, severe or penetrating. The vast majority of injuries are classified as mild, as were all of the injuries reported from al-Asad.
STANDING GUARD
Garland, the commander, said he was taken aback when he learned of U.S. intelligence indicating that Iranian missiles would strike within hours. He immediately found a base map and started sizing up the best options to shelter his troops.
He recalled old bunkers on the base built during the era of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi dictator toppled by U.S.-led forces in 2003. But the bunkers wouldn’t hold everyone. Some would need to disperse, taking cover in armored vehicles driven away from targets.
Others in Garland’s unit -- including Specialist Keltz --would need to stand guard to watch for additional attacks beyond the expected missiles.
Keltz said he and a fellow soldier were already manning a tower when First Sergeant Larry Jackson came to them, explaining the intelligence and giving them their orders.
""What I need you boys to do is to lay down on the ground when the impacts happen - and then I need you to jump right back up and man those guns,” Jackson said in an interview, recounting his instructions to Keltz and other soldiers at the base.
As the Iranian missiles streaked through the night sky toward the base, their engines glowed orange - like the ends of lit cigarettes, Garland said. The glow was all that Garland could see in the darkness before scrambling back into a bunker.
Then came the blasts. At least eleven missiles struck the base, destroying housing units made from shipping containers and other facilities.
""Every explosion I heard, I was thinking, OK, that's a number of people that have just lost their lives,"" he said.
But initial checks after the attack showed nobody was killed or obviously injured, despite massive devastation to the base. Word got back to Washington. Just before 6 a.m. in Baghdad, Trump tweeted an update: ""Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good!""
FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS
On the ground at al-Asad, U.S. Army Major Robert Hales, a doctor who is deployed to al-Asad, defended the initial reports of no injuries.
""Everyone here did not have any outward physical injuries,” he said in an interview. “There were no lacerations. There's no shrapnel wounds.""
Such “silent” injuries take time to manifest, he said.
Injury figures kept climbing in the weeks after the attack. What began as at least 11 cases grew to 34 about a week later.
On Jan. 22, Trump made his controversial comment, referring to the injuries as “headaches.” The Veterans of Foreign Wars demanded an apology for Trump's ""misguided remarks"".
A week later, on Jan. 28, the toll of brain injuries climbed to 50. In early February, Reuters was the first to report that the count had surpassed 100.
The brain injuries sustained in the Iranian missile attack are fundamentally different than those that have typically resulted from past attacks, brain-trauma specialists said.
That’s because the al-Asad bombing was more intense than typical quick-hit, single-explosion attacks: The explosions came in waves and lasted more than an hour.
When a roadside bomb goes off in Afghanistan, head wounds are often visible. In insurgent bomb blasts, shrapnel or other flying debris can cause brain injuries upon impact. But the damage from large pressure waves from a major blast - like the ones at al-Asad that Specialist Keltz felt - often take more time to diagnose.
Marilyn Kraus, director of the Traumatic Brain Injury program and concussion clinic at George Washington University, said troops may minimize or underreport their symptoms initially. Others may not show symptoms until much later in part because their injuries are initially masked by the adrenaline rush that comes with combat.
""Some of these things can fall into the cracks initially,"" said Kraus, who previously served as medical director of the Traumatic Brain Injury Consult Section at the Walter Reed military hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.
In the short term, mild traumatic brain injury can cause headaches, nausea, dizziness and confusion, while longer-term effects can include chronic headaches, mood changes and dizziness, Kraus said. Repeated head injuries can lead to Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, a brain degeneration disorder that some researchers have linked to suicidal thoughts, substance misuse and depression, she said.
Hales, the Army doctor, cited research within the past six months showing in animal models that signs of damage to the brain can increase in the weeks after a blast. At al-Asad, soldiers started showing symptoms such as headaches or a ""foggy feeling” days after the attack, Hales said. The symptoms often persisted.
""That's the reason why you saw a huge delay” in identifying the injuries, he said. “That prompted us to re-screen pretty much the whole population of al-Asad.""

KIEV (Reuters) - Residents in central Ukraine protested the arrival of a plane carrying evacuees from China's Hubei province on Thursday, fearing they could be infected with the coronavirus despite authorities insisting there was no danger.
Protesters from the village of Novi Sanzhary blocked the road leading to a sanatorium where the evacuees are due to be held in quarantine for at least two weeks to make sure they were not carrying the virus.
Hundreds of police were dispatched to keep order, and some were seen dragging some protesters away from the crowd at the demonstration, which the authorities said had started overnight.
The protest prompted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to issue a statement reassuring Ukrainians that there was no danger, that the authorities had done everything possible to make sure the virus would not spread to Ukraine.
""But there is another danger that I would like to mention. The danger of forgetting that we are all human and we are all Ukrainian,"" he said.
""Attempts to block routes, block hospitals, not allow Ukrainian citizens into Ukraine - this does not show the best side of our character. Especially when you consider that most passengers are people under 30 years of age. For many of us, they are almost like children.""
In addition to 45 Ukrainians, there were 27 citizens of Argentina on the plane that landed in Ukraine on Thursday, as well as citizens from the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Kazakhstan, Costa Rica and other countries.
The Ukrainian authorities say all passengers on board had been screened twice for the virus before being allowed to fly, but that was not enough to quell the protesters.
""I ask people not to sow panic - everything is fine. All who are on board they are healthy,"" Kharkiv regional Oleksiy Kucher told a televised briefing.
Ukraine has no confirmed cases of the virus.

VIENTIANE (Reuters) - China called for solidarity on Thursday in a special meeting to discuss the coronavirus outbreak with Southeast Asian nations as it faces criticism for its handling of the epidemic.
The hastily called summit in Laos signaled China is seeking support from smaller neighbors, into which it has poured billions of dollars in infrastructure and investment in recent years.
China's foreign minister urged Singapore to ease its ban on Chinese visitors and discussed travel and trade restrictions at the meeting with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Thursday. 
At the meeting, ASEAN foreign ministers joined hands with Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and shouted ""Stay strong, Wuhan!"" Stay strong, China! Stay strong, ASEAN!"" 
Officials at the meeting on Thursday did not wear masks.
""Fear is more threatening than the virus and confidence is more precious than gold,"" Wang told a news conference afterward. 
""China is promoting a message of friendships in ASEAN to counter the attack from the West that it has been handling the outbreak poorly,"" said Alfred M. Wu, Associate Professor in Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at National University of Singapore.
Beijing has been criticized for its handling of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which emerged from the city of Wuhan in Hubei province in recent months and killed at least 2,000.
Travel restrictions to prevent the spread of the disease, have idled much of the world's second-largest economy and choked key elements of President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of railways, ports and highways..
Countries' responses to the coronavirus have become ""a litmus test for friendship,"" said Tom Baxter (NYSE:BAX), an independent researcher and co-editor of Panda Paw Dragon Claw website, which writes about China's influence overseas.
From Singapore's outright ban to the open-door practices of Beijing's close ally Cambodia, policies on travel from China have varied among the 10 ASEAN nations.
Even as the meeting kicked off, Thailand on Thursday issued a travel advisory urging citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China and advised those already there to leave, hinting that flights to China could be further restricted.
According to a draft joint statement seen by Reuters, both ASEAN and China emphasized the ""growing urgency and need for cooperation"" in combating the virus outbreak and agreed to strengthen ""risk communication"". 
ASEAN and China, its largest trading partner, have an annual travel flow of over 65 million visits. ASEAN nations collectively are also the second-largest trading partner of China. 
In a Wednesday night meeting with Singapore's foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, Wang said Beijing was worried about Singapore's ""restrictive measures"". 
""Now that the epidemic has eased and the situation is under control, we hope that normal exchanges between the two countries can be resumed as soon as possible,"" Wang told Balakrishnan. 
In remarks made during a welcome dinner on Wednesday evening, Wang thanked countries individually for their shows of support during the outbreak, according to a statement from China's foreign ministry. 

He was quoted by the Chinese foreign ministry as saying support from ASEAN countries and other international friend ""made us feel that this winter is not that cold and spring is coming"".

The warning came after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the decision to expel the journalists and defended freedom of speech.
""We reserve the right to take further action,"" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters.
China on Wednesday revoked the press credentials of the newspaper's Beijing deputy bureau chief, Josh Chin, and reporters Chao Deng and Philip Wen, also based in Beijing, ordering them to leave the country in five days. 
The decision came after authorities repeatedly called on the newspaper to apologize and investigate those responsible for the headline of a Feb. 3 column that called China the ""real sick man of Asia"".
Wall Street Journal (WSJ) publisher William Lewis said in a statement that none of the journalists being expelled had any involvement in the column, noting the paper's policy for ""complete separation"" of news and opinions departments.
But Geng said China was ""not interested in the structural divide"" at the newspaper.
""There is only one media agency called the WSJ, and it must be responsible for what it has said and done,"" he said.
Geng did not elaborate on what other measures China might take against the newspaper. 
China last year declined to renew credentials of another Wall Street Journal reporter, Chun Han Wong, who co-wrote a report about an Australian investigation into the activities of a cousin of President Xi Jinping as part of a broader criminal investigation.
Pompeo condemned the expulsion of the three.
""Mature, responsible countries understand that a free press reports facts and expresses opinions. The correct response is to present counter arguments, not restrict speech,"" he said in a statement.
Geng, asked about Pompeo's remarks, said the issue was not about the freedom of speech but about an article that smeared China.
""I want to ask Mr Pompeo this question: If you think the WSJ has the freedom to insult someone, then does the one getting abused have the right to fight back?""

Turkey backs Libya's internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) and has signed a military cooperation agreement to help it repel an offensive by Haftar's forces in the country's east. World powers agreed at a summit last month to halt hostilities in Libya while a political process is underway.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A week shy of his 18th birthday, climate activist Luke Wijohn is planning to take down New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in a general election later this year, having been selected by the Green Party to contest her constituency.
Should he take Auckland's Mount Albert seat off Ardern in the Sept. 19 poll, which appears unlikely, Wijohn would become the youngest lawmaker to be elected in New Zealand.
""What I want is action on climate change and social inequality...that would be the two main points for my campaign,"" Wijohn told Reuters by telephone from Auckland following his selection earlier this week.
Climate change is a key issue in the election this year. New Zealanders have been shocked in recent months as ash from the bushfires in neighboring Australia turned its skies red and its glaciers brown.
Proud of being one of the most pristine, and beautiful countries in the world, New Zealand introduced climate change curriculum in its schools last month.
Parliament passed a zero carbon bill last year, and there are other measure in the pipeline to limit the impact of climate change.
The aspiring politician is far from an unknown quantity, having gained prominence for organizing the 'School Strike 4 Climate' marches in the country last year.
Wijohn's activism also led to a one-year ban from parliament's premises, as the speaker barred him and more than a dozen others for causing disturbances in the public gallery during a protest in support of ethnic Maori land rights.
""Currently in parliament we've got an average age of mid-fifties,"" said Wijohn, who hopes to attract youth voters to the Green cause.
Having become the youngest elected head of state when she won office in 2017, Ardern hardly lacks demographic appeal.
Now 39, she is seen as a liberal, progressive and environment-friendly leader whose coalition, which includes the Green Party, has acted on issues of climate change, social justice, equality. The Greens, however, want more to be done.
Responding to questions sent by Reuters, Ardern avoided mention of personalities but encouraged young people to join politics to make their voices heard.

The vote to pick 290 lawmakers is Iran's first since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers in 2018, to reimpose sanctions that have hit the economy hard.
""The campaigning ended at 8:00 a.m. (0430 GMT) and any campaigning beyond this time is a violation of election regulations,"" state television quoted election organizers as saying.
The Guardian Council, which must approve candidates, has rejected about 6,850 moderate or leading conservative hopefuls in favor of hardliners from among 14,000 applicants seeking to contest Friday's vote.
The election will have no major influence on foreign affairs or Iran's nuclear policy, which is determined by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose hardline loyalists are likely to dominate the parliament.
With Iran facing growing isolation and threats of conflict over its nuclear standoff with the United States amid rising discontent at home, the turnout is seen as a referendum on the establishment, a potential risk for the authorities.
""We anticipate 50% of people will participate in the election,"" Abbasali Kadkhodai, the spokesman for the Guardian Council, told a televised news conference on Wednesday.
Turnout was 62% in the 2016 parliamentary vote and 66% of people voted in 2012. About 58 million Iranians are eligible to vote.
On Tuesday, Khamenei said voting was ""a religious duty"" but some prominent pro-reform politicians in Iran and activists abroad have called for a boycott of the elections.
""We need to launch a strong boycott campaign to respond to the repressive policies of the system,"" jailed human rights activist Narges Mohammadi said from her cell, in a message, posted on her husband's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
Iranian activists and opposition groups are distributing the Twitter hashtags #BoycottIranShamElections and #VOTENoVote widely on social media.
While establishment supporters will vote for hardline candidates, many pro-reform Iranians are furious over the handling of November protests against fuel price hikes that soon turned political, with demonstrators demanding ""regime change"".
A crackdown overseen by the Revolutionary Guards killed hundreds and led to the arrest of thousands, say human rights groups.
The public is also livid over the accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane in January that killed all 176 people aboard, mainly Iranians. After days of denials, Tehran admitted the Guards were to blame."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Two passengers from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship moored near Tokyo have died and 29 people were in a serious condition, Japanese media reported on Thursday, as a second group of passengers disembarked after two-weeks quarantined onboard.
More than 620 of the passengers on the Diamond Princess liner have been infected on the ship, which has been quarantined since Feb. 3, initially with about 3,700 people on board.
Public broadcaster NHK said the deceased passengers were an 87-year-old Japanese man and an 84-year-old Japanese woman.
Kyodo news agency reported 29 people were in a serious condition, including one who had earlier tested negative for the virus. The health ministry could not immediately confirm the reports.
Japan has well over half the known cases outside China due to the ship infections and the rapid spread of the virus and the quarantine operation has sparked criticism of authorities just months before Tokyo is due to host the Summer Olympics.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga defended Japan's efforts. He told a news conference that after measures were put in place to isolate passengers on Feb. 5, the number of new infections was now almost at zero. ""In that sense, we believe the isolation was effective,"" he said.
Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) said in a report issued Wednesday that no new cases of the onset of the COVID-19 disease from the cruise ship were reported on Feb. 16-17 and only one crew member case on Feb. 15.
In a move to reassure the public, the health ministry also issued a statement in both English and Japanese that said all passengers had been required to stay in their cabins since Feb. 5 to contain the virus. The day before, as passengers were being screened, ship events continued, including dances, quiz games and an exercise class.
Criticism of the government has played out in social media as well as in parliament, where Health Minister Katsunobu Kato was grilled again on Thursday by an opposition lawmaker.
SAFE TO GO HOME?
About 500 passengers began disembarking on Thursday while another 100 people were to leave for chartered flights home, a health ministry official said.
An initial batch of passengers who had tested negative and shown no symptoms left the vessel on Wednesday.
Those who have shared a room with people testing positive were required to remain in quarantine, as were crew. The ministry could not confirm how many people remained on board, or when disembarkation would be complete.
More than 150 Australian passengers arrived home after a pre-dawn departure from Tokyo's Haneda airport. They face another 14-day quarantine.
Some Hong Kong passengers also went home, while Canadians were due to leave on a charter flight in the early hours of Friday, a Canadian government spokeswoman said. An evacuation flight was also being arranged for British nationals to leave Tokyo on Friday.
Earlier in the week, the United States evacuated more than 300 nationals on two chartered flights.
A U.S. State Department official said there were still about 45 U.S. citizens on board the cruise ship as of Thursday.
Americans flown back will have to complete another 14 days quarantine, as will returning Hong Kong residents. 
Disembarked Japanese passengers, however, face no such restrictions, a decision that has sparked concern.
The NIID said there should be no problem if people had shown no symptoms for 14 days and had tested negative for the virus during the period their health was under surveillance.

Besides those on the cruise liner and returnees brought home from the epicenter of the epidemic Wuhan in China, about 70 cases of domestic infections have been confirmed in Japan, including 25 in Tokyo, public broadcaster NHK reported.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will hold a wide-ranging enquiry into the causes of recent bushfires that killed 33 people and razed an area the size of South Korea, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday.
Australia has for months been battling hundreds of blazes that began in September - an unusually prolonged summer wildfire season that was fueled by three years of drought, which experts have attributed to climate change.
With firefighters now able to contain the several dozen fires still alight, Morrison said a six-month Royal Commission would investigate preparedness for future bushfires and the need for any changes to the law to clarify who is responsible for overseeing emergency authorities.
""This Royal Commission is looking at the practical things that must be done to keep Australians safe and safer for longer in hot dry summers - conditions in which Australians will live into the future,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney.
Morrison has stoked widespread public anger by refusing to directly link the bushfires to climate change, insisting removing flammable vegetation is ""just as important, if not more"".
His management of the fires was already under the microscope after he was forced into a rare public apology for taking a holiday to Hawaii in November. 
Under mounting pressure, Morrison in January deployed 6,500 military reservists to support state authorities - which he said created a ""constitutional gray zone"".
Managing bushfires is the responsibility of state governments and fire services.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - More than 150 Australians arrived home on Thursday to begin two weeks of quarantine after finally disembarking a cruise ship docked in Japan where more than 600 people have contracted the newly identified coronavirus.
The Diamond Princess, owned by Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp, has been quarantined at Yokohama near Tokyo since Feb. 3, initially with 3,700 people aboard - including 220 Australian holidaymakers.
The Qantas Airways plane chartered to evacuate the Australians arrived at Darwin shortly before 10:00 a.m. (2300 GMT), television footage showed.
The exact number of Australians onboard is not known.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said 169 Australians had asked for evacuation, though those holidaymakers would need to be symptom-free when checked by Japanese health officials prior to boarding the plane.
Morrison will meet with Australia's National Security Committee later on Thursday to discuss whether to extend a ban on the arrival of foreigners from mainland China, two sources told Reuters.
Australia has prevented anyone but citizens and permanent residents from entering the country directly from mainland China since Feb. 1, citing a need to stop the spread of the new flu-like coronavirus that emerged from China late last year.
The restrictions were criticized on Monday by China's ambassador to Australia, who described them as ""harsh"" and an ""overreaction"".
Morrison has said Canberra would be guided by advice from medical experts, despite growing pressure on the Australian economy.
China is Australia's largest trading partner and a major source of tourists and fee-paying students.

711,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 06:37PM ET</span>",New coronavirus spreads more like flu than SARS: Chinese study,"By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Scientists in China who studied nose and throat swabs from 18 patients infected with the new coronavirus say it behaves much more like influenza than other closely related viruses, suggesting it may spread even more easily than previously believed.
In at least in one case, the virus was present even though the patient had no symptoms, confirming concerns that asymptomatic patients could also spread the disease.
Although preliminary, the findings published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, offer new evidence that this novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 people mostly in China, is not like its closely-related coronavirus cousins.
""If confirmed, this is very important,"" said Dr. Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved with the study.
Unlike Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which causes infections deep in the lower respiratory tract that can result in pneumonia, COVID-19 appears to inhabit both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. That would make it not only capable of causing severe pneumonia, but of spreading easily like flu or the common cold.
Researchers in Guangdong province monitored the amount of coronavirus in the 18 patients. One of them, who had moderate levels of the virus in their nose and throat, never had any disease symptoms.
Among the 17 symptomatic patients, the team found levels of the virus increased soon after symptoms first appeared, with higher amounts of virus present in the nose than in the throats, a pattern more similar to influenza than SARS.
The level of virus in the asymptomatic patient was similar to what was present in patients with symptoms, such as fever.
""What this says is clearly this virus can be shed out of the upper respiratory tract and that people are shedding it asymptomatically,"" Poland said.
The findings add to evidence that this new virus, though genetically similar, is not behaving like SARS, said Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla who uses gene sequencing tools to track disease outbreaks.
""This virus is clearly much more capable of spreading between humans than any other novel coronavirus we've ever seen. This is more akin to the spread of flu,"" said Andersen, who was not involved with the study.
The researchers said their findings add to reports that the virus can be transmitted early in the course of the infection, and suggest that controlling the virus will require an approach different from what worked with SARS, which primarily involved controlling its spread in a hospital setting.

713,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 05:51PM ET</span>",Convicted criminals are among the special police terrorizing Venezuela,"By Sarah Kinosian and Angus Berwick
GUARENAS, Venezuela (Reuters) - Since President Nicolas Maduro founded the Special Action Force of Venezuela's National Police two-and-a-half years ago, the squad has earned a fearsome reputation in poor neighborhoods across Venezuela.
Officers in the force have been accused of torture and summary executions by human rights groups, opposition politicians and ordinary citizens.
Last November, Reuters published an investigation into 20 killings by the force, known as the FAES, in which the official narratives of shootings as acts of self-defense were countered by eyewitness accounts, video evidence, death certificates, autopsy reports and other documentation. 
The force has been linked to hundreds of deaths since its creation in 2017.
For all its notoriety, though, the FAES is highly secretive, known for signature dark masks and black uniforms bearing skull insignias but no name tags. Officers typically remain anonymous even after blood is shed.
Now, a court case involving the deaths of two men killed last March by the FAES reveals another little-known fact that Reuters is the first to publicly disclose: Some of the squad's officers are convicted criminals.
According to hundreds of sealed documents submitted by prosecutors in the case, at least two officers accused of involvement in the killings served prison terms before they joined the FAES.
The documents – which include autopsies, ballistic reports, officer testimony and personnel files – also show that at least three other members of the same FAES precinct who aren't being prosecuted over the deadly operation have criminal records of their own. 
It is both illegal and against national police policy for criminals to belong to the FAES. A 2009 law bars Venezuelans with criminal convictions from working as police officers. FAES guidelines and recruitment documents, reviewed by Reuters, say officers should have no criminal record and be of ""good moral character.""
Jose Dominguez, national commissioner of the FAES, in a brief exchange by text message told Reuters that members of the force go through ""select processes"" and ""special training."" He didn't respond to questions about the criminal records of some FAES officers or a request to discuss Reuters' findings in person or by telephone. 
Venezuela's Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, and the Information Ministry, responsible for government communications, didn't return calls and emails by Reuters detailing its findings. 
The presence of convicts within the ranks of the FAES sheds new light on a security force widely considered by Venezuelans to be a mechanism of social control for Maduro, whose government is beleaguered by economic decline, widespread hunger and insecurity, and international sanctions and isolation. 
Hailed by the president as a new means to fight surging crime and violence, the FAES has become as feared as the criminals it was meant to target, especially in poor districts where hardship fans political instability.
People familiar with the FAES say its leaders are more concerned with projecting force and fear than with rectitude.
""They hire people who aren't afraid to commit crimes, to enter a home without a warrant and kill,"" said Nora Echavez, a former chief prosecutor in Miranda, the state where the homicide court case will be heard. ""A criminal does these things easily because they've already done them before.""  
Reuters couldn't determine how many ex-convicts are working within FAES ranks nationwide. Personnel records aren't disclosed by the government. Even the size of the FAES, estimated by fellow police officials to number about 1,500 officers, is held close by the administration. 
The mystery surrounding the force is part of its playbook, professionals familiar with it say. ""The FAES prefer the anonymity,"" said Javier Gorrino, a criminologist and municipal police commissioner in El Hatillo, a district of Caracas, who has interacted with the force. ""A mask causes more terror when you don't know who's behind it."" 
The case in Guarenas, a gritty commuter city 39 kilometers from Caracas, Venezuela's capital, is one of few instances in which the identity and backgrounds of FAES officers has come to light. 
The two men killed there had law-enforcement backgrounds themselves. One was a municipal policeman from Caracas and the other was a former member of the same local force in the capital. Neither was affiliated with the FAES or any of its officers. 
The victims' ties to law enforcement, people familiar with the case say, are likely the only reason that their deaths have prompted further investigation. The cases of thousands of other Venezuelans who have died at the hands of police, allegedly after resisting arrest, routinely go unexamined. 
Alexis Lira, a onetime policeman turned lawyer whose brother was one of the victims in Guarenas, says most families of people killed by cops lack resources and wherewithal to challenge the FAES' accounts of its operations.
""Most people just have to accept it,"" said Lira, who says he now spends much of his days working with prosecutors to seek accountability for his brother's death. ""I don't."" 
His brother was Fernando Lira, a 39-year-old former policeman who had become a graphic designer. Also killed was Lira's friend, Eligio Duarte, a 41-year-old municipal officer in Caracas. Neither man had a criminal record. 
They died March 6, 2019, when a group of FAES officers shot them after a brief car chase. In a statement to police investigators, the FAES supervisor who ran the operation said the men had fired upon his officers first. The police response was ""proportionate,"" the supervisor said in his statement. 
Soon, evidence emerged to the contrary. 
Forensic tests showed that neither Lira nor Duarte, who had gone to Guarenas to collect money owed to Lira's longtime girlfriend, fired a weapon at all. Both men were shot from above, according to autopsy reports, undermining the FAES claim that they were hit in a shootout. 
In a court filing that led to charges of homicide against the FAES supervisor and six officers, a state prosecutor wrote: ""The events did not happen in the way the police officers claimed.""
""NO PLACE ON ANY POLICE FORCE""
Guarenas is the kind of violent place that could have benefited from a new national crime-fighting force. A community of about 200,000 people in Miranda state, east of the capital, it has crime rates that historically have exceeded the average for Venezuela. 
Some gangs, chased out of Caracas in recent years, have moved into hills that surround Guarenas and stretch along the nearby Caribbean coast. Police forces here and elsewhere in Miranda have long been considered corrupt. 
After oil prices plunged in 2014, sending Venezuela into recession, Maduro pursued economic policies that deepened the country's woes. Nearly 5 million people have migrated, about 15% of the country's populace. 
Among the exodus were soldiers, police officers and other public security workers. With wages equal to just a few dollars a month in Venezuela's hyperinflationary economy, few incentives remained to attract qualified candidates to replace them. 
In Miranda, police ranks thinned so quickly that police bosses began lowering standards for recruits, six former officers familiar with the area told Reuters. 
Some hires had criminal records. Area police earned even more of a reputation for bribery, extortion, kidnapping and other crimes with tactics like shaking down citizens for their personal belongings or stopping trucks and looting their cargo.
""There were officers who should have had no place on any police force,"" said Luis Martinez, a retired senior police official who worked in the area. 
Crime soared. The homicide rate, rising across Venezuela, climbed particularly fast in Miranda. 
From 100 murders per 100,000 residents earlier in the decade, the rate in the state by 2017 had soared to 153, according to the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, a research group based in Caracas. The figure was the second-highest in Venezuela and about 30 times the rate at the time in the United States. 
When Maduro launched the FAES in July 2017, his government tasked local police administrators with recruiting officers for the new force. Priorities included loyalty to the ruling Socialist party and a willingness to use aggressive tactics in crime-ridden neighborhoods nationwide, more than a dozen people familiar with those efforts said. 
In April 2018, the National Police launched the area FAES unit, administered from Zamora, a nearby municipality. The force set up headquarters behind a local hospital, next to the morgue. A crudely drawn skull graces a whitewashed plaster wall by the entrance.  
A former Zamora police operations chief, Oliver Alvarez, took command. He built a unit of 120 officers, many of whom came from local and nearby forces, according to employment contracts for the squad reviewed by Reuters. Alvarez couldn't be reached for comment.
Among the new FAES officers was Richard Sanchez, one of those charged in the Guarenas shootings. Sanchez, now 34, was indicted in 2004 for robbery and assault, according to court records. Reuters couldn't determine whether he was convicted of those charges. 
In 2014, he was convicted of robbery and served two-and-a-half years in prison, the court documents show. Reuters was unable to reach Sanchez. 
His attorney, Miguel Pena, also represents all but one of the six other officers charged in the shootings. Pena told Reuters the accused are detained at a FAES barracks in Caracas, but are still officially part of the force. 
He confirmed Sanchez's prior conviction, but said his clients in this case acted in self-defense. ""I'm not saying they're angels,"" Pena told Reuters in an interview. ""But there was a shootout and they were defending themselves.""
Another recruit for the local FAES was Jose Oliveros, an officer who had risen through police ranks in Miranda despite a prior conviction as an accessory to murder. According to court records, Oliveros, now 37, had accompanied two other men when one of them shot a man to death after a 2009 altercation. 
After serving one year of a five-year prison sentence, Oliveros was named deputy director of a small police force near Guarenas in 2017, government documents announcing his appointment to the post show. He became chief of that precinct in 2018 and then chief of another last year, even after joining the ranks of the FAES.
Oliveros, reached by telephone, said he would seek permission from superiors to speak with Reuters. He didn't respond to further efforts to reach him. Julio Ortega, Oliveros' attorney, declined to speak with Reuters for this story. 
""WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!""
The Guarenas shootings followed a failed foreign currency transaction, according to transcripts of testimony by those involved to prosecutors and police investigators. It isn't clear why FAES officers got involved or why the episode turned violent. 
Early on March 2, Maria Gonzalez received a text message at the Caracas apartment she shared with Lira, the former police officer. The couple had been together for 10 years and ran a t-shirt printing business. 
The text offered a basic transaction that many Venezuelans pursue to keep their income from being eroded by hyperinflation. By converting their local currency into dollars, they preserve the long-term value of their earnings. 
Jhonathan Coraspe, a former colleague of Gonzalez from Guarenas, told Gonzalez a friend had $500 in U.S. currency he wanted to exchange for bolivars, Venezuela's currency. In the texts, reviewed by Reuters and corroborated by Gonzalez in interviews, she accepted the transaction. 
That same day, she transferred 1.68 million bolivars, roughly the equivalent value to $500 dollars at the time, to an account Coraspe said belonged to the friend, Ruben Alarcon. Gonzalez then drove the half hour to Guarenas to collect the dollars. 
Reuters was unable to reach Coraspe. After the shootings, he testified to police investigators and prosecutors but has since gone into hiding, according to attorneys involved in the case. Alarcon, the friend, didn't return phone calls or texts from Reuters to discuss the incident.
In Guarenas, Alarcon didn't appear at a pharmacy where Coraspe said he would meet Gonzalez to hand over the dollars. ""I trusted you,"" she wrote Coraspe. ""I feel truly terrible,"" Coraspe replied, and agreed to see her later.  
That evening, Coraspe drove to Gonzalez's Caracas apartment.
He promised to secure the $500. 
Lira, the former police officer, and Duarte, the municipal police officer and friend who would also be shot when the transaction unraveled, were at the apartment, according to testimony by Coraspe and Gonzalez. 
Coraspe told investigators the two men forced him to leave his car as collateral in case he never came up with the $500. Gonzalez said Coraspe volunteered the silver 1997 Honda Civic himself. 
Neither Duarte nor Lira had a criminal record, according to a document Caracas police sent to prosecutors for the case. Five former colleagues told Reuters both men had been upstanding citizens and policemen. 
On the morning of March 4, Coraspe called Hugo Martinez, a FAES officer he knew from his neighborhood, according to Coraspe's testimony to prosecutors. He told Martinez that two men had stolen his car and were trying to extort $500 from him. 
A day later, Martinez told Coraspe to tell Gonzalez he had the $500 but no way to get to Caracas, Coraspe testified. Coraspe texted Gonzalez and said he could meet in Guarenas the following day. 
The next morning, March 6, Gonzalez sent Lira, who left with Duarte to retrieve the money, Gonzalez told investigators. In text messages, Coraspe testified, Lira agreed to meet him at a gas station.
With Lira bound for Guarenas, Martinez called his FAES supervisor, Alexander Uzcategui, and told him about the alleged extortion, transcripts of testimony by Uzcategui show. Martinez told Uzcategui that Coraspe would soon meet the two men from Caracas at the gas station. The supervisor said they and a small group of FAES colleagues would ""await"" them there. 
Reuters was unable to reach Martinez, Uzcategui or any of the other officers charged in the operation. 
At 1 p.m., Coraspe waited at the gas station. Lira and Duarte arrived in a blue Toyota Hilux pickup. Nearby, in two vehicles, FAES officers watched. 
According to Uzcategui's testimony to police investigators, the men in the pickup pulled a gun and forced Coraspe into their vehicle ""under the threat of death."" They sped off, he said. His squad gave chase. 
Coraspe, in his own comments to investigators, said he entered the truck voluntarily. Neither Duarte nor Lira brandished a weapon, he said. Unprompted, FAES officers shot at the moving Toyota, he added.
Frightened, Coraspe pulled the handbrake. The pickup crashed into the roadside. ""We're all going to die,"" Coraspe recalled telling the other men. 
According to the transcript of his testimony, Coraspe emerged from the crash, ran toward a FAES vehicle and got in. Officers, meanwhile, approached the pickup.
Duarte and Lira, Coraspe testified, exited with their hands up. They followed FAES orders to lie down. With the men prone, Coraspe said, he could no longer see them. 
He heard gunshots.
Five minutes later, FAES officers pulled Coraspe from their car and ordered him to lie on the ground, he testified. He saw Lira and Duarte ""lying motionless,"" Coraspe told prosecutors.  
Uzcategui told investigators that Lira and Duarte had fired upon his squad. His officers fired back, shooting both. After the gunfight, he said, officers took the men to a hospital, where a doctor declared them dead. 
""WHAT REALLY HAPPENED""
At 2.30 p.m., Marlon Brito, a detective with the Corps for Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigation received an order from supervisors to go to the morgue, according to his written report for the case. The corps, known as the CICPC, conducts forensic work for the National Police. 
Reuters was unable to reach Brito for comment. 
At the morgue, next to the hospital, Brito saw two bodies.
With a national identity card that had been on Duarte, Brito identified the Caracas officer's corpse. Lira's corpse would later be identified by the English words ""FREEDOM"" and ""History"" tattooed on his left forearm. 
Duarte suffered two bullet wounds to the chest, Brito wrote in his report. Lira had two chest wounds and a gunshot to the stomach. Autopsies confirmed the wounds Brito reported.
From the morgue, Brito drove to the site of the crash and shootings. Uzcategui, the supervisor, stood guard with about 15 other FAES officers, according to Brito's report. 
The Hilux was riddled with bullets, Brito wrote. Photos of the scene reviewed by Reuters also show the pierced pickup. Spent shells littered the area and two pistols lay on the ground.  
Officers told Brito the guns belonged to suspects who had fired upon them. 
Within days, autopsy and forensic reports contradicted the FAES account.
Autopsy results, prepared by a separate government agency, on March 19 concluded that both men had been shot from above. The reports, reviewed by Reuters and also contained in the court documents, say bullets pierced Duarte ""from above down."" Lira was shot ""from above downward.""
Duarte Nuno Vieira, a professor of forensic medicine and medical law at the University of Coimbra, in Portugal, reviewed the autopsy results at Reuters' request. ""The autopsy reports,"" he said, ""are more in line with a context of summary execution.""
In its forensics report, the CICPC concluded that Lira and Duarte's hands had no trace of antimony, barium or lead, telltale chemicals expelled by most guns. 
A forensics specialist in Spain, who reviewed the findings for Reuters, said the report was conclusive. ""They didn't fire a single shot,"" said Francisco Gallego, director of the Technical Institute of Ballistic Studies in Madrid.  
The CICPC report said that forensic evidence and testimony put the seven officers charged at the scene. 
Uzcategui, the supervisor, fired the 9 mm pistol rounds that killed Duarte, the report said. The specificity was possible because the bullets, traced by forensics to Uzcategui's gun, remained in Duarte's body, according to the autopsy. 
Although the rounds that killed Lira left through exit wounds, ballistics in the report indicated that three of the six other officers charged had fired weapons. 
Meyfer Diaz, a 23-year-old recruit who joined the force just two months before the shootings, fired a Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun. A month before the operation, Diaz posted a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) photo of himself in FAES gear. ""Suck it,"" he wrote, ""nothing gets to me.""
Sanchez, the officer who served prison time for robbery, fired his Tanfoglio pistol four times. Investigators traced fourteen other rounds at the scene to Oliveros, the officer who served time as an accomplice to murder. 
Ballistic reports and a FAES document contained in the prosecutors' case file, both reviewed by Reuters, show the rounds came from a Heckler & Koch MP5 assigned to Oliveros. At a July hearing, Ortega, Oliveros' lawyer, argued that his client didn't have the gun on the day of the killings. 
In his testimony to prosecutors, Coraspe, whose phone call set off the episode, said FAES officers after the shootings told him to tell investigators ""it was a confrontation."" Instead, he said, ""I told the officers what really happened.""  
The defendants are scheduled to appear in court in March; the trial is expected to take months. Attorneys leading the prosecution for the state didn't respond to requests from Reuters to discuss the case.  
Alexis Lira, the graphic designer's brother, visits the courthouse and prosecutors weekly to make sure the case is progressing. 
Gonzalez, Fernando Lira's girlfriend and intended beneficiary of the missing $500, after Lira's death gradually grew weaker from a longstanding struggle with pulmonary hypertension. Reuters interviewed her multiple times in late 2019.
On January 3, Gonzalez died of heart failure. 

""She was our companion in this battle,"" said Jeanette Padron, a physician, friend and the longtime partner of Duarte, the other man killed. ""Fernando's death broke her down.""

TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Libya's internationally recognised leader on Wednesday dashed hopes of quickly reviving U.N. ceasefire negotiations after his side withdrew, saying talk of them resuming had been overtaken by events as eastern forces continue to shell the capital.
The eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar, which shelled on Tuesday the port of the capital held by the recognized government, also ruled out a truce with ""terrorists"" and ""Turkish invaders"", suggesting a near year-long battle will continue.
The port is a major entry gate for wheat, fuel and food imports but also an arrival point for Turkish vessels sending arms, drones, trucks and soldiers to help Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj fend off the LNA, which is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan and Russian mercenaries. 
The conflict has cut oil exports by 1 million barrels a day and could deepen a security vacuum that would be exploited by Islamist militants and human traffickers dispatching migrants by boat to Europe.
The Tripoli government left the ceasefire talks late on Tuesday and a defiant Serraj, visiting the shelled port on Wednesday, rebuffed calls to return immediately to the negotiation table.
""There must first be a strong signal from all international players who are trying to talk to us,"" he told reporters, saying this also applied to parallel discussions focused on political and economic issues.
He suggested fighting was likely to continue: ""We have an even stronger signal than that, which is defending our people.""
Photographs showed containers in the port with large black holes in them. The National Oil Corporation and United Nations said shells had almost hit a highly explosive gas tanker. 
Nearly nine years after rebel fighters backed by NATO air strikes overthrew dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya still has no central authority. The streets are controlled by armed factions, with rival governments based in Tripoli and the east.
""We really want a ceasefire and serious negotiations to end the war for the sake of all Libyans,"" Jalal al-Bosairi, a 45-year-old businessman, said in a Tripoli cafe. 
Since the LNA marched on Tripoli nearly a year ago, fighting has displaced 150,000 people.
DIFFICULT TRUCE TALKS
A second round of talks involving military officers of both sides began in Geneva on Tuesday following a summit in Germany a month ago involving countries with major stakes in the conflict.
U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame was trying to convince the Tripoli delegation to stay in Geneva and resume indirect talks earlier on Wednesday, the United Nations confirmed. 
""Delegations are still here (in Geneva) and Dr. Salame has a meeting today with the head of the GNA delegation,"" said Jean El Alam, spokesman for the United Nations Libya mission, referring to the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord.
The Geneva meetings have so far been held in different rooms. Another round of political talks is scheduled next week in Geneva.
LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said his forces had decided to send a delegation to Geneva. But he added: ""There will be no peace, talks or ceasefire with terrorists and Turkish invaders.""
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu met with Haftar and they agreed a political settlement is the only option for Libya, RIA news agency said on Wednesday.
The latest attack on Tripoli is part of an emerging pattern amounting to an apparent power play by Haftar.
His forces last month shut down Libya's main oil ports as European and Arab powers and the United States were meeting with his supporters in Berlin to try to halt the Tripoli fighting.
LNA supply routes are less exposed than those of the GNA as eastern airports and seaports are out of range of the Turkish combat drones used by the Tripoli government. 

In contrast, the LNA uses UAE-supplied drones which cover the whole country, although there have been no air strikes for weeks as Turkey has installed sophisticated defences.

""The aircraft the government has chartered is currently in Tokyo. We will begin pre-flight screening and disembarkation tomorrow evening local time,"" Champagne told reporters in Ottawa.
People with symptoms of the coronavirus will not be allowed to leave, and those who have tested positive will be treated in Japan, he added. There are 251 Canadians on board the Diamond Princess and 47 have tested positive.
On arrival in Canada the evacuees will be transported to an aviation training base in Ontario for a 14-day quarantine period.
Initially with 3,700 passengers and crew, the Diamond Princess cruise liner has been in quarantine since early this month.
On Wednesday, even as some passengers rolled their luggage off the ship, Japanese authorities announced 79 new cases had been discovered on board, bringing the total above 620, well over half of the known cases outside mainland China.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 04:51PM ET</span>","Factbox: Global efforts to develop vaccines, drugs to fight the coronavirus","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Researchers and drug companies are scrambling to develop vaccines and treatments to fight the new coronavirus that emerged in central China in December and has spread to more than two dozen countries, killing more than 2,000 people.
There are no proven treatments for the virus and experts say it could take a year or more to have a vaccine ready. The hope is that strict quarantines in China and elsewhere will contain the virus' spread long enough for scientists to develop tools to fight it. The following is a list of some of those efforts: 
VACCINES
Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize and fight specific viruses or germs, providing immunity against them. China's early release of the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus has allowed several research groups and companies to get a quick start on vaccine development without needing live virus samples.
Several efforts are using various ""plug-and-play"" vaccine platforms to develop vaccines using genetic material, RNA or DNA, specific to the virus.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health has started work using a platform developed by U.S. biotech Moderna Inc. Scientists at the University of Queensland in Australia and Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc are using a different platform. The work is backed by grants from global health emergency group the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Novavax Inc, which said it created a vaccine candidate for Ebola within 90 days of the release of the genetic sequence, has also announced work on a coronavirus vaccine.
Large pharmaceutical companies including Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also are working on coronavirus vaccines, with backing from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).
In China, officials are trying multiple vaccine candidates, including newer DNA and RNA vaccine approaches and a recombinant protein vaccine in which scientists replicate the proteins on the surface of the virus. Sanofi is using a similar method.
Treatments
To speed access to treatments, researchers are repurposing a number of existing drugs in hope of finding something that works against the new virus.
BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc's Galidesivir works by interfering with a virus' ability to replicate. The antiviral has shown promise in a range of viruses, including cononaviruses, and proven to be safe in healthy volunteers. The work is backed by BARDA.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) is developing REGN3048-3051, a combination of two antibodies developed from immunized mice that have been genetically altered to produce ""humanized"" antibodies. The work expands on Regeneron's partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for a related coronavirus. Regeneron will test its drug in humans through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) Inc's remdesivir is an antiviral that failed against Ebola, but has shown promise in monkeys against a related coronavirus. Gilead has partnered with Chinese researchers to conduct two clinical trials coordinated by the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing. The studies were expected to be completed in April.
Chinese officials are testing AbbVie's two-drug HIV treatment Kaletra, which is designed to keep HIV from replicating in people. The hope is that it will do the same with the new coronavirus.
The antiviral favipiravir from Japan's Toyama Chemical was developed to fight RNA viruses such as the new coronavirus. It has shown preliminary efficacy in a 70-patient clinical trial in Shenzhen city, officials said on Saturday. 
The anti-malaria drug chloroquine phosphate is being tested in 10 hospitals in China in more than 100 patients. Preliminary results suggest it has at least some benefit in patients with pneumonia, Chinese officials said. 

Chinese scientists also are treating some patients with blood from coronavirus survivors, an older technique that has been used to fight rabies, diphtheria and other infections. So far, 11 patients with severe pneumonia have shown significant improvement with the treatment, with no severe side effects, officials said.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia’s designated Prime Minister Elyes Fakhfakh‮ ‬on Wednedsay named a new coalition government‮ ‬after reaching an agreement with Ennahda moderate Islamist Party, the biggest power in Parliament, ending an ongoing political crisis of four months.
With this agreement, the proposed government will likely win a confidence vote in Parliament in coming days and the country will avoid an early election. 
Fakhfakh proposed the line-up of a new government on Saturday and then said negotiations would continue after Ennahda party sought some changes. 
President Kais Saied said on Monday he would dissolve parliament and call for an early election if the new government failed to win a parliamentary confidence vote.
Fakhfakh submitted a list of cabinet nominees to President Saied, with Nizar Yaich as finance minister, Nourredine Erray as foreign minister and Imed Hazgui as defence minister. 
The proposed government must be approved by the deeply fragmented parliament in next days.
Among the other proposed ministers in his cabinet are Mongi Marzouk as energy minister, Mohamed Ali Toumi as tourism minister and Thouraya Jribi as Justice minister.
Fakhfakh previously said he wants a government based on the values of the 2011 revolution that would address unemployment and improve public services. 
The cabinet proposed include Ennahda, Tahya Tounes, Achaab , Attayar, El Badil parties and independents. 
Tunisia faces a series of long-term economic challenges which threaten to undermine public trust in the young democracy, and which demand political decisions that could be unpopular.
Tunisian officials said the IMF is waiting for the new government to start talks over a sixth review of its IMF loan program. Tunisia needs to borrow about $3 billion internationally in 2020 to meet spending commitments.
Since the 2011 revolution, unemployment has been high and growth low, while the government has sunk further into debt with a series of big budget deficits that foreign lenders demand it bring under control.

Elections in September and October returned Saied, a political independent, as president, and a parliament in which Ennahda held fewer than a quarter of the seats.

Speaking on the 14th anniversary of the blast, Labor Secretary Luisa Maria Alcalde told a news conference that specialists have identified a new route to enter the Pasta de Conchos mine and plan to resume the search in October.
She also said experts had determined that levels of water and gas in the mine had decreased, permitting workers to search the site safely.
""Grupo Mexico expresses its wish that the efforts undertaken by the government are successful and translate into peace for the families,"" the company said in a statement.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged to recover the bodies last year, but the firm's chief executive warned that past efforts to find the bodies of miners killed in the blast had been ""high risk.""
Some 65 men were killed in the massive mine shaft explosion on Feb. 19, 2006 when methane gas caused the collapse of the mine in the northern state of Coahuila. Only two bodies were recovered.
Grupo Mexico, which operated the mine, has maintained that it was an unfortunate accident and that the firm had compensated families."

(Reuters) - A New York jury began deliberations on Tuesday in the rape trial of former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Regardless of the verdict, Weinstein's legal problems are far from over. 
The producer of ""Shakespeare in Love"" and ""The English Patient"" has pleaded not guilty to raping Jessica Mann, a one-time aspiring actress, and sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi. He faces life in prison if convicted of the most serious charge, predatory sexual assault.
In addition to the New York case, Weinstein was charged in Los Angeles on Jan. 6, the first day of his Manhattan trial, with sexually assaulting two women.
Weinstein is expected to appear in a Los Angeles court to hear the charges regardless of the New York trial's outcome, a spokesman for Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey told Reuters. No date has been set for that appearance.
Weinstein, 67, faces up to 28 years in prison if convicted on the Los Angeles charges. Weinstein has said any sexual encounters he had were consensual.
In California, Weinstein is accused of attacking two women on consecutive nights in 2013. One unidentified woman was allegedly raped.
The second woman, model and actress Lauren Young, testified in the New York trial that she was trapped in a bathroom by Weinstein, who groped her while he masturbated.
Young’s claims are not part of the criminal charges against Weinstein in New York. She is one of three women who prosecutors called as witnesses to bolster their case against the former producer by trying to provide evidence of his motives or methods.
Young testified that social media influencer Claudia Salinas stood outside the bathroom door during the attack, which Salinas flatly denied when she was called by the defense.
In addition to the criminal cases, Weinstein is facing civil lawsuits filed by dozens of women for various allegations of sexual harassment or assault.
Many lawsuits also named as defendants The Weinstein Company film studio he founded with his brother Robert. The lawsuits said the company condoned and facilitated the abuse, which it has denied. 
A lawyer for Robert Weinstein did not respond to a request for comment.
The company filed for bankruptcy protection and sold its operations in 2018. 
Lawyers for many of the women as well as creditors of the company, former board members and insurers have reached a proposed civil settlement worth around $47 million. About $25 million is expected to be available for compensating women who alleged abuse, according to a report by the New York Times.
The agreement would need court approval.
The parties have been trying to finalize the proposed settlement for more than six months. Beth Fegan, the civil lawsuit's lead lawyer, said in an email to Reuters she expects ""to have news by the end of the month.""
Lawyers for seven women, including actress Rose McGowan, who has said she was raped by Weinstein, told Reuters they intend to oppose the settlement.
Several accusers criticized the settlement as low, while also acknowledging the statute of limitations for allegations such as workplace sexual harassment often requires a woman to take action within two years or less. Many alleged incidents happened many years ago, making it difficult to sue, and judges have dismissed claims against board members.
Lawyer Jeff Herman said he hoped women would feel a measure of justice with the criminal trial of Weinstein, regardless of the outcome. The proposed settlement has the support of Herman's client, actress Kadian Noble, who accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her.
""She thought she won the day we filed a lawsuit,"" said Herman. ""She thought she would never have a voice.""

720,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 04:08PM ET</span>",Mexican prosecutors to issue arrest warrants in probe for young girl's murder,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities said on Wednesday they would soon issue arrest warrants for two people wanted for the murder of a 7-year-old girl in Mexico City, the latest in a series of killings that have unleashed outrage over growing violence against women.
Ulises Lara Lopez, spokesman for Mexico City's attorney general, said a nighttime raid on a home in the southern part of the city turned up items that helped investigators identify the suspects, a man and a woman thought to be in a close relationship and working together.
The woman is believed to be the person who was seen accompanying 7-year-old Fatima Cecilia Aldrighett as she left school last week, the last time she was seen alive.
Officials are still investigating the man's connection to the crime, Lara said. The maximum punishment for the kidnapping is up to 180 years in prison, he added.
Family members said hours were wasted after Aldrighett went missing outside her school on Feb. 11, and earlier calls to social services for help went unanswered.
When discovered over the weekend in a plastic garbage bag in the Tlahuac neighborhood, the girl's body showed signs of torture and abuse.
Earlier this week, protesters gathered outside her home and school, while others took to social media to demand justice under the trending topic #JuticeForFatima.
In the wake of anger over her death, Mexico's lower house of congress has proposed increasing the maximum prison sentence for femicide to 65 years, up from 60 years.
Lawmakers also sought to toughen penalties for sexual abuse of minors to a maximum of 18 years, up 13 years.
An average of 10 women a day are killed in Mexico and 2019, the first year of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's government, marked a new overall homicide record. Victims of femicide increased 10% in 2019 to over 1,000.
Days before authorities disclosed the discovery of the girl's body, women took to the National Palace to demand justice for the murder of 25-year-old Ingrid Escamilla, daubing the words ""femicide state"" in blood red on the door."

KABUL (Reuters) - U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Wednesday discussed a U.S. deal with Taliban militants on a weeklong reduction in violence, meeting the day after Ghani was declared a winner of a disputed presidential poll.
Ghani's main rival, Abdullah Abdullah, who came in second, rejected the result and vowed to form his own government, threatening new political turmoil as the United States strives to seal a U.S. troop withdrawal deal with Taliban militants.
The Afghan presidential palace in a statement quoted President Ghani as telling Khalilzad he had held ""effective"" meetings with local leaders on how the Afghan government would handle the peace process.
The U.S.-Taliban deal was struck in protracted negotiations in the Qatari capital Doha and was announced on Friday after a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Ghani and U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper in Munich.
Khalilzad, who has led talks with the Taliban on a U.S. troop withdrawal agreement, briefed Ghani on the steps that will be taken after the reduction in violence agreement comes into force, the presidential palace statement said.
Afghanistan's acting interior minister had said on Tuesday that the accord would come into force in the next five days, even as clashes between the Taliban and Afghan security forces continued.
The statement following the Khalilzad-Ghani meeting did not mention the Afghan president's re-election, which is being disputed by a number of Ghani's political opponents. The United States has not yet formally congratulated Ghani on his re-election for five more years as president.
The United Nations on Wednesday said it would “encourage the electoral management bodies to address the candidates’ understandable desire to have clarity on decisions taken related to audits and recounts.”
The European Union said it said it considered the election process to have reached a conclusion."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Rod Blagojevich, a former Illinois governor forced out of office for trying to peddle Barack Obama's vacated U.S. Senate seat, thanked President Donald Trump on Wednesday for commuting his prison sentence and again proclaimed his innocence.
The 63-year-old Democrat was impeached and removed from office in 2009, and convicted two years later of wire fraud, extortion and soliciting bribes while serving as governor.
One of more than a half-dozen people pardoned or granted clemency by Trump on Tuesday, Blagojevich was released on the same day after serving eight years of a 14-year sentence.
""We want to express our most profound and everlasting gratitude to President Trump,"" Blagojevich told reporters and curious onlookers as he stood outside his home on Chicago's North Side, flanked by his wife and two daughters. Nearby was a sign reading ""Thank You Mr. President"" and a heart balloon swaying in the breeze.
Trump on Tuesday called Blagojevich's sentence ""tremendously powerful, ridiculous."" The president's decision was criticized by both Democrats and Republicans, including some who said that those convicted of political corruption ought to be held accountable.
Speaking to the crowd of about 200 on Wednesday, Blagojevich recited a poem, quoted from scripture and talked about the difficult living conditions in prison.
""I am returning home today from a long exile, a freed political prisoner,"" Blagojevich said.
Blagojevich referred to himself as a ""Trumpocrat.""
""It's been a long, long journey,"" he said.
One of the onlookers, Thurgood Papadopalous, held a large poster of Blagojevich's face but disparaged the former governor to a reporter.
""He's a crook. Probably should have stayed in jail,"" Papadopalous, 33, said.
Blagojevich appeared on Trump's ""Celebrity Apprentice"" reality television show in 2010 while awaiting trial.
""He didn't take any money. He's a good guy,"" said supporter Milan Kostic, 65."

In a trial running Feb. 24 to March 11, former presidential candidate Fillon, his wife Penelope and his parliamentary substitute Marc Joulaud will have to answers questions about the fake jobs scandal that destroyed Fillon's 2017 campaign.
Once a favorite to win the Elysee Palace keys, Fillon’s campaign was plunged into crisis when a satirical weekly reported Penelope had been paid hundreds of thousands of euros for doing little work, including several years as his parliamentary assistant.
The National Assembly, which is a claimant in the case, will seek damages worth 1.08 million euros related to the parliament mandate of Fillon and his substitute Marc Joulaud, who replaced Fillon while he was a government member, National Assembly lawyer Yves Claisse told Reuters.
The claims cover a period from the mid-1980s to 2013.
On a France 2 television program on Jan. 30, Fillon denied that his wife had been paid as a parliamentary assistant while doing little actual work.
""She was my main and most important staff member ... I will provide proof during the trial,"" he said.
When the scandal broke, Fillon denounced what he called a campaign of dirty tricks and denied having done anything illegal, though he admitted an error of judgment.
A former prime minister during Nicolas Sarkozy’s 2007-2012 presidency, Fillon resisted pressure from inside his party to pull out of the 2017 presidential campaign and was eliminated in the first round of the election with 20.01% of the vote.
President Emmanuel Macron went on to beat far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the runoff.
Fillon now works for investment management firm Tikehau Capital."

AZAZ, Syria (Reuters) - Abu Abdallah has been on the road for days. After his family fled the air strikes pounding Idlib, they moved from one village to another in northwest Syria but have yet to find refuge.
""I don't know where to take them,"" the 49-year-old farmer said from his tractor on the side of a road in Azaz town, where he is stranded with his wife, four children and 20 other relatives. ""This is the first time I flee my hometown. God knows where we will go.""
The family is part of the biggest exodus of Syria's nine-year war.
Nearly a million people, mostly women and children, are trying to escape the latest wave of violence in the Idlib region, overwhelming aid agencies.
Many have nowhere to go, trapped between the fighting and the closed-off Turkish border. Families sleep outside in streets and olive groves, burning garbage to stay warm. Some children have died from the cold.
Some of the people fleeing Idlib have already been displaced more than once, after fleeing battles in other parts of Syria earlier in the conflict.
The United Nations said on Tuesday that government warplanes had struck hospitals and refugee camps as the Syrian army, with Russian backing, gains ground in the northwest, the country's last rebel stronghold.
Before she escaped Idlib in recent days, Aziza Hadaja, 70, locked her front door.
It is the third time she has been uprooted, but in the past, she would go back home. This time, after government forces marched into her village, she does not know when or if she will return.
Along with her children and grandchildren, Hadaja is now sheltering in a makeshift tent in a field on the road out of Azaz further north.
""We came out with the clothes on our backs,"" she said. ""We didn't bring a thing."""

Fianna Fail said last week that it would not consider going into government with Sinn Fein, the left-wing nationalists that shocked the Irish establishment by securing the most votes but ran too few candidates to win the most seats.
The center-right Fianna Fail had held informal talks with the smaller Green and Social Democrat parties as well as some independent lawmakers, leader Micheal Martin said on Twitter, adding that he would name a negotiating team later on Wednesday.
His shunning of Sinn Fein means Fianna Fail will need the backing of the 35 deputies from Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael to form a government. Fianna Fail won 38 seats in the fractured 160-seat parliament to Sinn Fein's 37.
""In this general election, the Irish people sent a very strong message that they want a change of government and a new approach on housing, health, the cost of living and climate change,"" Martin said.
""My team and I will be working very hard over the coming period to try to deliver this.""
Fianna Fail said last week that it would speak to smaller parties before Fine Gael, its historic rival. Martin cautioned that the process would be so difficult that he could not rule out another election.
Its options to secure a majority in parliament are to either go into coalition with Fine Gael for the first time along with at least seven other deputies or secure a mirror image of the minority government agreement where Fianna Fail backed the last Fine Gael-led administration from the opposition benches.
Varadkar reiterated this week that Fine Gael was preparing to go into opposition but has said that the party would be willing to help form a government if all other options are exhausted.
Ireland's parliament will meet for the first time since the election on Thursday when Varadkar is obliged to put his name forward for re-election as prime minister. He will assume the role in a caretaker capacity if, as expected, no party leader secures a majority to replace him.
It took Varadkar's predecessor, Enda Kenny, four such votes and 70 days to form an administration after the last election in 2016 and senior lawmakers from all sides expect talks to take a number of weeks."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Demonstrators opposed to a Canadian energy project on Wednesday started blocking a western rail line, adding to pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to solve a two-week protest that is harming the economy.
Freight traffic in eastern Canada has been stopped after campaigners blockaded a main line in Ontario. They say they want to show solidarity with an aboriginal band trying to stop construction of a gas pipeline in the Pacific province of British Columbia.
Trudeau, who insists his government will not use force against the protesters, toughened his language on Wednesday, calling the disruptions unacceptable.

""They're on the CN property, and we're working with the CN police to resolve it,"" local police spokesman Barry Maron told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
Television footage showed the group standing on the rails behind a banner that read ""No pipelines on stolen land."" The company said it was assessing legal options.
The blockades pose a delicate challenge for Trudeau, who says one of his main priorities is to improve relations with Canada's marginalized and impoverished indigenous population.
""This government is working extremely hard to resolve this situation. We know people are facing shortages, they're facing disruptions, they're facing layoffs - that's unacceptable,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa.
His tone was noticeably harsher than in a speech he gave to legislators on Tuesday in which he stressed the importance of ""dialogue and mutual respect.""
Canada's main opposition parties say the federal government should send in police to clear the blockades, which are also hitting Quebec, Canada's second most populous province.

Quebec Premier Francois Legault on Wednesday demanded Trudeau come up with a timetable to end the blockades.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Normally serene Thailand has been on edge since a rogue soldier went on the rampage in a northeastern city this month, killing 29 people in a shooting spree that ended in a standoff with police at a shopping mall.
Ten days later, a man walked into a clinic in a busy Bangkok shopping mall and gunned down his ex-wife before fleeing the scene. He was later arrested.
The killings, along with several other high-profile gun crimes, have called attention to the high rate of gun ownership, even though the number and rate of gun killings has drifted downward in recent years.
Thailand had about 10 million privately owned firearms in 2016, according to Gunpolicy.org, or one for about every seven citizens. Of those, about 4 million were illegal. 
Thais complained on Twitter about their disappearing sense of personal security, with one user, @KMoungdee posting guidelines for an active response to a shooting.
""I can't say whether Thailand has a gun problem, but it certainly has a gun culture,"" said Michael Picard, Research Director of GunPolicy.org of the University of Sydney’s School of Public Health.
""Guns are idolized as symbols of power and privilege, as they are expensive and not easy to legally obtain.""
While the level of gun violence is high compared to some of Thailand's Southeast Asian neighbors, it has been declining for several years. Thailand had 1,034 gun homicides in 2016, down from 2,234 in 2012. Malaysia counted four in 2016, while the Philippines had more than 7,000 in 2011, GunPolicy.org's latest data shows.
While overall gun violence may be declining, a feeling of insecurity has been growing in Bangkok.
Days after the mass shooting in the northeastern city of Nakhon Ratchasima on Feb. 8 and 9, a Bangkok man sent his neighborhood into panic by firing off dozens of rounds in a commercial neighborhood near a university, even though no one was hurt and the man was arrested.
In January, an elementary school teacher robbed a gold shop at a mall in Lopburi province, about two hours north of Bangkok, killing three people, including a two-year-old boy.
BUYING ONLINE 
""Many commentators have lamented the rise of urban violence as Thailand’s metropolitan areas grow. It is possible that urban crime is increasing while other causes of gun-related homicides are falling,"" Picard said. 
Gun laws are seen as strict in Thailand, where possession of an illegal firearm carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years and a fine of up to 20,000 baht ($640). 
However, enforcement is a challenge based on illegal firearms in circulation, corruption in the security sector and new channels for buying guns online. 
""An emerging means of acquiring illegal firearms in Thailand is through social media platforms,"" Picard said.
""This has made it even easier to acquire an illegal firearm, as essentially anyone can do it as long as they have an internet connection and a bank account.""
A secondhand .38 Smith & Wesson can be found online starting at 20,000 baht. 
Legally obtaining a firearm in Thailand is about a three-month application process with the provincial department and a fee of around 1,500 baht, an Interior Ministry official said. 
Most of the gun-related crimes in the last two months, including the mass shooting, were carried out with licensed guns. 
But authorities say that gun-related crimes only gained attention because they occurred in close succession. 
""Gun-related crimes have not increased,"" Deputy police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen told Reuters.

""There are crimes that involve no weapon, and crimes that involve knives, guns and batons and they all can kill people. It's just that the (gun-related) incidents have been happening around the same time.""

A video posted by Muhammad on social media this week, showing him and his three-year-old daughter Salwa laughing at the sound of shelling in Idlib during this game, has gone viral.
Syrian troops, supported by Russian warplanes have been advancing since December against the last rebel bastions in Idlib and Aleppo provinces, in what could be one of the final chapters of the nine-year-old civil war.
Loud noises would startle and frighten Salwa, Muhammad told Reuters Television in the town of Sarmada, so he decided to ask children playing nearby to light a firecracker, demonstrating to Salwa that the noise was just for fun.
""They started laughing, and she started laughing, and saw that the thing is just a game,"" Muhammad said. ""Two days later, the air force hit, and I immediately told her not to fear, it's just kids detonating firecrackers.""

Their reaction: a shrug and grin.
Clyde and Renee Smith, both 80, were separated from their grandsons and taken off the Diamond Princess in the port of Yokohama and hospitalised after testing positive for the virus on Feb. 3.
They told Reuters they didn't have harsher thoughts than surprise when they learned they're still stuck in quarantine because they are on a U.S. no-fly list until they are virus-free anyway.
""We are very happy here,"" Clyde said from the couple's hospital room in western Tokyo. ""They're taking excellent care of us. This is the newest, fanciest hospital I've ever seen,"" while the doctors and nurses ""are the friendliest and nicest I could imagine.""
Public-health officials have said the incubation period for the virus was 14 days, but the Smiths were still positive in a test taken on Monday, two weeks after their initial test.
The Smiths will be tested every 48 hours and must get two negative results before they can leave quarantine.
The news that they were still testing positive was ""a little bit unnerving,"" Renee said, but only because they have things they want to tend to back in Atlanta.
The Smiths said their vital signs have been normal throughout and they have shown no symptoms of the disease, called COVID-19, which has killed over 2,000 people - the vast majority in the region of China around the epicentre in Wuhan.
Japan's public-health response to the biggest outbreak outside China has been heavily criticised: the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the Smiths' hometown said Tokyo's quarantine may not have been sufficient, while a Japanese infectious-disease specialist who had visited the ship as a volunteer doctor said the quarantine was run by ""bureaucrats"" who stoked the crisis by failing to follow basic protocols.
But the Smiths supported Japan's response and understood the need for them to remain in quarantine until they are free of the virus.
""This is so new and unprecedented that I don't think the medical community has any current, firm knowledge of what's going on there,"" Clyde said, adding that Japan was doing its best ""to prevent a real pandemic worldwide.""

733,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 10:01AM ET</span>",German conservative big guns rally behind Merkel,"By Andreas Rinke and Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - A powerful caucus of German conservatives wants Angela Merkel to stay on until her term ends in October 2021, dismissing calls for her to step down sooner and hand power to the next leader of her Christian Democrat (CDU) party.
The succession debate was blown wide open last week, when CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said unexpectedly she would no longer seek to succeed her mentor Merkel, a step that raised questions over the future course of Europe's largest economy.
Explaining her decision, Kramp-Karrenbauer said separating the roles of party leader and chancellor ""weakens the CDU"". That remark fueled speculation that Merkel would have to hand over the chancellor's job to the next party leader.
Much depends on who wins the CDU leadership race, a contest that is just starting and which will likely take months.
But conservative heavyweights are already resisting popular pressure - and some suggestions from within the CDU - for Merkel to go before her term ends 18 months from now.
""Merkel is still very successful and popular in Germany and internationally,"" said Juergen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for the conservatives' parliamentary group. ""So there is no reason to change anything.""
Hardt sits on the parliamentary foreign affairs committee chaired by Norbert Roettgen, who entered the CDU leadership race on Tuesday and said the question of who should run as chancellor could be decided later, around the end of the year.
Andreas Nick, another CDU lawmaker on the same committee, said Merkel's strong standing abroad would be important during Germany's EU presidency in the second half of this year. Talk of her going early was ""a purely academic discussion"", Nick added.
COHABITATION ARRANGEMENT
A cohabitation arrangement of party chair and chancellor would be harder if erstwhile Merkel rival Friedrich Merz wins the party leadership.
The center-left Social Democrats - junior partners in Merkel's ruling coalition - have signaled they could quit the government if she is forced out as chancellor.
In that event, Germany may be plunged into new elections - a scenario that another CDU lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said would ""damage the party's image for stability"".
A further CDU lawmaker reckoned on a 2-3 percentage point dip in support whenever Merkel goes - a potentially critical hit as recent opinion polls put the CDU and its Bavarian CSU allies as little as 3-4 points ahead of the ecologist Greens.
""So there is a lot to be said for the coalition and the chancellor remaining in office until autumn 2021,"" Hardt said.
A survey for Der Spiegel magazine published on Tuesday showed Germans were evenly split on whether or not Merkel should quit when the CDU chooses a new leader and chancellor candidate.
After nearly 15 years as chancellor, Merkel has said she will not seek re-election.
Spiegel has called in an editorial for Merkel to go early. Some conservatives are starting to criticize her more openly.
Health Minister Jens Spahn, a contender to become CDU leader, told Spiegel he respected Merkel ""but now we are looking forward."" And Armin Laschet, premier of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and another contender, on Sunday took aim at her for being too slow on EU reform.
But Daniel Guenther, CDU state premier in Schleswig-Holstein, wants the CDU to keep Merkel center stage right up to the next election. ""We can benefit from the support she has from the people,"" he told broadcaster ARD.
Crucially, CSU leader Markus Soeder said on Sunday: ""I believe that breaking with the chancellor is not right."" Any CDU chancellor candidate will need Soeder's backing."
734,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 10:01AM ET</span>",All eyes on Renzi as fate of Italian government hangs in balance,"By Angelo Amante and Crispian Balmer
ROME (Reuters) - The fate of Italy's six-month-old government hung in the balance on Thursday, with former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi expected to spell out later in the day his conditions for remaining within the ruling coalition.
Renzi heads the small Italia Viva party, which has minimal backing in the opinion polls but has the numbers to bring down Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's government in parliament and is using that leverage to try to gain greater visibility.
Known as one of Italy's most ruthless politicians, Renzi is due to appear on a chat show on Thursday evening following days of sniping against Conte, promising to ""tell things as they really are"".
Renzi has threatened to sink the coalition over a contested justice reform and last week his ministers boycotted a cabinet meeting raising speculation that the government, which only took office last September, might be about to implode.
A senior member of the center-left Democratic Party (PD), which, together with the 5-Star Movement forms the bulk of the coalition, has called on Conte to seek new support in parliament and cut his ties with Renzi.
The coalition has a slight majority in the 315-seat upper Senate and would need to sign up at least 10 new Senators from other groups to make do without Italia Viva.
Renzi has been taunting Conte for days over this parliamentary shortfall and rubbed salt into the wound on Tuesday when he revealed he had managed to poach another senator from his old party, the PD.
""The more they attack us, the more we grow,"" he said on Wednesday on social media.
With the numbers apparently on his side, parliamentary sources said they expected Renzi to lay out his policy priorities on television, including a possible call for broad, cross-party talks on constitutional reform.
However, a spokeswoman for Italia Viva declined to say if Renzi would issue an ultimatum.
""Wait and see,"" she said.
Renzi used to lead the PD and is famous for assuring former PD prime minister Enrico Letta of his loyalty via Twitter in 2014 just weeks before ousting him in an internal PD coup.
Once again revealing his ruthless streak, Renzi quit PD ranks last year after being instrumental in persuading the party to hook up with 5-Star and form a coalition under Conte.
He expected his new party to win strong backing from moderate voters, but its ratings remain anchored around a lowly 4%. This is putting pressure on Renzi to give Italia Viva a stronger political profile clearly differentiated from PD.
""Renzi suffers a credibility deficit ... and is having a real problem reconnecting with voters,"" said pollster Lorenzo Pregliasco."

The decree on dismissal of the military police chief Artur Baghdasaryan and the head of the army's personnel department Aleksan Aleksanyan, both major generals, was published on Wednesday.
Pashinyan, who came to power in a peaceful revolution two years ago after protests against corruption and cronyism, on Monday held consultations with heads of law enforcement agencies discussing situation in the army.
Official statistics say 13 servicemen have died since the beginning of the year due to different reasons, including health problems or suicide, although not in shooting incidents around neighboring Azerbaijan's breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region.
The ex-Soviet states of Azerbaijan and Armenia fought a war over the breakaway territory in the early 1990s in which thousands were killed on both sides. The ceasefire was brokered in 1994, but sporadic shooting still breaks out.
Zhoghovurd newspaper and other local media reported that the dismissals might be related to speculation that Baghdasaryan, who was appointed by the former president in 2017, intended to use force against peaceful protesters during the 2018 revolution.
Pashinyan sacked National Security Service chief Artur Vanetsyan and Chief of Police Vallery Osipyan.
Vanetsyan, who became the National Security Service head after the 2018 revolution, sent Pashinyan a letter, also published in local media, in which he criticized the prime minister's working methods."
736,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 09:31AM ET</span>",Swedish prosecutor says may be close to solving Palme's 1986 murder,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden may soon get closure over the 1986 murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme after the lead prosecutor said he would either bring charges in the coming months or close the case.
Palme was gunned down in central Stockholm in February 1986 after an evening at the cinema with his wife. His death sparked Sweden's biggest ever manhunt and a slew of conspiracy theories.
A nagging sense of unease remains over the police's failure to catch his killer, but prosecutor Krister Petersson held out hope that the case could be solved, saying he was close to wrapping up the investigation.
""We are now working on avenues that are very interesting and my goal is that during the first half of 2020 we will be able to make a decision on whether to prosecute,"" Petersson, head of the Palme investigation, told Swedish TV program 'Crime Week'.
""I still feel positive that we will be able to present what happened on February 28, 1986. What happened at the time of the murder and was who was responsible,"" Petersson said.
He said it was possible that the investigation would be closed without a prosecution. That could happen, for example, if the suspect were already dead.
The prosecutor's comments triggered renewed speculation about the killer's identity and whether Petersson has been able to unearth new evidence after so many years - potentially the gun used in the murder, which has never been found.
Palme, a Social Democrat, was Sweden's prime minister between 1969 and 1976 and again between 1982 and 1986. Hated by conservatives for his anti-colonial views and criticism of the United States, some Swedes even believed he was a KGB spy.
His murder has been variously blamed on Kurdish separatists, the South African security services and the Yugoslav secret police as well as a right-wing cabal in Sweden.
A petty criminal, Christer Pettersson, with a previous conviction for stabbing a man dead with a bayonet, was found guilty in 1989 of Palme's murder only to be freed on appeal. He died in 2004."
737,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 08:57AM ET</span>",Iranian 'action man' sets sights on parliament,"By Parisa Hafezi
DUBAI (Reuters) - Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf's record as a Revolutionary Guards air force commander, a war veteran and a national police chief has endeared him to Iran's supreme leader and boosted his chances of becoming the next speaker of parliament after Friday's election.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose grip on power is being challenged by mounting pressure from Washington and by growing discontent at home, is seen by analysts as counting on security hawks like Qalibaf to form a loyal and compliant parliament. 
The Guardian Council, a hardline body that vets candidates, has all but ensured the parliamentary vote will usher in a majority of Khamenei loyalists by disqualifying moderates and leading conservatives from standing. 
""Today our problem is the economy and we need jihadi managers like Qalibaf to overcome economic problems,"" Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards aerospace unit, said in a strong video message of support posted on Iranian websites. 
The vote for the 290-seat assembly - the first since Washington quit an international nuclear pact with Iran and reimposed crippling sanctions - will test support for the clerical establishment ahead of presidential elections next year.
Qalibaf's chances of becoming speaker hinge on gaining the trust of hardliners, who struggled for days to reach consensus on a single slate for Tehran. Hardliners could still nominate a rival as speaker in coming months. 
""Hardliners are very divided ... moderates and independent candidates will not vote for Qalibaf,"" said a former reformist official on condition of anonymity. ""It will be a very chaotic parliament with different groups of hardliners."" 
A NO-NONSENSE CANDIDATE 
Ahead of the election, Qalibaf has tried to win over middle- and lower-income voters by focusing on the economic hardships caused in large part by U.S. sanctions and by promising to tackle vested interests.
Some doubt that parliament is capable of bringing about change as Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guards determine the overall direction of the country by controlling the media, the armed forces, the intelligence services and most financial resources. 
""Nothing can change under this establishment. It does not matter who wins this election,"" said Ramin Sardari, 28, a jobless university graduate in Tehran. 
Qalibaf, who ran unsuccessfully in two presidential races and was forced to drop out of a third to avoid splitting the hardline vote, has revived his political ambitions by standing for parliament.
In 2005, he resigned from the military to run for president. He was seen as a strong contender but lost in the final days when Khamenei and his allies switched allegiance to hardline populist Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Qalibaf went on to win Ahmadinejad's job as mayor of Tehran, a post he held for 12 years. He won a reputation as a pragmatic problem-solver, tackling Tehran's acute infrastructure crisis and improving public transport.
But the capital's stubbornly chaotic traffic, his alleged involvement in a corruption case in 2016 and the deaths of 50 firefighters in a building collapse the next year damaged his popularity.
Despite that, many voters in Tehran still view the charismatic 58-year old, who leads the hardliners' list of candidates for Tehran's 30 parliamentary seats, as a no-nonsense candidate who can get the job done.
TOUGH ON DISSENT
Qalibaf's strong military credentials are expected to win over hardline candidates who share his background. At age 19, he first served in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a Guards general within three years and eventually commander of its air force in 1998. 
A year later, when a bloody crackdown on protesting students precipitated nationwide unrest and forced the national chief of police to resign, Khamenei appointed Qalibaf to the post.
To civil rights activists and reformers he is known as someone who crushed protests and personally beat demonstrators in 1999, and also played an active role in repressing unrest in 2003. 
Qalibaf was among a group of Guards commanders who sent a letter to then-president Mohammad Khatami, a reformist, threatening a coup unless he moved to end demonstrations.
In 2009, Qalibaf took credit as Tehran mayor for helping suppress months of bloody unrest that rocked the establishment after a presidential vote that opposition candidates said was rigged to secure Ahmadinejad's re-election.
Qalibaf has however sometimes upset his anti-Western hardline backers. 
He ran a flashy campaign in the 2005 presidential race, wearing a Western-style white linen suit and calling himself a ""Hezbollahi Reza Shah"" in reference to the father of Iran's shah, who was toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution.

738,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 08:37AM ET</span>","Haiti political morass fuels growing crisis of hunger, malnutrition","By Sarah Marsh and Andre Paultre
DESSOURCES, Haiti (Reuters) - Farmhand Celavi Belor has lost so much weight over the past year his clothes hang limply off his angular frame.
""Sometimes I go two or three days without eating,"" the 41-year-old said as he looked up from hoeing a rocky field in the mountains of northwestern Haiti.
The only food Belor, his wife and five children had to eat the day before was cornmeal, and now the only food left in their mud shack is a shriveled green chili and some stale beans.
""My biggest worry is one day I just won't be able to get up anymore,"" he said, his eyes sunken and unfocused.
While Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, has long had one of the world's highest levels of food insecurity, drought has ravaged harvests for the last few years, worsening food shortages and raising prices.
The northwest, one of the island nation's most remote and impoverished regions, has suffered the most.
A collapse in the gourde currency has put imported food - which supplies more than half the country's needs - out of reach for many Haitians like Belor, who earns just $0.40 a day when he can find the work.
Compounding that, anti-government protests sparked by anger over alleged corruption shuttered businesses and public institutions for three months last fall and disrupted the transportation of goods, including food aid.
By further stoking inflation and squeezing incomes, the peyi lock, as the standstill was known in creole, has tipped Haiti into a new hunger crisis.
One in three Haitians - around 3.7 million people - needs urgent food assistance, up from 2.6 million people at the end of 2018, the United Nations said in December. Haiti now ranks 111 out of 117 countries on the Global Hunger Index, in the company mostly of the poorest sub-Saharan African countries.
If immediate action isn’t taken, by next month 1.2 million people will only be able to eat one meal every other day in the Caribbean nation, the United Nations has warned.
""No-one has eaten yet today but if I feed my kids too early in the day they are hungry by night and cannot sleep,"" said Frena Remorin, 30, who lives down the road from Belor in the district of Dessources.
Sitting on a stool peeling manioc and bananas to boil over a charcoal fire, Remorin is struggling to find work washing clothes because few people have the money to spend.
""I don’t have enough money now for two meals a day,"" she said.
Donors who had hoped Haiti could rebuild as a successful nation after the country's devastating 2010 quake have been frustrated by the political instability and bad governance hampering development efforts.
With no authorized government or budget, Haiti now is not allowed to access certain funds from international organizations earmarked for it, further hindering its ability to respond to the food crisis. Foreign aid to Haiti's public coffers, which leapt after 2010, halved last year.
President Jovenel Moise is struggling to negotiate a power-sharing agreement to break the political gridlock. In the meantime, local authorities make do.
""This is the first time we've had it this bad,"" said Dessources district leader Jean Jacques Lebeau, 60, who receives $45 per month from the central government to help around 12,000 households.
SELF-SUFFICIENT
It wasn't always like this. Haiti was largely food self-sufficient until the 1980s, when at the encouragement of the United States the country started loosening restrictions on crop imports and lowered tariffs, then imported surplus U.S. crops, a decision that put Haitian farmers out of business and contributed to investment tailing off.
Add to this the effects of climate change: Haiti regularly tops the ranks of most vulnerable nations. This is partly because it is an island in the Caribbean, where hurricanes are getting stronger, but also because it has little infrastructure or resilience.
The real impact of the crisis will show in six months or so as malnutrition sets in, experts like Cédric Piriou, Haiti Country Director of Action Against Hunger, say.
Infant mortality already appears to be rising.
""If we had four children suffering malnutrition die before, now these last few months it has been six to eight,"" said Margareth Narcisse, 57, a doctor on the medical board of St Damien Pediatric's Hospital in Port-au-Prince.
The impoverished slums of the capital are, together with the Northwest, the areas worst affected by hunger.
In the malnutrition ward, three-year-old Dorvil Chiloveson lies on his side in a cot. He is suffering from severe protein malnutrition, known as kwashiorkor: his tiny body is swollen with edema, with patches of skin discolored and showing raw flesh.
""We couldn't go sell our harvest during peyi lock so we lost it,"" said his grandmother Marise Rose Dor, 41, who lives on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince.
After they ate their crop, all they could afford was rice with bananas from the garden. Instead of buying drinking water, they used a local spring they know is likely to be contaminated due to the absence of a sewage system in Haiti.
Many families told Reuters they could no longer afford tablets to clean the water or charcoal to boil it.
HELICOPTER CASH
The U.N. World Food Program (WFP), which alongside other international organizations assists Haiti's most needy, has scaled up operations in response to the crisis, sending food by ship or traveling by helicopter to hand out cash, given the resurgence of gang violence plaguing the roads.
The WFP estimated in November it needed $72 million to fund this emergency assistance to 700,000 Haitians for eight months but has raised only $15 million so far.
""Why should we bail the authorities out if they helped create this crisis?"" one Haiti-based European diplomat asked, adding that politicians were not being held accountable. ""How do we change that so that they hurt when people are going hungry?""
Humanitarian workers - and Haitians - beg the world not to turn a blind eye to the immediate suffering.
In Dessources, Belor says his children, who cannot afford schooling in a country where around 80 percent of education is private, are pale and listless now.
In the past, at least they could rely on the mango and breadfruit trees if they could not afford to buy food. But due to the drought, these are no longer producing.
Belor no longer even worships at his Baptist church because he cannot afford the clothes he feels he needs to attend.
""I live without hope,"" he said."
739,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 08:26AM ET</span>",Crisis drives Lebanese abroad in search of better future,"By Issam Abdallah and Alaa Kanaan
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Sick of Lebanon's political instability, Habib Rahhal had been mulling leaving since 2018 to seek a better future. But the final straw came in November when he was unable to get money out of the bank because of a national financial crisis.
He stepped up his job search abroad and found one in Germany. The digital product designer left Beirut for Berlin this month, intending to build a new life and joining a growing wave of Lebanese driven abroad by the crisis.
""Typically, if someone is leaving, you would be upset and try to persuade them not to. In Lebanon, it is the opposite... The first thing they say is ‘Congratulations!’,"" Rahhal, 27, said as he packed his bag. ""This is what makes Lebanese happy these days - leaving the country.""
Lebanon's economic crisis is widely seen as the most acute since independence from France and worse than any it endured during the 1975-90 civil war.
Long in the making, the crisis came to a head last year as flows of capital into the country slowed down and protests erupted against a ruling elite that has overseen decades of state corruption and bad governance.
Banks have imposed tight limits on access to cash and transfers abroad, the Lebanese pound has slumped and firms have shed jobs and slashed wages. The economy shrank by 7% last year, according an estimate by the former economy minister.
With no end in sight to the crisis, many people are considering where they might be able to go. Many Lebanese, including some of the most highly skilled, already have second passports, making it easier for them to leave.
Hoping for change, Rahhal joined the protests that erupted in October when the heavily indebted government tried to levy a tax on WhatsApp phone calls. But he did not pack the scarf he wore to demonstrations.
""I am turning the page,"" he said. 
Rahhal's brother already lives in Germany and his father lives in Nigeria. His sister is applying to emigrate to Canada and his mother also wants to leave.
As she saw him off at the airport, Rahhal's girlfriend said she planned to join him in Germany.
""Our future is going to be abroad,"" said Dana Nehme, 27. ""It is heart-breaking that we have to take such steps to continue our lives.""
Lebanon is already known for large diaspora communities in countries including Brazil, Canada and Australia in addition to many African countries, many of them descendents of Lebanese who left previous crises or conflicts in the area.
""Emigration has been part of the history of Lebanon, and authorities have not done anything to reverse or contain this trend,"" said Nassib Ghobrial, chief economist at Byblos Bank.
There are no official figures on emigration, he said.

""The concern is that the youth here, or some of them, consider there is no future for them in this country,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As the virus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship is evacuated, Japan faces deepening criticism over its response to the outbreak, tarnishing what was supposed to be a triumphant Olympic year for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
More than 540 people onboard have been infected with the coronavirus, the most outside of China. The United States evacuated more than 300 citizens from the ship on Monday, and more countries are following suit.
But as the crisis in the port of Yokohama winds down, focus now turns to Tokyo, where critics say the government's response has seemed more concerned with managing public perception than the outbreak. Some of the most pointed criticism has come from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which said the quarantine may not have been sufficient.
Japan is just months away from hosting the 2020 Olympic Games. For some Japanese, the outbreak carries an uneasy echo of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear meltdown, when the government was widely criticised for downplaying another crisis.
""The spread of the virus is wider than the government said,"" said Shinichi Niwa, an adjunct professor at Fukushima Medical University. ""During the (Fukushima) disaster, the government said there was no meltdown. So they hid the truth at the time, and I'm afraid the same situation is happening with the coronavirus.""
The health ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The government has repeatedly said its response has been appropriate, and some prominent doctors have defended it.
""Epidemiological evidence shows that our isolation strategy worked,"" Shigeru Omi, president of the Japan Community Healthcare Organization, told reporters at a recent briefing. ""Almost 4,000 people stay on this ship, which is not designed for isolation for several weeks, and this is a very challenging situation.""
The CDC praised Japan's ""extraordinary efforts"" in the quarantine but questioned whether they were enough.
""CDC's assessment is that it may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship,"" it said. ""The rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms, represents an ongoing risk.""
Passengers and crew on the ship will be required to wait at least 14 days after disembarking from the ship before travelling to the United States, the CDC said.
DANCING, QUIZ SHOWS
The British-flagged Diamond Princess arrived in Yokohama on Feb. 3 with about 3,700 people onboard after a man who disembarked last month in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus.
From the start, experts raised questions about the quarantine process. Unlike the United States, Japan does not have a central disease-control agency.
One Japanese infectious disease specialist who spent a day as a volunteer doctor on the ship has sharply criticised the quarantine, saying it was run by ""bureaucrats"" who stoked the crisis by failing to follow basic protocols.
Passengers weren't confined to their rooms until Feb. 5. The day before, as officials screened them, onboard events continued, including dances, quiz games and an exercise class, one passenger said.
Passengers also said that during early screening visits, Japanese health officials wore only masks, not full protective suits. The virus, SARS-CoV-2, was later diagnosed in two quarantine officers.
Meanwhile, the virus spread, most likely by people within their own cabins or by asymptomatic crew members interacting with passengers, experts said.
""How is this quarantine going to be lifted when there is practically continuous exposure?"" said Eyal Leshem, director of the Center for Travel Medicine and Tropical Diseases at Sheba Medical Center in Israel. ""It doesn't make sense epidemiologically.""
Japan also let people off the boat piecemeal, including those over 80 who tested negative, which experts said went against common protocols.
BELOW DECK
The contagion may have been fuelled below deck, where the crew of about 1,100 worked and slept in cramped quarters, sharing living spaces and bathrooms.
""The terror of the coronavirus is increasing at every moment,"" Indian crew member Binoy Kumar Sarkar said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Feb 7. ""I request the government to take us out of here and isolate us. We should be screened and isolated.""
Some have said Japan should have quarantined passengers on land.
""Quarantine on ship may be increasing risk of infection and creating a barrier to accessing medical care,"" said Esther Chernak, an associate clinical professor and director of the Center for Public Health Readiness and Communication at Drexel University in Philadelphia.
A Kyodo news agency poll on the weekend said 53 percent of respondents weren't happy with how Abe handled the situation.
""The Diamond Princess has proved a bit of a blind spot for us,"" a lawmaker from Abe's ruling party told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""But beyond that, there isn't a big problem for Japan with the coronavirus.""
Early on, the health ministry said cases on the ship would not count toward Japan's domestic tally of infections, in line with World Health Organization guidelines. But some experts said it also showed how Japan wanted to avoid the stigma of being seen as a virus hot spot.
""I like to believe that public health decisions were driven by science and not influenced by politics,"" said Mark Kortepeter, a professor at the University of Nebraska College of Public Health. ""But I am not naive, having worked in this space for decades. If that was the impetus, then it backfired."""

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland's constitutional committee said on Wednesday it has asked the Prosecutor General to investigate the legality of Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto's push to repatriate Finnish children from a camp in Syria and his handling of one director at his ministry.
The center-left government said in December it would seek to repatriate the children of Finnish mothers who traveled to Syria to join Islamic State and who are now being held at the al-Hol displacement camp controlled by Kurds in northeastern Syria.
But prior to that, Haavisto of the Green Party had sought to repatriate more than 30 such children but faced criticism from the opposition as well as from the Center Party, an ally in the five-party ruling coalition.
As conditions at the camp deteriorated in December, media reported that Haavisto grew impatient with one ministry director who opposed his plan for speedy repatriations without an official government decision on the matter.
Parliament's constitutional committee on Wednesday asked the Prosecutor General to investigate whether or not Haavisto had exceeded his powers in trying to reassign the director to other work.
""When the minister had already taken the tasks related to al-Hol away from the director, why was it necessary to continue preparing his reallocation to other duties?"" the chairwoman of the constitutional committee, Johanna Ojala-Niemela, told reporters.
If the Prosecutor General decides Haavisto overstepped his powers, the minister may have to resign, potentially destabilizing the five-party coalition.
The coalition has had a rocky first year in office with its first leader, Prime Minister Antti Rinne of the Social Democrats, forced to resign in December after six months in office due to widespread strikes and internal divisions within the government.
The coalition limped on after Rinne was quickly replaced by Sanna Marin - the world's youngest prime minister.
Marin quickly forged a compromise in which the government decided that each repatriation from al-Hol should be judged on its own merits, leaving the door open for some mothers to be repatriated with their children if necessary - a key dispute within the coalition.
The coalition remains fragile however, mainly due to the nationalist Finns Party riding high in the polls since soon after last April's parliamentary election in which it came second by a tight margin to the Social Democrats, who took 17.7% of the vote.
So far the government has confirmed the repatriation of two children from al-Hol."

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - As bakers in flour-stained clothes knead dough and slide trays of loaves into ovens in Sudan's capital, a cluster of yellow-vested volunteers keep watch.
The goal of the self-styled guardians of the uprising that toppled ruler Omar al-Bashir is to stem the smuggling of heavily subsidized flour and bread destined for citizens struggling through a long-running economic crisis.
Bread was a symbol of the revolution - an attempt to raise bread prices was a trigger for the first major protests, in the city of Atbara. 
But flour and fuel are still being siphoned off onto the black market, contributing to shortages that have dampened spirits six months into a 39-month transition and left a weak civilian government struggling to respond. 
""We are monitoring what enters and leaves the bakery - the flour before it is made into bread, the bread that comes out, who it goes to, at what time and why,"" said 20-year-old student Mohaned Babeker, standing watch at the bakery in the Khartoum neighborhood of Arkawit.
The volunteers have already caught wheat or bread being smuggled out of bakeries in Arkawit – in one case 2,000 loaves for sale at triple the price outside Khartoum, Babeker said. The culprits got a police warning. 
Bread is sometimes sold to restaurants at a 20% mark-up, a second volunteer said.
For the past two weeks, the volunteers have been entering their data on flour deliveries, bakery closures and smuggling into a mobile app being piloted in Arkawit. 
They hope to expand their activities to flour mills and distribution networks, and that the app will help reveal where smuggling and diversion of supplies is occurring.
""I think the fuel supply and the bread crises will be solved by collecting the right data,"" said Mohamed Nimir, a 31-year-old software engineer who developed the app. 
The volunteers, who work in shifts, are drawn from ""resistance committees"" connected to the movement that mobilized months of street protests before and after Bashir was forced from power last April. 
SLEEPING ON FLOUR SACKS
As the latest supply crisis led to lengthy fuel and bread queues over the past few weeks, they deployed at bakeries across Khartoum and beyond.
Trade and Industry Minister Madani Abbas Madani, who is responsible for bread policy and was a prominent figure in the anti-Bashir movement, has publicly thanked the committees for their work, tweeting pictures of volunteers including one who was asleep on sacks of flour, and both the ministry and the committees have said they will try to pool their efforts. 
The government has retreated from raising the price of bread, but Madani announced last week that commercial bakeries where bread can be sold at a higher price would be expanded from April, and that the size of fully subsidized loaves sold at 1 Sudanese pound (2 U.S. cents at the official rate, or 1 U.S. cent on the parallel market) would be cut from 70 grams to 42-48 grams.
At a bakery in Khartoum's Al-Riyadh district, some customers waved the smaller loaves, lamenting their reduced size. Owner Hisham Sharfi said bakers had faced rising costs and dwindling supplies of flour, and that the ministry should have set the size a little larger. 
""The citizen queuing who sees this loaf says this is small. It's better he pays 1.5 pounds for a big loaf, it's more credible,"" he said.
Suggestions that subsidies could be lifted have angered some, but opinions are split.
""My personal view is if the government removed the subsidy, it would (still) be better than the old regime coming back,"" said 55-year-old Salah Ibrahim, as he bought loaves in Arkawit.

The fictitious brother-and-sister duo, dressed in traditional attire and named after characters in poems by Mao Zedong, were rolled out on Monday as ""virtual idols"" in an apparent attempt to lift spirits as China deals with an outbreak that has infected tens of thousands of people and killed more than 2,000.
Many negative comments, some of which received thousands of ""likes"" on the Youth League's account on the Twitter-like Weibo, were removed during the day on Monday. By the end of the day, the post with the avatars had also been removed.
""Instead of spending time crafting the idols, I'd rather you make some real contribution to help with Wuhan,"" one person wrote in a Weibo post that has since been deleted, referring to the city at the center of the virus outbreak.
The administrator of the Communist Youth League's Weibo account did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on Wednesday."

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took a veiled swipe at China during a speech to Ethiopian business leaders on Wednesday, in an apparent amplification of U.S. criticism that Chinese lending for big infrastructure projects pushes poor countries into debt.
The Trump administration is seeking to counter significant Chinese influence on the continent with its new Prosper Africa trade and investment strategy and a newly established development financier, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation.
Analysts say the latter is Washington's attempt at an alternative to Beijing's sweeping Belt and Road initiative, which seeks to link China by sea and land with Southeast and Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
""Countries should be wary of authoritarian regimes and their empty promises,"" Pompeo said in his speech at the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa in the Ethiopian capital. ""They breed corruption, dependency and instability, not prosperity, sovereignty and progress.""
Pompeo's visit to Ethiopia was also designed to demonstrate support for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's political reforms despite sporadic outbreaks of political violence, said Kjetil Tronvoll, an Ethiopia expert at Bjørknes University in Oslo.
Ethiopia is due to hold an election on Aug. 29 and Abiy has promised will be free and fair in a break from decades of repression.
""Abiy is pleased with whatever international attention and recognition he can get ... to bolster his political standing and give legitimacy to his upcoming electoral race,"" said Tronvoll.
Abiy announced on Tuesday after meeting Pompeo that the United States would provide financial assistance to Ethiopia as it pursues reforms, but neither government announced details. [L8N2AI429]
Later a senior U.S. official said the U.S. had already committed $37 million to support the election, separate to the $1 billion that the United States was already providing in aid.
In his speech on Wednesday, Pompeo named American companies, such as  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Bechtel, as longstanding investors in the region.
He confirmed the United States was seeking a free trade agreement with Kenya, but offered no new information about negotiations that began earlier this month in Washington.
""If there's one thing you should know about our president - my boss - you should you know that he loves deals. He wants more to happen between the United States and nations all across Africa,"" Pompeo told business leaders.
While Pompeo was visiting Senegal, the first stop on his Africa tour, he announced U.S. firms had signed five new memorandums of understanding for infrastructure projects."
747,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 07:43AM ET</span>",Turkey's Erdogan says main opposition should be probed for Gulen links,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that the main opposition party should be investigated for possible links to the U.S.-based cleric accused of orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt, amid a bout of finger-pointing between the two sides.
Ankara blames Fethullah Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, for masterminding the abortive putsch and has carried out a widespread crackdown on his alleged supporters. Thousands of people have been detained, arrested or sacked over links to Gulen's network.
Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), said last week Erdogan was the ""political wing"" of Gulen's network, accusing him of allowing thousands of Gulenists to enter state ranks.
His comments drew harsh backlash from Erdogan, who in turn accused Kilicdaroglu of being involved with Gulen's network, which Ankara calls FETO.
""Everyone may have had a role in growing, strengthening and expanding FETO in Turkey. However, it is myself and the AK Party that declared them a terrorist organization and waged a war on them,"" Erdogan told his AK Party (AKP) on Wednesday.
""We struggled to remove the FETO elements in institutions, and we think that we still haven't been able to fully eliminate this scheme,"" he added. ""The state followed FETO everywhere, but it is clear that the CHP headquarters has not been examined enough.""
Gulen and Erdogan, once allies, fell apart in 2013 during a corruption investigation that briefly threatened to engulf the government, which Erdogan blames on Gulen's network. Erdogan's government also accuses Gulen of trying to establish a ""parallel state"" in Turkey.
Shortly after the 2016 coup attempt, Erdogan had said he had been ""deceived"" by Gulen and his network.
""I also met him (Gulen) in the past, there is no point in trying to hide this,"" Erdogan said. ""I accept that we struggled to explain the threat from this structure even to our very own circles. But we are the only ones who have relentlessly battled with FETO in a real way,"" he said.
Several attempts by the opposition to establish a committee in parliament to look into Gulen's political connections have so far been rejected by the AKP. Last week, Erdogan filed a 500,000 lira ($82,270) lawsuit against Kilicdaroglu for his comments.
Gulen has denied involvement in the coup attempt, in which some 250 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded. Routine operations against Gulen's network are still carried out across the country.
Rights groups and opposition parties have accused Erdogan of using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent. But the government has said the measures are necessary.
A prominent businessman was re-arrested hours after being acquitted on Tuesday over his alleged role in landmark 2013 protests, which posed a major challenge to Erdogan.
Osman Kavala was among nine people acquitted of an alleged role in organizing the Gezi Park protests.
Commenting on Kavala's acquittal, Erdogan said ""they set out to acquit him with a maneuver"". He later told reporters the new arrest order must be respected."

TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese infectious disease specialist has castigated his government's handling of quarantine on a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship, saying it was run by ""bureaucrats"" who stoked the crisis by failing to follow basic protocols.
Kentaro Iwata of Kobe University Hospital took his criticism to YouTube after he spent a day as a volunteer doctor on the Diamond Princess. The luxury liner has become an incubator for the novel coronavirus, with more than 600 people now infected.
The ship docked in Yokohama on Feb. 3. Japan has been criticised for its handling of the quarantine, including by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
But Iwata's criticism is some of the most scathing yet.
""The cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of the infection control,"" he said in his video. ""There was no single professional infection control person inside the ship and there was nobody in charge of infection prevention as a professional. The bureaucrats were in charge of everything.""
His English and Japanese language videos criticising what he saw inside have been seen more than 1 million times and forced a response from the government.
When asked about the videos and the criticism, the government's top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said staff on the boat were thoroughly protected from infection through the use of masks and hand washing. The government has repeatedly defended its measures as appropriate.
Iwata said in the videos that he volunteered to help out in the quarantine but was taken aback at what he saw inside. Against protocols that he'd followed in fighting Ebola, SARS, and cholera, there was no distinction between a green zone, which is free of infection, and a red zone, which is potentially contaminated by virus, he said.
He relayed his concerns to officials on the boat and was later told to leave the site, he said.
Iwata told Reuters that he could face professional repercussions for his public rebuke of the government. He said he posted the videos at the urging of his wife, who is also an infectious disease specialist and said it was his professional duty to get the word out.
""You don't want to hide the chaotic problem and risk to lots of people,"" Iwata said. ""You have to really do something about it."""

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Islamist al Shabaab militants killed at least 12 Somali soldiers and briefly captured a military base southwest of the capital on Wednesday, officials said, underscoring the insurgents' ability to launch attacks despite a government offensive.
A suicide bomber detonated at the El Salini base before gunmen stormed in and briefly occupied it, police said. The military recaptured the base after reinforcements arrived.
""They took the base and took weapons and ammunitions, this includes anti-aircraft guns fixed on pickups,"" said Nur Ahmed, a police officer from Afgoye in Lower Shabelle region.
Military officer Ismail Ali said 12 soldiers were killed and the commander of the base was injured.
Al Shabaab claimed responsibility.
""We took the base. We took two pickups with anti-aircraft guns hooked on. We destroyed four other military vehicles,"" Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab's military operation spokesman, told Reuters.
He said the attackers had killed 15 soldiers.

ANKARA/AMMAN (Reuters) - Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday a Turkish military operation to push back a Syrian government offensive against rebel strongholds in northwest Syria was now ""a matter of time"" after talks with Russia failed to halt the assault.
Turkish troops have already massed inside Syria ready to act and more were heading to the border area.
The Kremlin, which backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said a confrontation between Turkish and Syrian forces would be a ""worst-case scenario"" and Russia would keep working to prevent the situation from worsening.
Syrian troops supported by Russian warplanes and special forces have been battling since December to eradicate the last rebel bastions in Idlib and Aleppo provinces in what could be one of the final chapters of the nine-year-old civil war.
Nearly one million civilians have fled from air strikes and artillery barrages toward the frontier, overwhelming relief agencies and alarming Turkey, which is struggling to cope with the 3.6 million Syrian refugees already camped inside its borders.
Speaking to lawmakers from his ruling AK Party on Wednesday, Erdogan said Turkey was determined to make Idlib a secure zone even while talks with Moscow continued. Several rounds of diplomacy had failed to reach an agreement so far, he said.
""We are entering the last days for the regime to stop its hostility in Idlib. We are making our final warnings,"" said Erdogan, whose country has the second-largest army in NATO.
""Turkey has made every preparation to carry out its own operational plans. I say that we can come at any point. In other words, the Idlib offensive is only a matter of time.""
The Turkish leader on Saturday appeared to move forward the end-of-February deadline for a Syrian withdrawal from Idlib that he had previously stated.
Assad, whose family dynasty has ruled Syria for nearly half a century, has showed no sign of bowing to the demand, saying on Monday that his military gains presaged the eventual defeat of his foes. They include Turkish-backed rebels and jihadist militants.
An opposition military source told Reuters that 15,000 Turkish soldiers were now in northwest Syria after numerous convoys of reinforcements and weaponry had poured into the territory in recent days.
""You can't imagine the scale of Turkish reinforcements, half of Reyhanli is now full of Turkish commandoes ready to enter Syria,"" he said, referring to a Turkish border town. ""They are readying their forces for zero hour, operations are expected to start any time.""
WORST CASE
Ankara and Moscow signed an agreement in 2018 to establish a de-escalation zone in Idlib allowing both sides to set up observation posts. Since the escalation in the conflict, both sides have accused each other of flouting the agreement.
In Moscow on Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Syrian forces were upholding previous agreements but also reacting to provocations.
Kremlin spokesman Peskov also said: ""If we talk about an operation against legitimate Syrian authorities and armed forces, it is of course a worst-case scenario.""
Russia has a naval base at Tartus and an airbase at Hmeimim. Its war planes launched an air campaign in Syria in 2015, turning the tide of the war in Assad's favor.
The recent air strikes in the northwest have hit hospitals and camps for displaced people, the United Nations has said. Close to 900,000 people, most of them women and children, have fled their homes in dreadful winter conditions since December in the biggest displacement of the war.
In the past week the Syrian army has taken full control of dozens of towns in the Aleppo countryside and the M5 highway linking Damascus to Aleppo."

Najib, who was premier when MH370 vanished with 239 people on board nearly six years ago, was responding to remarks by former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott that Malaysian leaders had considered from the outset that flight captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah may have committed mass murder.
""My very clear understanding from the very top levels of the Malaysian government is that from very, very early on here, they thought it was a murder-suicide by the pilot,"" Abbott said in a clip from a Sky News documentary on the tragedy airing Wednesday.
Najib told online news portal Free Malaysia Today that Malaysian officials had considered such a scenario during their investigation but had chosen not to make their views public.
""It would have been deemed unfair and legally irresponsible since the black boxes and cockpit voice recorders had not been found and hence, there was no conclusive proof whether the pilot was solely or jointly responsible,” Najib was quoted as saying.
""Again I must stress that this possible scenario was never ruled out during the search effort and investigations, where no effort was spared.""
A spokesman for Najib confirmed his remarks.
Malaysia's transport ministry declined to comment. Authorities had previously said there was nothing suspicious in the captain's background, training or mental health, but did not rule out the possibility that the aircraft had been deliberately taken off course.
Najib said there were several reasons for authorities to suspect Zaharie's involvement, including his ownership of a home flight simulator and findings showing that MH370's transponders were switched off shortly after the plane left Malaysian airspace.
Flight MH370 became one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries when it disappeared on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014.
Malaysia, China, and Australia, called off a two-year, A$200 million ($130 million) underwater search in the southern Indian Ocean in January 2017 after finding no trace of the aircraft.
A second three-month search, led by U.S. firm Ocean Infinity, ended similarly in May 2018.
Najib lost a general election that month. He is now facing dozens of corruption charges over alleged involvement in a multibillion-dollar scandal at a state fund in which he has plead not guilty."

AÑELO, Argentina (Reuters) - Just weeks into his young administration, Argentina's new president convened a meeting with executives from  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX), Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L:RDSa) and other oil companies in a bid to smooth things over with an industry which he had slammed as a candidate months before.
Campaigning last year against the South American country's former market-friendly president, Alberto Fernandez had said there was no point in Argentina having oil riches if ""you have to let multinationals come and take it away.""
In a fence-mending session Jan. 16, Fernandez apologized to energy executives for the mixed signals, according to an industry source with direct knowledge of the meeting. Fernandez said he was intent on devising a recovery plan for the Vaca Muerta shale play in the Patagonian province of Neuquen, according to the source. 
But Fernandez did not present a plan at that meeting, nor put forward his own thoughts, the source said, a sign that the new government had yet to settle on a course of action for ramping the Western Argentine shale deposit up to its full potential.
""They know what they are supposed to do … but they don't know what changes will make things better or worse,"" said another official at a U.S. service provider who declined to be named, adding that he had ""zero hope"" that Fernandez's promised bill would significantly improve the bleak outlook at Vaca Muerta.
When asked about the government's plan for the area and the meeting with executives, a spokesman for the energy secretariat said, ""Vaca Muerta is central as a country project at a global level.""
The presidency declined to comment for this story.
The success of Vaca Muerta, often compared to the Permian Basin in the United States based on its vast potential, is key for this South American nation that has failed for decades to break free of cyclical crises and is grappling with inflation above 50% and a $100-billion pile of sovereign debt. 
But more than a dozen interviews with energy executives, property developers, analysts and locals here in Añelo, considered the capital of Vaca Muerta, show how patience is running out for global energy giants including  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) and Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) once committed to tapping the region's reserves, as well as the thousands of Argentines trying to scratch out a living in a region that was bustling just 12 months ago. 
When 47-year-old truck driver Alberto Valenzuela came to Añelo, a once-thriving town, seeking opportunity and a better life, he started building his dream: a four-bedroom home with plenty of space for his wife and two children. 
Now he and his family are moving on. 
""I came to try my luck,"" Valenzuela told Reuters. But now, ""we cannot provide for ourselves with what little there is in this town."" 
""NO LONGER A GOOD BET"" 
The remnants of Argentina's hope for a shale boom here can be seen on a dusty hilltop in Añelo, where Valenzuela is one of the 4,000 people who have helped double the town's population in five years. 
Weeds sprout around clusters of empty, half-built houses alongside idled construction equipment. It is one of the many construction projects aimed at accommodating newcomers that stalled as investor confidence slipped in the tumultuous election season.
Rather than presenting a plan for boosting investments in Vaca Muerta or other projects, Fernandez asked the executives who attended the January meeting at the Casa Rosada presidential palace for their ideas on how to stimulate the energy sector, the source with direct knowledge said. 
He pledged in the meeting to present a plan to do so in February, although there is no sign of it so far.
The executives asked the new president for a clearer legal framework, a right to send profits home, a reduction in red tape and the need to get rid of capital controls and a fuel price freeze, the sources said, measures enacted by Mauricio Macri in his final weeks in office.
For many in the industry, though, the damage from Fernandez's earlier broadside against oil multinationals is done. 
""We had assets we were going to send down there. After those comments, everyone in the industry felt that Argentina was no longer a good bet. That equipment is still not down there,"" said another source at a U.S. energy firm, who added that the diverting of assets was driven by Fernandez's campaign comments. 
Several key barometers of oil industry health have deteriorated in the region and work has gone with them in the last seven months, according to industry data and union officials.
By January, there were just 24 active rigs to extract unconventional oil and gas at Vaca Muerta, down 37% from the end of July, according to sector data by service provider Baker Hughes. 
While production at Vaca Muerta hit records last year, analysts attributed the performance to a strong first half of 2019 and said a slowdown likely began in August, largely because of that month's shock primary election result in which Macri was sorely beaten by Fernandez.
""In 2020, it's going to be affected. By how much, we don't know,"" Martina Gallardo-Barreyro, a Latin American energy analyst for Moody's, said of production and activity. 
The lull has hit international oil majors including Halliburton, which said in January that declining activity in Argentina had hurt its revenues. Rival Schlumberger is selling off parts of its local business amid what it has called ""muted"" activity and a difficult investment climate.
""HERE GROWS A DREAM""
The impact from the industry's Argentina crisis, which experts say stemmed from a lack of clarity on the rules of play as well as worries about the Peronist victory, is apparent on the ground in Añelo. 
A large hand-painted sign that reads ""will sell or seeking investor"" is mounted on the front of Valenzuela's unfinished house. 
Local officials tried to keep up with an influx that doubled the population to 8,000 within five years, but the town's development slowed to a crawl over the last seven months, entwined with the lower activity at Vaca Muerta.
Some oil majors and other stakeholders, including participants in the meeting, said in statements to Reuters they were optimistic that activity could still pick up at Vaca Muerta, citing its long-term potential.
German oil and gas company Wintershall DEA (WINT.UL), for example, said it had the ""clear expectation"" that price controls would be lifted in the short-term. 
Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said that a ""stable, predictable and competitive business environment based on free market principles is essential to attract investment capital on the scale that is needed to ensure growth and expansion for the Vaca Muerta, a world-class shale play with long-term potential."" 
But in Añelo, the picture is bleak. Packages of floor tiles lay in the dirt outside the unfinished structures of the hill-top housing development. Unused street lights are piled in a shed. Construction is well behind schedule with far fewer workers on the job, officials said.
In front of the empty shells of houses is a government sponsored sign that appears at many other dormant sites in the town. It reads: ""Here grows a dream.""

753,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 06:38AM ET</span>","In northern Syria, currency switch shows Turkey's influence","By Khalil Ashawi
AZAZ, Syria (Reuters) - Last month Hussam Shamo, a baker in northern Syria, stopped selling his bread in Syrian pounds after the latest slump in the currency forced him to push up prices yet again.
Taking his lead from the local council in his town of Azaz, which proposed ditching the Syrian currency when it slumped to one-twentieth of its pre-war value, Shamo started charging his customers in Turkish lira.
The move is a practical one. The Turkish currency is relatively stable and Shamo's bread now sells for a convenient 1 lira per bundle of flat loaves, instead of a fluctuating price in hundreds of Syrian pounds. 
But the switch to Turkish money is also another sign of Ankara's growing influence in a region of northern Syria seized by Turkish troops and their Syrian rebel allies more than three years ago from Islamic State fighters.
While Turkish and Syrian troops face off in neighboring Idlib province, the isolated rebel and insurgent-held enclave that is home to an estimated three million people, Turkey's presence in the Syrian border region further east quietly grows.
In towns like Azaz, al-Bab and Jarablus, taken over by Turkey in the 2016 military incursion, children study Turkish in school and Turkish universities are opening branches https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-turkey-syria-universit/turkish-university-to-open-campus-in-northern-syria-idUSKCN1J2243. Turkey has helped rebuild a hospital and train police https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey/in-schools-and-hospitals-turkey-carves-north-syria-role-idUSKBN1CH2A5.
Now Syrians in Azaz are paying for their daily bread, the gas to cook their food, clothes and even gold jewelry in Turkish currency after the Syrian pound, which traded at 47 to the U.S. dollar before Syria's conflict erupted in 2011, crashed through 1,000 to the dollar last month.
While the government in Damascus threatened jail sentences for anyone using foreign currency in commercial transactions, local authorities in Azaz took the opposite view, embracing what they saw as the safety of the dollar and the Turkish lira. 
""We were suffering in this region... from the rise and fall and the instability of the Syrian pound,"" Shamo said. ""The local councils in and around Azaz took this decision based on the reality that we are experiencing.""
Customers benefit from the new arrangement because the price of their bread is fixed, Shamo said, while the accounts at the municipal bakery are now more straightforward. ""We don't work with the dollar or any currency other than Turkish,"" he said. 
BAGS OF CASH
Other businesses in Azaz, which lies about four miles (six km) south of the Turkish border, have also started using Turkey's lira, including clothes stores and wholesalers. 
Goldsmith Fawzi Kano said the plunging value of the Syrian pound meant that so many notes were needed to do business that people were carrying currency around in garbage bags. 
""Adopting the Turkish lira is not a matter of rapprochement with Turkey, it's just that we are working to improve the economy,"" he said, adding that he would return to the Syrian pound if it showed signs of stabilizing.
Others see more political significance in the change. Ahmed Mustafa, a 35-year-old policeman, said using the lira underlined the support Turkey had given to the region. 
Turkey has sent troops into northern Syria three times since 2016, most recently to drive back Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters from Syria's northeastern border. 
The Syrian government describes the Turkish military presence as an occupation force and accuses Ankara of harboring colonial ambitions in the region. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey has no wish to occupy any part of Syria, but is trying to create conditions for some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees it currently hosts to return.
Mustafa, the policeman, said Turkish support had a deeper impact. ""Turkey is closest to us, and Turkey has protected us,"" he said. ""It is helping set up a state for us in the region.""

Facing a wave of protests and civil unrest that has claimed the life of almost 500 people since Oct. 1, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi quit in November. He has stayed on as a caretaker, but says now he's ready to leave, which would create an unprecedented political vacuum at the top of the government.
""It would not be correct or appropriate for me to remain in power after March 2, and I will have no recourse but to implement the text of the constitution and the cabinet's internal bylaws,"" said Abdul Mahdi, who has already stopped chairing weekly cabinet meetings.
It took Iraq's political leadership until Feb. 1 to agree on Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi to replace Abdul Mahdi, missing a constitutional deadline to appoint one within 15 days of his resignation.
Allawi now takes over a government tasked with organizing early elections. The constitution gives him 30 days -- until March 2 -- to present a cabinet to parliament for approval.
He has made little progress as rival political factions squabble over ministerial portfolios. But on Saturday he said he would form a government within the coming week."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China has revoked the press credentials of three journalists of the Wall Street Journal after the newspaper declined to apologize for a column with a headline calling China the ""real sick man of Asia"", the foreign ministry said on Wednesday. 
Spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing made ""stern representations"" to the paper over the Feb. 3 column, which China criticized as racist and denigrating its efforts to combat a coronavirus epidemic, but the paper had failed to apologize or investigate those responsible. 
""The Chinese people do not welcome media that publish racist statements and maliciously attack China,"" Geng told a daily briefing.
""In light of this, China has decided to revoke the press cards of the three Wall Street Journal correspondents in Beijing, starting today.""
He did not identify the journalists. The Wall Street Journal said its deputy bureau chief, Josh Chin, and reporters Chao Deng and Philip Wen, had been ordered to leave within five days. Chin and Deng are U.S. citizens and Wen is Australian.
In a statement, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China expressed ""deep concern and strong condemnation"" over the move. 
""The action taken against the Journal correspondents is an extreme and obvious attempt by the Chinese authorities to intimidate foreign news organizations by taking retribution against their China-based correspondents,"" it said.
China's step comes after the United States said on Tuesday it would begin treating five Chinese state-run media entities with U.S. operations the same as foreign embassies.
Among these are the Xinhua news agency, China Global Television Network and China Daily Distribution Corp, which will be required to register employees and U.S. properties with the State Department. 
Geng said China opposed the new rules and Beijing reserved the right to respond. 
China declined to renew credentials of another Wall Street Journal reporter last year.
A person with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters at the time that officials at China's foreign ministry, which accredits foreign journalists, had expressed displeasure at a story co-written by the reporter.
The June 30 report said Australian authorities were looking into the activities of one of President Xi Jinping's cousins as part of investigations into organized crime, money laundering and alleged Chinese influence-peddling. 

Foreigners are not allowed to work as journalists in China without official credentials, which are required to obtain a residence visa.

757,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",Italy government wins lower house confidence vote on new motorway rules,"By Giuseppe Fonte
ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government on Wednesday won a confidence vote in the lower house of parliament on a decree which includes new rules that make it easier and less costly for the state to revoke motorway concessions.
The move comes as the ruling coalition considers withdrawing infrastructure group Atlantia's license after a bridge operated by its motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia collapsed in August 2018, killing 43 people.
Atlantia has always denied wrongdoing in the disaster and says it will challenge any revocation in the courts, opening the way for a potentially long and costly legal battle.
The coalition won the vote by 315 to 221. A government calls a confidence vote to sweep away opposition amendments and speed legislation into law. If it loses such a vote, it must resign.
While the government easily controls the lower house, it has a much smaller majority in the upper house Senate and will almost certainly have to hold a confidence vote there too by the end of February if it wants the decree to become law.
The proposed new motorway rules have caused friction within the increasingly fragile coalition, which is deeply split over an array of issues, such as justice reform and migrant rights.
The small, centrist Italia Viva party, headed by former prime minister Matteo Renzi, complained that changing the rules for Atlantia mid-contract might scare away foreign investors.
The party finally agreed to back the measure rather than bring down the government over the question, but the coalition could yet collapse before the expected Senate vote.
Autostrade has said that the final approval of the decree would create the conditions for an automatic termination of its concession contract and result in a potential multi-billion euro payment by the government.
Rome denies that the new rules will automatically curtail the previous accord.
The new motorway rules say that if the concession is revoked due to shortcomings on the part of the operator, the state will have to pay the company only the value of the investments made in the highway network net of depreciation.
Financial sources estimate that figure might amount to 6-8 billion euros ($6.5-$8.7 billion) compared to 23 billion euros that Atlantia might have been due if the government had unilaterally walked away from the original contract.
Transport Minister Paola De Micheli suggested last month that any eventual payout under the new rules could be further reduced by an amount equal to the damages due for alleged mismanagement over the bridge disaster.
The decree also freezes increases in motorway tolls for 22 of the country's 26 operators, including Autostrade, until they accept stricter tariff rules laid out by the transport authority."
758,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",Westminster bells to ring out for Prince Andrew's 60th birthday despite controversy,"LONDON (Reuters) - The bells of London's Westminster Abbey will ring out for Prince Andrew's 60th birthday on Wednesday even though he has stepped down from public life following a backlash about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The birthdays of senior members of the royal family, including Andrew's, are traditionally celebrated with bell ringing at the Abbey, the site of coronations, weddings, burials and for famous Britons. The bells will chime at 13:00 GMT.
""Westminster Abbey is a Royal Peculiar and the bells are rung for the birthdays of HM The Queen and HRH The Duke of Edinburgh; their children; and TRH The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children,"" the Abbey said in a statement.
Andrew, Queen Elizabeth’s second son, stopped carrying out royal duties last year after an interview over his friendship with the late U.S. financier Epstein, who was found dead in prison last year while awaiting charges of trafficking minors.
Andrew has denied an accusation by a woman who said she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with his friends, including the prince, when she was 17.
But there was a public outcry after he gave an interview, where he failed to adequately explain why he did not cut off ties with his friend earlier, or express much empathy with Epstein’s alleged victims.
A U.S. prosecutor said last month Andrew had provided ""zero co-operation"" to the investigation into Epstein’s activities.
Government buildings will no longer be required to fly the British national flag to mark Prince Andrew's birthday, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said.
The buildings are usually required to fly the flag on the birthdays of the Queen, her husband the Duke of Edinburgh and their children."

SEOUL (Reuters) - Politics in South Korea is drawing high-profile North Korean defectors in numbers not seen before, aiming to remedy what they call failures by President Moon Jae-in's administration to protect refugees from the North.
Two defectors have entered the fray for parliamentary elections in April as candidates of the main conservative opposition party, and about 200 launched a party this week that vows to counter Moon's policies. [nL4N2AH28L]
Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean diplomat who defected in 2016, and Ji Seong-ho, whom U.S. President Donald Trump invited to Washington in 2018 to attend his State of the Union address, have both said they aim to amplify the voices of defectors.
""Regardless of whether they win the election, the defectors' growing participation in politics could raise the need for discussions about how South Korean society represents them,"" said Lee Nae-young, a professor at Korea University in Seoul. 
In recent years, defector groups have complained that Moon's administration was cutting funding, ignoring human rights, suppressing anti-Pyongyang activism, and sidelining prominent voices such as Thae, who once worked at a government think tank.
The complaints boiled over last year, when South Korea decided to forcibly repatriate without trial two North Korean sailors suspected of killing 16 fishermen, and many were upset at the apparent hunger deaths of a young defector and her son. 
""This is very wrong, even if they are criminals,"" Thae told a news conference in Seoul on Wednesday.
""If someone is shouting in the river 'Save me!'...will you judge whether he is a criminal or not? If he is a criminal, will you give up your efforts and let them die in the river? No!""
The government had maintained at the time that the sailors were criminals who could pose a threat to society. 
Seoul's Unification Ministry has said it is pushing to improve settlement programs for defectors, adopting measures this week to boost job opportunities and embrace them into South Korean society. 
PROTECTION FOR DEFECTORS
For the disabled Ji, 37, the trigger moment dates to May 2018, when a group of seven defectors he had been helping to bring to South Korea was caught in China, and he tried to secure their release.
South Korean diplomats were unhelpful, so Ji turned to officials at the White House, whom he had met while attending Trump's speech just months earlier.
Even though the Americans were involved in talks at the time that would lead to the first summit between Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, they helped Ji win the release of the defectors in a way that South Korea had not. [nL4N29V067]
""That's the moment I realized why it is important to elect a good leader and how politics matter,"" Ji told Reuters. 
Ji visited on Tuesday the newly opened office of a lawmaker's former aide, Kim Soo-chul, who is now running in the election, to greet voters and introduce himself. 
He hopes to lay the legal groundwork for more realistic settlement programs for the 33,500-strong defector community, while advocating for underprivileged people, including South Koreans with disabilities.  

""Without an arm and a leg, I am the symbol of North Korea human rights,"" Ji said. ""And as a young, disabled man, I can bridge the South and North, the young and older generations, and those who have disabilities and those who don't.""

761,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 05:19AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Myanmar set to be placed on global money laundering watchlist - sources,"By Tom Allard
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Myanmar is set to be placed on a watchlist by a global finance watchdog this week, amid concerns of money-laundering by transnational drug traffickers and weak regulation of its financial system, two sources familiar with deliberations said.
A decision to put Myanmar on the ""gray list"" by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) would mean the inter-governmental body had found ""strategic deficiencies"" in the country's ability to counter money-laundering and terrorism financing.
While being on the list does not carry any sanctions, it could curtail the growth of financial, investment and trade flows to and from the Southeast Asian nation, a high-level official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.
Kyaw Win Thein, the head of Myanmar's Financial Intelligence Unit who is attending the FATF meeting in Paris this week, told Reuters that Myanmar ""is not on the gray list so far"". Its fate will be decided at a plenary meeting on Thursday, he said.
The FATF typically announces its decisions on Friday at the end of its Paris plenary meetings.
Kyaw added that Myanmar's government has developed a strategic implementation plan to improve its ability to counter-money laundering.
He declined to elaborate but Myanmar recently introduced new requirements for companies to disclose beneficial ownership, and for banks to undertake better customer due diligence. It has also passed laws legalizing its casinos after concerns unregulated gaming establishments were being exploited by transnational crime groups.
Two sources with knowledge of the FATF's proceedings and its investigation into Myanmar said the watchdog found that implementation of the nation's anti-money laundering action plan was far from complete and it was on track to be put on the gray list at the meetings this week.
Myanmar lies at the heart of the ""Golden Triangle"" region, the epicenter of illicit drug production and trafficking in the Asia-Pacific. It also has ""significant"" problems with illegal jade mining, arms trafficking and logging, among other offences, an FATF report in 2018 found.
""Myanmar faces extremely high levels of proceeds-generating crimes"" and was ""exposed to a large number of very significant money laundering threats"", the report said.
The report also noted that the ""activities of large-scale transnational crime groups"" were ""closely related"" to ethnic armed groups which control swathes of Myanmar's territory.
Myanmar's government is in peace talks with most of those groups and some have been incorporated into Border Guard Forces allied to the country's military.
Meanwhile, corruption remains a ""very significant challenge"" in Myanmar while its state-owned financial institutions and enterprises were ""poorly governed and weakly regulated"", the report added.
Twelve countries are on the FATF's gray list. Myanmar's expected inclusion on the list follows its first evaluation by the FATF since the watchdog changed its assessment methodology in 2012."

Turkey and Russia back opposing sides in the nine-year-old Syrian conflict but have collaborated toward finding a political solution to end it.
However, a Syrian government offensive in Idlib has upset the fragile cooperation after 13 Turkish troops were killed in Syrian attacks earlier this month.
Ankara has urged Moscow, which backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, to stop the attacks in Idlib, saying the offensive was causing a migrant wave toward Turkey, which currently hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees.
Erdogan has previously said Turkey may use military force to drive back Syrian forces unless they pull back by the end of the month.
Speaking to lawmakers from his ruling AK Party, Erdogan said Turkey was determined to make Idlib a secure zone ""no matter the cost"", even as talks continue with Russia. Several rounds of talks with Moscow had failed to reach an agreement, he said.
""We are entering the last days for the (Syrian) regime to stop its hostility in Idlib. We are making our final warnings,"" Erdogan said. ""We did not reach the desired results in our talks (with Russia). The talks will continue, but it is true that we are far from meeting our demands at the table,"" he said.
""Turkey has made every preparation to carry out its own operational plans. I say that we can come at any point. In other words, the Idlib offensive is only a matter of time.""
Ankara and Moscow signed an agreement in 2018 to establish a de-escalation zone in Idlib, allowing both sides to also set up military observation posts in the region. Since the escalation of violence in the region, both sides have accused each other of flouting the agreement.
Turkish and Russian officials held several rounds of talks in Ankara and Moscow. The foreign ministers Turkey and Russia also met at the weekend, but failed to find a solution. Erdogan has said Turkey has given the Syrian forces until the end of February to withdraw from Idlib.

""We will not leave Idlib to the (Syrian) regime, which does not understand our country's determination, and to those encouraging it,"" he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - One of Hong Kong's most experienced judges has warned that a storm over the rule of law has ""broken out in full force"" in the protest-hit Asian financial hub, urging people to treasure the system.
In a rare comment, Justice Kemal Bokhary of the city's highest court, the Court of Final Appeal, built on a high-profile 2012 statement that a legal storm of ""unprecedented ferocity"" threatened the former British colony.
""If that storm broke out, I said, our judiciary would stand up in it - doing so with the support of our people,"" he wrote at the start of a recently-published legal text.
""The storm has broken out. It has broken out in full force. I remain confident that our judiciary will do its impartial duty.""
His remarks come amid fears in legal and diplomatic circles about pressure from Beijing's Communist Party leadership on Hong Kong's independent judiciary, as well as fierce criticism of some judges and their rulings amid sometimes violent tension that has gripped the Chinese-ruled city.
Student-led protests that began last June over a bill, now scrapped, to extradite people to mainland China have since morphed into wider demands, including full democracy. The unrest has led to three successive quarters of economic contraction.
Nearly 23 years since Hong Kong was returned to China under a ""one country, two systems"" framework, the judiciary is seen as one of the last bastions of its freedoms and autonomy.
The health of the system, which remains part of the British-based common law tradition, is widely seen as vital to the city's role and reputation as an international financial hub.
With thousands of cases pending, both pro-Beijing figures and anti-government protesters have criticized the courts.
Late last year some demonstrators lobbed petrol bombs near the Court of Final Appeal and sprayed graffiti on the High Court.
Bokhary wrote of divergent community views on who was ""to blame for the blows now being rained down on the rule of law"".
""What a court does in any given case may be as unwelcome to one section of the community as it is welcome to another,"" he said in the comments, dating from October.
Making ""wild allegations"" against the court harmed the rule of law, he added.
Bokhary's remarks figure in a brief preface to the 2020 edition of the leading work on Hong Kong's criminal law and practice, a 2,081-page volume known as Archbold Hong Kong.
Published in December by Sweet & Maxwell, part of Thomson Reuters, the book has circulated more widely in recent months.
Bokhary has served as its editor-in-chief for the last decade but has not been as strident in previous editions.
Although he retired in 2012 from his role as a full-time judge on the court, Bokhary remains a non-permanent judge.
Contacted by Reuters, he declined to elaborate on precisely what inspired his warning, but added he was confident that Hong Kong's judiciary could withstand the storm he described.
Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma, who heads the court, declined to offer any comment on Reuters' enquiry.
In a rare speech last month, Ma urged efforts to protect Hong Kong's legal system, saying that once it was damaged, ""This is not something from which our community can easily recover.""
Prominent commercial lawyer and commentator Kevin Yam said the remarks had raised eyebrows in legal circles but showed that, despite widespread concern, Hong Kong's judicial independence was being staunchly defended.
""We can see at least there are a lot of people working hard to hold the line,"" he said."

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Authorities in Indian Kashmir are cracking down on virtual private network (VPN) apps used to circumvent a months-long ban on social media, police said, as part of a broader effort to quell unrest over the withdrawal of the region's autonomy.
Social networks such as Facebook (O:FB), WhatsApp and Instagram are still blocked, even after the government restored limited mobile data service and the internet in Kashmir, so residents use VPNs or proxy servers to bypass the restrictions.
Police said many VPN users were trying to stir trouble in Kashmir and were liable to face action. 
""We have identified 100 social media users and are in the process of identifying more users for misuse of social media, for disseminating fake and false secessionist, anti-India propaganda,"" said Kashmir cyber police chief Tahir Ashraf.
Police have filed a case against social media users who are using proxy servers to access messaging networks and stir up anti-India propaganda, a spokesman said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked special privileges from Muslim-majority Kashmir in August in a bid to draw the region closer to India and end a 30-year revolt. 
It detained hundreds of people and imposed a communications blackout, saying the actions were needed to prevent people from organizing street protests. On Wednesday, security forces killed three militants in the Tral area of Kashmir.
Through VPNs, users can route the data connection of a smartphone or a laptop through a private server instead of the local internet service provider's network. That allows the user to access sites that are locally blocked.
Adil Altaf, 37, a businessman in Kashmir's main city, Srinagar, said he had downloaded a dozen VPN apps on his cellphone. 
""They go on blocking, I will go on shifting to other VPNs,"" he said. 
Saleema Jan, who lives in Kashmir, said she had used a proxy server for a video chat with to her son, who is in college in the northern Indian city of Chandigarh. 
Modi's government has frequently curbed access to the internet in Kashmir and other parts of the country, including briefly in the capital, New Delhi, amid growing protests against a new citizenship law.
As of 2018, India led the world in internet shutdowns, according to a report by internet advocacy group Access Now, accounting for 67% of the total recorded worldwide.
A Jammu and Kashmir telecom official said teams of software engineers were working to disrupt VPNs use in Kashmir.

769,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 04:19AM ET</span>",Kazakh opposition group to protest over harassment,"ALMATY (Reuters) - A Kazakh opposition group on Wednesday called for public protests after accusing the authorities of detaining dozens of its supporters in order to prevent them from setting up a new political party ahead of a parliamentary election next year.
The new party could become the only real opposition group to run for parliament which has for years been dominated by the ruling Nur Otan party.
Some analysts expected oil-rich Kazakhstan to allow more political competition under President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev who succeeded veteran ruler and Nur Otan leader Nursultan Nazarbayev last year.
But activist Zhanbolat Mamay, who has led the efforts to create a new political party, said many of its supporters will be unable to attend the convention planned this week.
""Due to large-scale pressure on the Democratic Party, mass harassment and human rights violations, and a blatant attempt by the authorities to disrupt the founding congress of the Democratic Party we announce that the Feb.22 congress is being canceled,"" political activist Zhanbolat Mamay told reporters.
""Instead, party supporters are going to hold a rally"", Mamay said, adding that police have detained dozens of the group's supporters.
The rally - which Mamay said would become the first in a series of public protests - is set to take place in Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, just hours before another opposition group's gathering.
Public protests not sanctioned by the authorities are illegal in Kazakhstan and are often dispersed by police, although the authorities have become slightly more lenient under Tokayev."
770,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>","Indonesia bill on family targets surrogacy, 'sexual deviations'","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Politicians from four Indonesian parties are backing a so-called ""Family Resilience"" bill that would outlaw surrogacy and require LGBT people to seek treatment at rehabilitation centers, prompting outrage on social media and criticism from activists.
Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority country, is seeing a shift towards greater conservativism including growing state and public hostility against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.
One of the bill's proponents, Ledia Hanifa of the opposition Prosperous Justice party, a conservative Islamic party, said in a statement posted on parliament's website that the proposed bill was intended to foster ""family-based development.""
According to a draft reviewed by Reuters, the family is defined as the smallest unit of society composed of married couples, married couples with children, and single parents.
The bill states that wives must ""take care of household-related matters"" and ""treat the husband and the child well.""
The bill is also seeking a maximum penalty of seven years in prison for surrogacy.
Under the bill, homosexuality, incest and sadomasochism are defined as ""sexual deviations"" and it wants people to report themselves to government-sanctioned rehabilitation centers for treatment.
The bill has been included on parliament's priority list for the 2020-2024 period, though proponents have yet to discuss it with the government's related ministries.
Parties supporting President Joko Widodo currently control 74% of seats in parliament so any bill would likely need government blessing to gain traction.
Supratman Andi Agtas, a member of parliament who heads a body overseeing the agenda of lawmakers, said a draft would be sent to the president before any deliberation between MPs and related ministries could start.
Fadjroel Rachman, a spokesman for the president, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Discussion about the bill has been trending on social media in Indonesia this week with many of the posts critical of the draft, which has also been condemned by rights groups.
""It's a very patriarchal bill and it will set back progress in gender equality and women's rights protection,"" Usman Hamid of Amnesty International Indonesia told Reuters.
Tunggal Pawestri, a gender rights activist, said the bill would be harmful for anyone who did not have a marriage certificate.
""What about those who hold traditional beliefs who can't register their marriages?"" she said. ""And also people who can't afford to register the marriages?"""

MURRURUNDI, Australia (Reuters) - For all the relief felt in other parts of eastern Australia as torrential rain in the past few weeks doused wildfires and filled reservoirs, the tiny township of Murrurundi, one of the driest places in the country, just can't seem to catch a break.
The struggling farming community of less than 900 people saw the rain falling in surrounding hills, and watched as the clouds passed by, but the three weeks of drizzle it has received was barely enough for families desperate to fill their water tanks.
""You can watch storms go straight around and you won't even get wet here. It gets frustrating. It makes you want to run up into the hills and see if you can bring it back,"" said resident Sally Roser, standing by the tank, buckets and containers she'd put in her backyard to catch what rain she could.
While the horrific wildfires that ravaged Australia in recent months ignited a national debate over climate change, the tinder for that argument was already provided by the three-year drought endured by rural communities like Murrurundi.
Back then, the Pages River ran dry, leaving little behind the dam that held the town's water supply.
Located 300 kilometers (186 miles) north of Sydney, Murrurundi was one of the first places to implement the highest level-6 water restrictions during a drought that has become one of the most severe on record.
Those restrictions, implemented in July 2018 and designed to cut water use by 85%, will likely remain in place until a new pipeline starts pumping water into the town's reservoir from a lake 40 kilometers (25 miles) away in the coming months.
For a map showing location of Murrurundi, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2262/2230/Murrurundi.jpg
DRIVEN TO DESPAIR
The town has survived for more than a year on water brought in daily by road tankers. Working six days a week, driver Mathew Byrne trucks in more than 120,000 liters of drinking water a day from the nearby town of Scone.
""The river hasn't run since 2017,"" said Byrne, relaxing in one of Murrurundi's three pubs shortly after finishing a delivery. ""There's no water going through the creek. It's pretty sad.""
Wendy Jackson, a reverend at St Paul's Anglican Church, said it had been a torrid period for the community.
""There have been awful tragic stories of people who have given up hope,"" Jackson told Reuters in the small, sandstone church where a couple of dozen residents typically gather on Sundays.
""I did a funeral for a gentleman here a few months ago who just became so depressed and became physically ill and he just gave up. He had to sell all his cattle. His wife is now still struggling on their place to keep it going.""
Jackson said despair overwhelmed another farmer whose herd was so underfed that he couldn't find a buyer.
""The farmer shot all the cattle, then shot himself.""
Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) says the drought is being driven, in part, by warmer sea-surface temperatures impacting rainfall patterns. Air temperatures have also warmed over the past century, increasing the ferocity of droughts and fires.
Fueled by drought-affected bushland, fires have struck like never before, claiming 33 lives and fanning a fierce political debate over climate change in coal-rich Australia.
Under pressure from environmental groups, scientists and the Australian public to address climate change, the conservative government recently acknowledged for the first time that the country must adapt.
Government forecaster ABARES estimates that the long-term higher average temperatures have reduced average farm profits by more than one-fifth, raising the prospect of more people being driven off the land.
Washing dishes at the Royal Hotel, a pub in Murrurundi, Gordon Simpson described how his old line of work dried up.
""First time I've had to work in the kitchen - I’m usually mustering cattle or fencing or something like that,"" Simpson said. ""There's no work because of the drought.""
He said the light rain might just be enough to get him out of the kitchen, if farmers needed someone to spray the weeds that were starting to grow."

FREETOWN (Reuters) - In his poem ""Rough Path"", Yousef Kamara reflects on his years selling drugs and stealing as the leader of a street gang in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown.
""Like a traveler in a rough jungle/Self propelling all alone/Edging through danger sharper than blades/My rough path is a cracked zone,"" he writes.
After quitting the gang three years ago, Kamara now hopes his journey to acclaim as a poet can offer an example to other wayward youths in Freetown, where increasing numbers are joining gangs modeled on the Bloods and Crips of Los Angeles.
Kamara has been published in several international poetry magazines and was invited last year to attend the African Writers Conference in Kenya.
It is a dramatic turnaround for someone who spent the majority of his life leading Giverdam Gaza, a gang of several dozen members he founded as a teenager on Freetown's Exodus Lane.
""If you were looking for some thugs ... to beat somebody up, you'd just rush down Exodus Lane and get the Giverdam boys to do the job,"" said Kamara, who stands about six-feet tall with short dreadlocks and large biceps covered in tattoos.
Tired of life on the streets, however, he began looking for an exit and found one through Way Out, a media studio founded by an English filmmaker in 2008 that encourages underprivileged young people to enter the arts.
Kamara decided to try his hand writing poems after seeing some of his friends enroll in a poetry course. He quickly took to it, tapping out verses on his beat-up cell phone.
""You need to give people ... something they can take back to their communities and say, 'I'm not the bad guy you used to know',"" said Gibrilla Kamara, no relation to Yousef, Way Out's office manager and a former member who spent much of his life homeless.
Kamara said he would like to establish his own organization to help vulnerable young people build self-esteem and shift ""from crime to career"".
The challenge is pressing. Across Sierra Leone, dire economic conditions, including runaway unemployment, have led many born after the country's devastating 1991-2002 civil war to join gangs, researchers say.
Kamara thinks poetry can be a powerful tool in combating that trend by forcing young people to be honest with themselves.
""When writing a poem, if you can be sincere with what you've seen, what you feel, what you've heard, you'll never need to fabricate any story,"" he said."

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Authorities in Pakistan are investigating if exposure to soybean dust, which can cause severe allergic reactions, is responsible for at least 14 deaths and dozens of illnesses in the southern port city of Karachi.
More than 200 people have been hospitalized or treated for breathing problems since Sunday as authorities try to determine if a leak of toxic gas was to blame, after many patients complained of an unfamiliar odor.
""While we are working on this complex bioanalytical problem, we think this may be due to overexposure to soybean dust,"" Pakistan's International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences told authorities in a letter on Tuesday.
Although it was still testing blood and air samples, the agency urged extreme care during the unloading of soybean containers at the port, adding that exposure to soybean dust had been known to cause breathing ailments and deaths.
Karachi Commissioner Iftikhar Shallwani told the Dawn newspaper that a ship offloading a shipment of soybean had been removed from the port terminal.
Many schools in the area were closed for a third straight day on Wednesday as the authorities investigate.
On Tuesday, several dozen residents of the port area staged a protest to demand an impartial inquiry into the deaths, and blamed authorities for not doing enough to prevent them.
Pakistan State Oil (PSO) is temporarily closing its storage terminal in the port area to help safeguard the health and safety of its staff, the country's largest oil marketer said.
The company would turn to backup sources to ensure the move did not affect 24-hour supplies of petroleum goods, it added."

The Gezi Park protests were a major challenge to then-premier, now president, Tayyip Erdogan and Kavala's acquittal, along with that of eight others, had been a surprise. Their trial, criticized by Western allies, was regarded as a test of justice in Turkey.
Kavala's re-arrest, over allegations that he was involved in a 2016 attempted coup, in turn prompted expressions of astonishment and frustration from foreign observers of his case, opposition lawmakers and rights activists.
""No way to believe in any improvement in Turkey if the Prosecutor is undermining any step ahead. Back again in dark period,"" the European Parliament's rapporteur on Turkey, Nacho Sanchez Amor, said on Twitter.
Emma Sinclair-Webb, Turkey director of Human Rights Watch, described the arrest warrant as ""lawless and vindictive"", bypassing a European Court of Human Rights ruling in December demanding his immediate release.
Police detained Kavala immediately after his release from a sprawling prison in Silivri, west of Istanbul, and took him to police headquarters after routine health checks, state-owned Anadolu news agency said.
During a 24-hour detention period, Kavala was expected to be sent to the prosecutor's office at the main court in Istanbul, a Twitter account run by Kavala's supporters said. Prosecutors will then rule on whether to formally arrest him and send him back to prison.
Kavala had been held in jail for more than two years over the Gezi case. He was accused of attempting to overthrow the government by organizing the protests, during which hundreds of thousands marched across Turkey against Erdogan's plans to redevelop a central Istanbul park.
The European Court of Human Rights in December demanded his immediate release, saying there was a lack of reasonable suspicion that he had committed a crime.
Kavala is now being held in relation to the 2016 coup attempt that Ankara says was carried out by supporters of Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Tens of thousands of people have been arrested in a crackdown following that failed putsch."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele deployed hundreds of soldiers on Tuesday to fight gangs, days after facing criticism for barging into Congress with the army to pressure lawmakers over his security plan.
The 1,400 soldiers will join about 8,600 already battling crime, an increase of about 16%.
In recent weeks, Bukele, who took office in June, has urged lawmakers to agree to a $109 million loan to help equip police and soldiers in the fight against crime in a nation racked by gang violence. He continued his push on Tuesday, delivering a fiery speech before hundreds of soldiers, complaining that legislators were delaying approval of the funds and accusing them of supporting criminals.
""These are difficult days in which you have decided to support and protect the Salvadoran people, days in which we know that most politicians are protecting criminals, days in which we know that deputies and former ministers financed the criminals that you are going to have to pursue and capture,"" Bukele said.
Bukele has faced criticism for his brief occupation of the National Assembly on Feb. 9, when he sat in the seat reserved for the president of Congress and cupped his hands together to pray as soldiers in full battle uniform looked on.
""Lawmakers are scandalized when they see a soldier, but they were not scandalized when gang members entered the Legislative Assembly to negotiate the lives of Salvadorans,"" Bukele said.
El Salvador’s murder rate has plunged since Bukele took office, but remains high.

Salvadoran soldiers have worked in security since the 1990's, though the practice is frowned on by human rights groups.

Lawmakers voted to increase the sentence for femicide to 45 to 65 years in prison, up from a range of 40 to 60 years. They also sought to toughen penalties for sexual abuse of minors to 10 to 18 years, up from six to 13 years.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Around 500 passengers on the virus-hit cruise ship quarantined off Yokohama near Tokyo were set to disembark on Wednesday, although those sharing a room with people testing positive would have to stay on board longer, media and officials said.
The Diamond Princess, operated by Carnival Corp (N:CCL), has been quarantined in Yokohama since Feb. 3 after a man, who disembarked in Hong Kong before it traveled to Japan, was diagnosed with the virus.
More than 540 people have been infected with the virus on the liner, which originally carried some 3,700 passengers and crew. Many of those infected have been transfered to hospitals. About half the passengers are Japanese.
Around 500 people were expected to disembark on Wednesday, public broadcaster NHK said, with the entire process completed by Friday.
The United States evacuated more than 300 nationals on Monday on two chartered flights and six South Koreans and one Japanese spouse flew to South Korea on Wednesday morning on a chartered flight.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday there were 220 Australians on board. A total of 169 Australians will be evacuated, 36 have been diagnosed with coronavirus and will remain on the ship, and another 15 have elected to stay onboard. Those evacuated will be flown to Darwin, where they will be quarantined for 14 days.
An Australian passenger said Australian nationals had been told they would be pre-screened starting on Wednesday morning and taken to Tokyo's Haneda airport in the evening for an expected departure early Thursday.
A captain's announcement on the liner said that Hong Kong passengers would also be evacuated over the next 24 hours and that according to information received, a Canadian charter flight would arrive on Friday morning, according to a tweet by a passenger with the handle @daxa_tw.
Italy and Taiwan were also preparing to evacuate their nationals.
Japan, which ranks second in the world after China in number of confirmed virus cases has come under fire for its handling of the cruise ship quarantine, although top government officials have defended the quarantine and onboard testing operation.
Besides those on the cruise liner and returnees brought home from China's Wuhan city, the epicenter of the epidemic, about 60 cases of domestic infections have been confirmed in Japan, including 22 in Tokyo, according to NHK public broadcaster.

Amid worries about a contracting economy, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to curb the size of public gatherings and some companies are telling employees to work from home.

Alias? ""El Chapo."" Occupation? ""Farmer."" 
The interview is part of a four-year-old video released this week which appears to offer rare footage of notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin Guzman, who is now under lock and key for life at a top-security U.S. prison.

The man in the images has the same haircut, features and build as Guzman on the day of his arrest, and his prison clothes and haircut match later images of the gangster behind bars.
Guzman’s arrest followed two earlier escapes - one via a mile-long tunnel from the same jail - that had humiliated the Mexican government. 
It was not immediately clear how Latinus obtained the video, or why it surfaced now. Mexico's security ministry did not respond to a request for comment on its authenticity, which Reuters was unable to independently confirm. 
Juan Pablo Badillo, a lawyer for Guzman in Mexico since 2014, said his impression was that the video appeared in line with the facts of what happened that day.
Guzman was extradited in 2017 to the United States, where he was convicted of trafficking tons of cocaine, heroin and other drugs as leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. 
After escorting Guzman inside Altiplano, guards searched him and shaved his thick mustache and mop of black hair, according to the photos obtained by Latinus.
Guzman then responded to a seemingly routine questionnaire: 58 years old. Primary school education. Mother alive. Pants size 34. 
And his wife's name? 
""The one I'm married to is Alejandrina Salazar,"" he answered, head bowed as he worked to clean the ink from his hands. ""But the one I live with is Emma Coronel."" 
The feared criminal whose nickname means ""Shorty"" in English proceeded to sign a document, tugging at his uniform to check the inmate number emblazoned across his chest. 
The footage of Guzman, who grew marijuana as a boy in Sinaloa state, shows his hands dotted with freckles and liver spots. 

Guards searched Guzman again before leading him to a bleak cell outfitted with a gray cement bench. They handed him a puffy jacket, a thin mattress and two rolls of toilet paper before locking the door.

He avoided prison in the case, but agreed to pay penalties of $1 million, serve two years of probation and testify in the trials against the former governor and the former governor's son, the Chronicle reported.

TRIPOLI/CAIRO (Reuters) - Libya's internationally recognized government on Tuesday suspended talks hosted by the United Nations to halt warfare over the capital after eastern forces shelled Tripoli's port, killing three people and almost hitting a highly explosive gas tanker.
The U.N. has been hosting in Geneva ceasefire talks between officers from the Tripoli government and the eastern-based Libya National Army (LNA), led by commander Khalifa Haftar. The two factions have been trying to take the capital in a near year-long campaign, displacing at least 150,000 people.
The talks had been agreed by foreign powers backing rival parties at a summit in Germany a month ago, an event that has not halted a war cutting oil exports by 1 million barrels a day.
Western countries have largely watched passively as Libya fell apart since helping remove Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, opening the door for regional powers such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey to back rival camps fighting for control.
The LNA on Tuesday shelled Tripoli port, saying first it had attacked a Turkish vessel bringing weapons but saying later it had hit an arms depot. Three civilians were killed and five wounded, the Tripoli forces said.
The attack came just as the U.S. ambassador Richard Norland was visiting Haftar in the first trip of a U.S. envoy to eastern Libya since the killing of the U.S. ambassador in a raid blamed on an Islamist militia in 2012.
In response to the LNA attack, the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord said in a statement it suspended its participation in ceasefire talks ""until firm responses are taken against the attacker, and we will respond firmly to the attack in appropriate timing.""
""Negotiations don't mean anything without permanent ceasefire guarantees returning the displaced people and the security of the capital and the other cities,"" it added.
Tripoli port is a major gateway for food, fuel, wheat and other imports for the capital, which is home to the internationally recognized government. Heavy artillery fire could be heard at night.
PORT STRIKE
State oil firm NOC said it had urgently evacuated all fuel tankers from the port after a missile struck meters away ""from a highly explosive liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tanker discharging in the port"".
""The city does not have operational fuel storage facilities ... the consequences will be immediate; hospitals, schools, power stations and other vital services will be disrupted,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in a statement.
Since January, Turkey has sent several ships carrying arms and heavy trucks to Tripoli and Misrata, another western port allied to the Tripoli government, diplomats say. It has also sent fighters from Syria's civil war to defend Tripoli.
The LNA is allied to a parallel government in eastern Libya supported by the UAE, Egypt, Jordan and Russian mercenaries. France has also given some support.
Eastern ports and airports are out of range of the Tripoli forces and its Turkish drones.
Tuesday's attack on the port unfolded as officers from the Tripoli forces and the LNA held a second round of indirect talks in Geneva to establish a permanent ceasefire. Both sides refused again to sit in the same room, U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame said.
Salame added that he had received conditions from tribesmen allied to eastern forces to lift a blockade of eastern oil export ports, but said these were quite general and would have to be fleshed out in more U.N.-led talks in Geneva next week."

The evacuees will be transferred and isolated for at least two weeks at Incheon International Airport Quarantine, to rule out any symptoms.
Health authorities had said there were 14 South Koreans, five of whom were crew members, on the Diamond Princess, including those who arrived on Wednesday's flight.

786,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 06:32PM ET</span>",Bolsonaro and son blast probe of Brazil hit man killed by police,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his son on Tuesday hurled criticism at state authorities investigating the death of an alleged hit man who was suspected of involvement in the murder of a well-known Rio de Janeiro councilwoman. 
Far-right Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, the president's eldest son, suggested alleged ""militia"" leader Adriano Magalhães da Nóbrega, killed earlier this month in a shootout with police, had been tortured in the leftist-controlled state of Bahia. 
He also shared a graphic 21-second video that appeared to show the autopsy of Nóbrega, a former Rio police officer.
""Forensics of Bahia (a Workers Party administration) say it is not possible to say whether Adriano was tortured,"" Flavio Bolsonaro wrote on Twitter, before describing alleged broken bones and burn marks on the corpse. ""Who is issuing fraudulent reports? To hide what? Who ordered the killing of Adriano?""
The Bolsonaro family has been under growing pressure to explain its ties both to Nóbrega, whose wife and mother worked in Flavio's office when he was a state lawmaker, and indirect links to the murder of slain Rio councilwoman Marielle Franco.
The two cases have been particularly sensitive for the president, who took office vowing to end years of grisly violence and corruption. 
The president also took to Twitter on Tuesday to question state officials' handling of the case, calling for an ""independent"" forensic investigation.
""Who will handle the forensics for Adriano's phone? Could they forge an exchange of messages and audios received? Could innocents be accused of crime?"" he asked.
The presidential press office declined to comment.
Nóbrega, one of Rio's most infamous alleged militia leaders, was killed on Feb. 9, after he opened fire on officers coming to arrest him, the Bahia state government said. 
The Bahia state government said he was sought in the investigation of Franco's 2018 death. The leftist councilwoman's killing drew attention to the growing powers of Rio's militias, criminal groups comprised of former police officers, who control local gas, property and gambling rackets across Rio state. 
Investigators said they had no reason to think any of the Bolsonaros were linked to Franco's killing, but the first family has nonetheless been dogged by questions about militia ties. 
After Nobrega's death, the president speculated whether the former cop's killing had been ""a tying up of loose ends,"" adding that ""there is no connection between me and the militia in Rio de Janeiro. Zero, zero."" 
Speaking at the same event, Flavio Bolsonaro said: ""There is no point trying to tie me to the militia because I have absolutely nothing to do with militia.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday said he was pushing a bill through Congress to allow commercial mining and agriculture on protected indigenous lands, as he met with tribal leaders to announce a credit line to support indigenous farmers who have developed soy plantations on their reservations.
The far-right leader, who has faced criticism for his government's failure to protect the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest, said the credit line would allow indigenous tribes to buy seed, fertilizer and machinery, even though large-scale agriculture has hitherto been illegal on their lands.
""Indigenous people cannot be stuck inside their lands like prehistoric human beings,"" Bolsonaro said as he met with some 20 indigenous leaders at the gates of the presidential palace.
Speaking with Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina beside him, Bolsonaro said the credit line would help lift Brazil's indigenous people out of poverty and assimilate them into Brazilian society.
The main organizations representing Brazil's 900,000 indigenous people say a majority are opposed to mining and commercial agriculture on their ancestral lands, however.
Bolsonaro's comments at the presidential palace came as Raoni Metuktire, a Kayapo chief known internationally for his environmental campaigning since the 1980s, joined other indigenous representatives in an appearance at Brazil's Congress on Tuesday to ask Speaker Rodrigo Maia to block the government's commercial mining and farming bill.
""Bolsonaro is clearly trying to create division between us, but the majority of us are represented here and is against the bill,"" said Sonia Guajajara, head of APIB, an umbrella organization of the indigenous tribes of Brazil.
""We do not want the destruction of the rainforest with mining and hydroelectric dams. I am against what Bolsonaro is doing,"" Raoni told a news conference.
Bolsonaro said his bill will allow indigenous people to mine and plant crops on their lands, and rent them to white farmers if they want to, which is currently illegal under Brazilian law.
Environmental laws also ban commercial agriculture and the use of transgenic crops on reservation lands, though three tribes were given a temporary three-year permit to develop large-scale farming that expired in 2018.
One of the tribes, the Parecis are farming 8,000 hectares of soy this season, and Bolsonaro plans to visit them during the harvest, a source at the indigenous affairs agency Funai said.
""We're here to show that there are indigenous people in Brazil who want to farm while keeping their indigenous culture,"" said Parecis farming manager Arnaldo Zunizakae.
He said his people want to produce wealth to improve their standard of living, through ""organized and responsible"" agriculture that preserves nature."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will prioritize access for high-skilled workers from around the world in its post-Brexit, points-based immigration system, the government said on Tuesday, setting out its plans to put an end to a reliance on ""cheap labor from Europe"".
Concern over the impact of high levels of immigration from the European Union was one of the key drivers behind Britain's 2016 vote to leave the bloc and the government has said it plans to bring overall migration numbers down.
The new system will assign points for specific skills, qualifications, salaries or professions and only give visas to those who have enough points. It will come into force from Jan. 1, 2021 and will treat EU and non-EU citizens the same.
""For the first time in decades, the UK will have full control over who comes to this country and how our immigration system operates,"" the government said in a policy document setting out its plans.
EU citizens will not need a visa to enter Britain as a visitor for up to six months. 
The Home Office said it would follow a recommendation made last month by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), an independent body which advises the government, to lower the minimum general salary threshold for skilled migrants to 25,600 pounds ($33,330) a year, from 30,000 pounds.
Skilled workers will need to meet criteria including specific skills and the ability to speak English, the government said, and those applying will need to have a job offer.
There will be no specific entry route for low-skilled workers, something the government hopes will help reduce the number of migrants.
""We need to shift the focus of our economy away from reliance on cheap labor from Europe and instead concentrate on investment in technology and automation. Employers will need to adjust,"" the policy document said.
The MAC estimated the impact of the government's planned salary and skills thresholds would mean around 70% of European Economic Area citizens who have arrived in Britain since 2004 would not have been eligible for a visa. 

Students will be covered by the points-based system, the government said, while there will be separate initiatives for scientists, graduates, National Health Service workers and those in the agricultural sector.

789,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 05:53PM ET</span>",Utah Senate votes to decriminalize polygamy among consenting adults,"By Jennifer Dobner
SALT LAKE CITY (Reuters) - The Utah state Senate voted unanimously on Tuesday effectively to decriminalize polygamy among consenting adults, reducing penalties for a practice with deep religious roots in the predominantly Mormon state.
The bill, which would treat the offense of plural marriage as a simple infraction on par with a parking ticket, now moves to the Utah House of Representatives, where it is likely to face greater resistance.
The bill swiftly cleared the Republican-controlled Senate on a vote of 29-0 with little discussion.
Under current law, polygamy - typically involving a man who cohabitates with and purports to marry more than one wife - is classified as a third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. 
If the Senate bill becomes law, punishments for plural marriage would be limited to fines of up to $750 and community service. 
However, fraudulent bigamy - in which an individual obtains licenses to marry more than one spouse without their knowledge, or seeks to wed someone underage without her consent - remains a felony.
The chief sponsor of the measure, Senator Deirdre Henderson, said the intent of the bill is not to legalize polygamy but to lower the penalties so those from polygamous communities who are victims of crimes can come forward without fear of being prosecuted themselves.
It also would make it easier for otherwise law-abiding polygamists to obtain access to critical services such as medical or mental health care, education or even employment without fear, she said. 
Opponents of decriminalization say the current law should not be changed because polygamy is inherently dangerous and harmful to women and children, particularly young girls, some of whom have been forced into marriages with older men.
REMNANT OF PRE-STATEHOOD
Polygamy is a remnant of the early teachings of the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose members fled persecution over the practice to settle the Utah territory in 1847. The church disavowed polygamy in 1890 as a condition of Utah statehood, and today members of the faith found to be practicing plural marriage are excommunicated. 
Fundamentalist Mormons, said to number more than 30,000 across the western United States, believe they are adhering to the truest form of Mormon doctrine, which promises polygamists glorification in heaven.
Utah’s history of felony punishment for polygamy has never halted its practice entirely but rather driven it to the fringes of society, creating a culture of fear that allows perpetrators to thrive, Henderson said.
“The solution to the problem is increased societal integration, which can only come through decriminalizing otherwise law-abiding polygamists,” Henderson said during a preliminary debate on the bill last week. 
Critics, however, say the measure wrongly frames polygamy as a human rights issue.
“Proponents of this bill attempt to piggyback on the success of the gay rights movement by promoting the narrative that this initiative is about consenting adults doing what they will,” the anti-polygamy group Sound Choices Coalition said in a statement. “This has nothing to do about consenting adults or gay rights. It’s all about weaponizing God.”
In 2013, Kody Brown, patriarch of the polygamist family featured on the “Sister Wives” television reality show, challenged the law after being investigated for bigamy by Utah County prosecutors. No charges were filed.

A federal judge struck down the anti-polygamy law as unconstitutional. But a federal appeals court reversed the ruling and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

The Paris prosecutor's office said Pavlensky had been released from a police station on Tuesday evening after having been brought in for questioning on Sunday.
Pavlensky, who has lived in France since 2017, faces charges of privacy violation.
His girlfriend was also placed under formal investigation, the prosecutor's office said, adding they were not permitted to contact each other.
Benjamin Griveaux, 42, a key member of Emmanuel Macron's LREM party, said last week he had decided to withdraw from the municipal election next month.
Pavlensky had claimed he had published screenshots of an online chat which he said was between Griveaux and a woman who is not his wife.
The chat included a video showing a man's genitals. Griveaux has not disputed that he sent the messages.
In France, a formal investigation may or may not lead to a trial.
Macron has since picked health minister, Agnes Buzyn, to revive his efforts to win control of the Paris city hall.
French politicians from all sides denounced the leak of private material, which many said constituted an unacceptable Americanisation of politics in France, where politicians' private lives have long been considered off limits.
Pavlensky is best known for works of performance art including nailing his scrotum to the ground in Moscow's Red Square (NYSE:SQ) and setting fire to doors at the headquarters of Russia's state security agency and the Bank of France."

Putin fired Vladislav Surkov, seen as a hardliner by many in Kiev, in a terse two-line statement on the Kremlin website. His sacking, which coincided with a flare-up in fighting in eastern Ukraine, had been rumored for weeks.
The decree was issued a week after the Kremlin said a senior Ukrainian-born Russian official, Dmitry Kozak, was now in charge of managing Moscow's relations with Ukraine, effectively sidelining Surkov.
Relations between Moscow and Kiev unraveled after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and Moscow-backed separatists launched an uprising in Donbass, eastern Ukraine, that has killed more than 13,000 people.
Russia denies any role in the conflict.
Moscow and Kiev are wrangling over how to implement a peace deal on Donbass, but major disagreements remain and full normalization is far off.
Alexei Chesnakov, a political analyst who used to work for Surkov in Russia's presidential administration, announced last month that Surkov had resigned ""because of a change in policy regarding Ukraine"".
""The decision was made by Surkov and will not change. I know it from Surkov himself,"" he said.
Another source close to Surkov told Reuters that Surkov had reacted sharply to Kozak's appointment."

Asked about the author, who is usually referred to in Washington as ""Anonymous,"" Trump told reporters outside Air Force One: ""I know who it is. I can't tell you that, but I know who it is.""
The identity of Anonymous has been publicly unknown since September 2018, when the initial opinion story was published in the New York Times, and through 2019, when the official published a book called ""A Warning.""
Trump, who has repeatedly railed against the American press, called for a Justice Department investigation into the New York Times and said he was considering taking action against the newspaper after the opinion piece was published.
Several prominent Trump officials, including U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Jim Mattis, who was secretary of defense at the time, have denied being Anonymous.
The anonymous author wrote that a bid to remove Trump from the presidency was dismissed to avoid a constitutional crisis and argued that Trump was amoral, warning that electing him to a second term would be ""courting disaster.""

Macron has so far stayed away from issues related to France's Muslim community, the biggest in Europe, focusing instead on economic reforms.
In a much-anticipated intervention less than a month before mayoral elections, Macron said he would gradually put an end to the system in which Algeria, Morocco and Turkey send imams to France to preach in mosques.
""This end to the consular Islam system is extremely important to curb foreign influence and make sure everybody respects the laws of the republic,"" he told a news conference in the eastern city of Mulhouse.
Macron said 300 imams were sent to France every year by these countries, and that those who arrived in 2020 would be the last to arrive in such numbers.
He said his government had asked the body representing Islam in France to find solutions to train imams on French soil instead, make sure they can speak French and don't spread Islamist views.
Macron, who is constantly attacked by far-right leader Marine Le Pen on the issue of how to integrate French Muslims, also said he would end the practice of French students being taught by teachers paid by foreign governments.
France has agreements with nine countries, including Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey, whereby their governments can send teachers to French schools to teach languages to students originally from these countries.
Macron said he had found an agreement to end the practice with all of these countries except Turkey.
""I won't let any country, whatever it is, feed separatism,"" Macron said. ""You can't have Turkish law on French soil. That can't be.""
France has suffered major attacks by Islamist militants in recent years. Co-ordinated bombings and shootings in November 2015 at the Bataclan theater and other sites around Paris killed 130 people - the deadliest attacks in France since World War Two."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A long-running dispute between Britain and Greece over ancient treasures has spilled into tensions over Brexit after a demand for the return of stolen cultural artefacts was added to the draft of a European Union negotiating mandate.
The British Museum in London has refused to return the Parthenon Marbles, 2,500-year-old sculptures that British diplomat Lord Elgin removed from Athens in the early 19th century when Greece was under Ottoman Turkish rule.
A draft of the 27 EU nations' position on negotiations with Britain on their future relationship, which was seen by Reuters on Tuesday, seeks the ""return or restitution of unlawfully removed cultural objects to their countries of origin"".
The document did not specify any cultural objects.
However, an EU diplomat said the line was added at the request of Greece, with support from Italy.
Greece's culture minister said last month that Athens would step up its campaign for the return of the Parthenon Marbles from London and expected to win more support from European peers as Brexit diminishes Britain's influence.
The British Museum says the marbles, which are roughly half of a 160-metre frieze that adorned the fifth century BC Parthenon temple, were acquired by Elgin under a legal contract with the Ottoman empire. Greece says they were stolen.
A British government spokeswoman, commenting on the draft EU document, said the UK's position on the sculptures remained that they are ""the legal responsibility of the British Museum"".
""That is not up for discussion as part of our trade negotiations,"" the spokeswoman said in a statement. 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson led the UK out of the European Union on Jan. 31, more than three years after Britons voted in a referendum to leave.
Rhetoric between London and Brussels over the terms of their future relationship has grown sharper this month ahead of negotiations that are due to start in early March. 
An EU source, who declined to be named because discussions on the negotiating mandate are confidential, said the reference to stolen artefacts was included in an earlier draft of the document last week.

The source said the reference also had support from Cyprus and Spain and that, Greece's concerns about the marbles aside, EU countries were more broadly concerned about the illegal trade of artefacts through London auction houses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday ramped up pressure on Venezuela, blacklisting a subsidiary of Russian state oil major Rosneft that President Donald Trump's administration said provides a financial lifeline to President Nicolas Maduro's government.
The U.S. Treasury Department slapped sanctions on Rosneft Trading SA, the Geneva-based trading unit of Rosneft, as Washington targeted Moscow over its backing of Maduro's government. 
The move further complicates already-fraught U.S.-Russian relations. Russia condemned the sanctions, saying they amounted to unfair competition and would not deter Moscow from continuing to work with Venezuela. Russia's Foreign Ministry said the move would further damage relations with Washington and undermine global free trade. 
Rosneft called the sanctions an ""outrage"" and said the company did not engage in any illegal activities, the TASS news agency reported.
U.S. officials accused the Rosneft subsidiary of propping up the Venezuelan oil sector and engaging in ""tricks"" and ship-to-ship transfers to actively evade American sanctions.
""I think this is a very significant step, and I think you will see companies all over the world in the oil sector now move away from dealing with Rosneft Trading,"" Elliott Abrams, the U.S. special representative for Venezuela, told reporters.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin added in a statement, ""The United States is determined to prevent the looting of Venezuela's oil assets by the corrupt Maduro regime.""
Abrams said Rosneft Trading now handles about 70 percent of Venezuelan oil. U.S. officials have warned companies worldwide about dealings with Rosneft Trading.
The United States in January 2019 recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the OPEC nation's legitimate interim president in the aftermath of Maduro's 2018 re-election that was widely described as fraudulent. Washington has ratcheted up sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Maduro's government.
Maduro remains in power, backed by Venezuela's military as well as Russia, China and Cuba. Maduro has overseen an economic collapse and the socialist president has been accused of corruption and human rights violations. His clinging to power has been a source of frustration for Trump, U.S. officials have said privately.
Along with the sanctions, the United States also issued a general license allowing companies 90 days to wind down their transactions with Rosneft Trading. Tuesday's sanctions freeze any U.S.-held assets of Rosneft Trading and the subsidiary's chairman of the board and president, Didier Casimiro, who serves as a vice president of the parent company.
Rosneft shares fell 2.7 percent, underperforming oil prices and the broader Russian index. The sanctions announcement came soon before the close of the Russian market. 
A senior Trump administration official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said, ""The global markets - oil markets - are adequately supplied, and so we think while this is a serious action, global markets will remain stable.""
It was unclear whether Tuesday's move will reduce export revenue flowing to Maduro's government, which continues to enjoy Moscow's backing in a stand-off reminiscent of the Cold War. Russia and China have called U.S. sanctions against Venezuela illegal. 
'DEEP DIFFERENCES'
The decision to impose the sanctions was cleared by Trump, a senior administration official said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday discussed the blacklisting with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the Munich security conference in Germany, the official said.
""Obviously we have deep differences over what is happening in Venezuela and what is the way out for Venezuela,"" Abrams said, when asked about Pompeo's discussion with Lavrov. 
Moscow has acted as a lender of last resort for Venezuela, with the government and Rosneft providing at least $17 billion in loans and credit lines since 2006, and has also provided diplomatic support.
Rosneft is the world's largest listed oil company by output. Through units including Rosneft Trading and TNK Trading it took more than a third of Venezuela's oil exports last year, according to PDVSA's documents and Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data, for reselling to final customers, mainly in Asia. That way it became the largest intermediary of Venezuelan oil amid U.S. sanctions.
U.S. officials have been mindful of the need for caution in targeting a company as large and far-reaching as Rosneft because of the risk of causing unintended damage to American and allies' interests. 
The Treasury Department eased sanctions on Russian aluminum giant Rusal and one unit of Chinese shipping company COSCO after they sparked mayhem in markets and supply chains. 
The United States will have conversations with China and India, the leading buyers of Venezuelan oil, and with Spanish officials over Spanish company Repsol's activities regarding Venezuela, Abrams said. Repsol (MC:REP) declined comment.
The Trump administration has implemented a broad sanctions program against Maduro's government and has urged the armed forces to turn against him. Maduro has accused the United States of preparing an invasion.

The U.S. action was announced just weeks after Guaido visited Washington and met with Trump. Maduro has called Guaido a U.S. puppet seeking to oust him in a coup.

A group of NSO employees filed a suit against Facebook in November, saying the social media group had unfairly blocked their private accounts when it sued NSO in October.
Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp accused the Israeli firm of helping government spies break into the phones of about 1,400 users in a hacking spree targeting diplomats, political dissidents, journalists and senior government officials across the world.
The NSO employees said their Facebook and Instagram accounts, and also those of former workers and family members, had been blocked.
Ruling on their complaint, Tel Aviv District Court ordered the account of one employee to be restored by Wednesday afternoon.
""We are certain that following the court's unequivocal statements, Facebook will reverse the action it took against other employees,"" the NSO spokeswoman said.

We will continue to take appropriate action to defend our users and we look forward to participating in open court to document how NSO threatens the safety and security of users and needs to be held accountable.""
The company said in November it had disabled ""relevant accounts"" after attributing a ""sophisticated cyber attack"" to the NSO Group and its employees, saying the measure was necessary for security reasons.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan declared incumbent Ashraf Ghani winner of a disputed presidential election but his main rival rejected the result and vowed to form his own government, raising the threat of new turmoil amid hopes of a U.S. peace deal with Taliban militants.
Polls were held on Sept. 28 to select a president for the fourth time since U.S.-led forces overthrew the Taliban government in 2001. But the process was marred by allegations of rigging, technical problems with biometric devices used for voting, attacks and other irregularities..
Ghani won 50.64% of the vote, the Independent Election Commission (IEC) said on Tuesday. Abdullah Abdullah, Ghani's former deputy and main rival, was named runner-up with 39.52%.
But Abdullah Abdullah said he and his allies had won the election and would form the government.
""The result they (IEC) announced today was a result of election robbery, a coup against democracy, a betrayal of the will of the people, and we consider it illegal,"" he told a press conference following the announcement.
The IEC announced preliminary results in December in which Ghani, a former World Bank official, won re-election by a slim margin, but Abdullah Abdullah dismissed the result as fraudulent and called for a full review. Ghani rejected the allegations.
The result echoes 2014, when both Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah alleged massive fraud by the other side, forcing the United States to broker an awkward power-sharing arrangement that made Ghani president and Abdullah Abdullah his chief executive.
    The relationship has since been marred by distrust and a jostling for power in Kabul.
A potential political crisis looms as the United States and the Taliban near an agreement in Doha, which officials on both sides say could be announced soon if an initial reduction in violence (RIV) is successfully observed.
Afghanistan's acting interior minister said that the RIV would be enforced within five days. 
The agreement is set to pave the way for crucial intra-Afghan talks between the political leadership and the Taliban. The militants have so far refused to talk to the government, which they have dismissed as a U.S. puppet.
The Taliban also rejected the result announced on Tuesday and termed Ghani's reelection to be against the peace process.
Two Western diplomats in Kabul told Reuters that the election result was vital.

""It was high time we got the results,"" one said on condition of anonymity. ""All Western powers were deeply invested in the democratic process.""

SHREVEPORT, La. (Reuters) - A 27-year-old woman from southern Arkansas waited nervously at the Hope Medical Group for Women after traveling two hours for a medical procedure that is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain in certain parts of the United States: an abortion.
Four weeks pregnant, the woman felt she had no option but to seek an abortion because she suffered serious medical complications during her last pregnancy, which ended in stillbirth.
""I'm incredibly thankful for this place,"" the woman told Reuters. ""I don't want to die.""
The future of the Hope clinic, located in the city of Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana, hangs in the balance. The clinic is housed in a windowless brick structure on a corner lot several miles from the casino hotel-dominated skyline of the city of about 190,000 people.
Its fate lies in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court, which on March 4 is set to hear the clinic's challenge to a tough Louisiana law placing new restrictions on doctors who perform abortions. If the law goes into effect, the clinic may have to close down.
Clinic staff members said some women would face considerable barriers to obtaining abortions if they have to travel further and some may ultimately forgo the procedure.
A 24-year-old woman who was nine weeks pregnant had traveled from east Texas. She said she sought an abortion because she was unable to take medication for a health condition while she is pregnant.
""It's important that we can make our own decisions and not be forced to have a child,"" the woman said.
Both clinic patients spoke to Reuters on condition that they not be named.
The Supreme Court's ruling, expected by the end of June, could signal whether its 5-4 conservative majority, including two justices appointed by President Donald Trump, intends to make bold moves to curtail abortion rights. Anti-abortion activists are hoping the court will undermine and eventually overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion and legalized the procedure nationwide.
Trump's administration has backed Louisiana in the case.
Abortion remains one of the most divisive social issues in the United States. Louisiana and other conservative states have in recent years passed various laws seeking to restrict abortion. The Supreme Court sets nationwide boundaries on how far states can go. A ruling in favor of Louisiana could embolden states to enact similar or even stricter laws.
When the Supreme Court in 1992 reaffirmed its Roe v. Wade ruling, it prohibited abortion laws that placed an ""undue burden"" on a woman's ability to obtain an abortion.
The court in December left in place a Kentucky restriction requiring doctors to show and describe ultrasound images to women seeking an abortion, turning away a challenge arguing that the measure violated the free speech rights of physicians.
'ADMITTING PRIVILEGES'
The Supreme Court is reviewing the legality of the 2014 Louisiana law that requires doctors who perform abortions to have an often difficult-to-obtain arrangement called ""admitting privileges"" with a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. 
U.S. District Judge John deGravelles in 2016 blocked it from taking effect, saying it created an impermissible undue burden on obtaining an abortion and would shut down two of Louisiana's three clinics - the Hope clinic and a facility in Baton Rouge. The judge, who also concluded that the admitting privileges requirement would provide no significant health benefits to women, said that only the clinic in New Orleans, more than 350 miles (560 km) southeast of Shreveport, would remain.
The Supreme Court struck down a similar admitting privileges requirement from Texas in 2016 when conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy joined the four liberal justices in the majority. But Kennedy, a supporter of abortion rights, retired in 2018. Trump, a Republican, replaced him with conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Trump's other appointee is conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch.
During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised to appoint justices who oppose abortion rights. In January, in an address to an anti-abortion rally in Washington, Trump declared, ""Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.""
Despite the 2016 Supreme Court ruling, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018 upheld the Louisiana law, prompting the clinic's lawyers to take the risky step of appealing to the Supreme Court. They won a preliminary victory in February 2019, when the Supreme Court put the appeals court ruling on hold, meaning the law has not taken effect.
The Hope clinic's administrator, Kathaleen Pittman, rejects the state's contention that additional regulation of abortion is required for health reasons.
""I think that's a total falsehood,"" Pittman said in an interview in her clinic office.
In a state with anti-abortion sentiment among its elected politicians, including Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards, Pittman considers the law part of a long-running war on abortion rights.
""We have heard them say the goal is to be an abortion-free state,"" Pittman added.
Louisiana Solicitor General Liz Murrill, who is defending the law in the case, has asked the Supreme Court to consider overturning the 2016 Texas ruling even though the precedent is just a few years old. The court is often cautious about overturning precedents and it would be unusual to take that step in a case so recently decided.
Louisiana has clear authority to regulate the clinics, Murrill said in an interview.
""Doctors do not have a constitutional right to perform abortions. They don't have a constitutional right not be regulated. If the law works the way it is supposed to work, doctors who are competent should be able to obtain privileges,"" Murrill said.
At the Supreme Court, the state has offered new information that was not considered in its defense of the law at trial. Louisiana among other things has questioned whether doctors have made ""good faith"" efforts to secure admitting privileges at local hospitals while the litigation is pending. 
The clinic's lawyers at the Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal advocacy group favoring abortion rights, reject that assertion and said the Supreme Court should analyze the case though the lens of the 2016 Texas ruling. 
Should the Supreme Court uphold Louisiana's measure, ""that would be an unfortunate opening of the floodgates,"" said Nancy Northup, the group's president. Such a ruling would ""wreak havoc on the ability of women to get access to reproductive healthcare in many states,"" Northup added.
At the Hope clinic, blocked-off windows and security restrictions on gaining entry are aimed at anti-abortion activists, reflecting the hostility some local people feel toward abortion. A sign states ""please do not feed (or speak to) the protestors.""
Shivering in the cold outside, two women, Cynthia Vaught and Angela Chagnard, sought the attention of patients going inside, hoping to counsel them not to terminate their pregnancies. Both said their opposition to abortion is based on their beliefs as Roman Catholics.
They said they hope the clinic closes.
""I would like there to be no abortion providers in the United States,"" Vaught said. ""Life is sacrosanct.""

Britta Nielsen was arrested in Johannesburg, South Africa in November 2018 with piles of cash and charged with diverting 117 million Danish crowns in state funds intended for the poor to her own accounts over a 25-year period until 2018.
Nielsen, 65, who worked for the social affairs ministry for over 40 years until her arrest, admitted at her trial that the money, which among other things was spent on horses and a mansion in South Africa, became an addiction to her.
Nielsen's lawyer, who during court proceedings blamed authorities for lax oversight of large amounts of government funds, said the sentence would not be appealed.
The verdict followed a government tax scandal and a money-laundering case involving Denmark's biggest lender, Danske Bank.
The three cases have contributed to a decline in public trust in leadership in what has long been one of the world's least corrupt countries."

TOPOLCANY, Slovakia (Reuters) - Slovakia's far right leader began the year on trial on charges of spreading hate but could end up as kingmaker in a tight parliamentary election next week, adding to nationalist challenges confronting the European Union.
Slovaks vote on Feb. 29 and Marian Kotleba's party hopes to surge to a second-place finish behind the incumbent center-left Smer, which has been weakened by corruption scandals and the politically charged murder of an investigative journalist.
With two small parties now in the ruling coalition at risk of failing to clear the 5% threshold of votes required for parliamentary seats, Smer may be forced to resort to an at least informal deal with the far right to avoid losing power.
Kotleba's People's Party Our Slovakia (LSNS) wants out of the U.S.-led NATO alliance and is deeply critical of the EU, accusing it of forcing Slovakia to put liberal, sharing-of-sovereignty values above its own national interest.
A swing toward nationalism could shift euro zone member Slovakia closer to central European neighbors Hungary and Poland, both at odds with Brussels for undermining democracy and rule of law standards, just as EU leaders seek ways to shore up the 27-nation bloc after Britain's damaging departure.
All parties including Smer have publicly ruled out any tie-up with the LSNS. But analysts say that if the election strips Smer of coalition partners, leaving a hung parliament, Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini's party could have little other choice.
""In Slovakia, politicians tend to speak of responsibility for the country's stability and determination to avoid chaos and repeated elections. That is why we cannot rule out a government of Smer, or its more radical faction at least, with LSNS and outside support by a third party,"" said political scientist Matus Sloboda. ""Let's not forget that a similar scenario - a government with the far right - transpired in Austria.""
Kotleba, 42, a former high school IT teacher, distilled his party's ""Slovakia first"" pitch at an election rally last week.
""Isn't it time for us to straighten our crouched backs and say 'enough', say that the government should first care for the needs of its citizens and not what Brussels, Washington or non-governmental organizations want?"" he told hundreds of followers in Topolcany, a town northeast of the capital Bratislava. 
""For me, and that is why I came today and I will likely vote for him, the most important thing is that (Kotleba) promised to implant order,"" said Viktor Denko, a LSNS supporter.
The LSNS took 8%, good for fifth place, in the 2016 election and recently soared to just shy of 14% in polls, about 3% behind Smer, before dipping slightly. 
RESPECT FOR WARTIME NAZI PUPPET REGIME
Kotleba's party has voiced respect in the past for Slovakia's World War Two Nazi puppet regime whose leader, Jozef Tiso, helped tens of thousands of Slovak Jews to be deported to Nazi death camps and was later tried for treason. 
But it has recently muted such views to deflect accusations of fascist inclinations. Instead, the LSNS is emphasizing pledges to toughen law and order and defend ""decent Slovaks"" against what it sees as the EU-driven evils of immigration and excesses of liberalism undermining traditional family values.
The LSNS has dropped demands for Slovakia to quit the EU but pledges to put Slovak interests ""above the dictate of Brussels"". It says it is the only party untainted by corruption, which has reduced Smer's popularity to under 17% from 25% two years ago. 
The far right has benefited markedly from mounting discontent over high-level corruption after the 2018 murder of the investigative journalist revealed a web of connections between businessmen and the political establishment.
COUNTER-DEMONSTRATION
The rally drew a counter-demonstration by dozens of liberal protesters, some carrying banners with crossed-out swastikas.
""They have no solutions, they are attacking certain groups, minorities, they make their stand against the weakest instead of offering some alternative,"" protester Branislav Vanco said.
Last year prosecutors sought to have the LSNS dissolved for what they said were fascist tendencies. But the Supreme Court dismissed the motion, saying there was insufficient evidence of a threat to dismantle Slovakia's democracy. 
Kotleba, who has referred to Slovakia's Roma minority as ""parasites"", faces a 4-8 years in prison if convicted on charges of backing calls for suppressing individual freedoms on racial and religious grounds. 
Prosecutors base their case on recent LSNS cash handouts to poor families each worth 1,488 euros ($1,606.74), a number used by extremists to represent white supremacism and a Nazi salute.

The next hearing in his trial has been postponed to March 4, just after the election. Two LSNS lawmakers have also been charged over hate speeches against Roma, Jews and Islam.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Vatican police raided the home and office of a senior Catholic Church official on Tuesday, seizing documents and computers in the latest phase of an investigation into the purchase of luxury London real estate.
The raid targeting Monsignor Alberto Perlasca followed the suspension last year of five Vatican employees, the resignation of the Vatican's police chief and the departure of the former head of the Vatican's Financial Information Authority (AIF).
Perlasca, 59, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Though he is currently a magistrate in a Vatican tribunal, the accusations against Perlasca involve his previous position as head of administration of the Secretariat of State, a Vatican statement said. He held that post until last July.
The official Vatican News website said separately that Perlasca was suspected of embezzlement, abuse of office and corruption.
The Vatican statement said the police raid resulted from questioning of the five employees suspended after a similar police raid on Oct. 1 on the offices of the AIF and of the Secretariat of State - the administrative heart of the Church.
The investigation involves suspected irregularities in the estimated $200 million purchase of a building in London's Chelsea district several years ago as an investment using Church funds.
Pope Francis and other Vatican officials have defended using Church money for real estate investments as long as they are ethical. He said last year Church money should not be ""kept in a drawer"".
Cardinal Angelo Becciu, also a former top official of the Secretariat of State, said on Monday the value of the London investment had tripled but that unspecified middlemen had behaved improperly.
""DISORIENTATION AND UNEASE""
In November, the pope acknowledged there had been suspected corruption related to the purchase but said he was glad that its discovery stemmed from whistle blowers inside the Vatican instead of information coming from outside.
The pope said this showed that new internal financial controls were working in the Vatican, a tiny city-state surrounded by Rome. Last Saturday he said the real estate affair had ""caused disorientation and unease"" among Catholic faithful.
One of the five employees suspended after the Oct. 1 raid was Tommaso di Ruzza, the AIF director, or number two. The AIF has denied all wrongdoing.
Following the first raids, the Egmont Group of world financial intelligence units suspended the Vatican from full membership because of concerns about the AIF’s ability to keep confidential documents secure.
In November, the pope did not renew the five-year mandate of Swiss lawyer and anti-money laundering expert Rene Bruelhart as head of the AIF and appointed Carmelo Barbagallo, a respected senior Bank of Italy official, to succeed.
The Vatican was fully re-admitted to the Toronto-based group last month following negotiations with Barbagallo."

A carnival float unveiled in Mainz on Tuesday depicted her next to a banner for the CDU's branch in the state of Thuringia and a 'stop' sign.
Kramp-Karrenbauer's inability to prevent the CDU in Thuringia joining the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) in a vote for a state premier this month shattered the post-war consensus among established parties of shunning the far right.
She duly gave up her ambition of running to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel, her mentor, as chancellor.
Germany's six-day long pre-Lent carnival festivities are a chance for politicians to lampoon each other, dress up and drink a lot of beer - and the floats afford party-goers the opportunity to make fun of their leaders.
This year's float in Mainz carrying a papier-mâché figure of Kramp-Karrenbauer showed her in a pose adopted by Merkel and in a coat she could not fill, making fun of her inability to size up to her mentor's role.
Other floats this year mocked Merkel's climate goals, and showed U.S. President Donald Trump, Russia's Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping of China, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un dressed up as clowns.
Revelers parade floats through the streets of Rhineland cities including Cologne and Mainz on Shrove Monday - or 'Rosenmontag' - which falls on Feb. 24 this year."

BEIRUT/GENEVA (Reuters) - Government air strikes have hit hospitals and refugee camps in northwest Syria and killed about 300 civilians as President Bashar al-Assad's forces press an assault against the last rebel stronghold, the United Nations said on Tuesday.
U.N. officials said relief agencies were overwhelmed by the humanitarian crisis as nearly one million civilians, most of them women and children, had fled toward the Turkish border in bitter winter conditions to escape the onslaught.
""Civilians fleeing the fighting are being squeezed into areas without safe shelter that are shrinking in size by the hour. And still they are bombed. They simply have nowhere to go,"" U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said in a statement.
Syrian and Russian warplanes meanwhile kept up raids on the town of Darat Izza in Aleppo province on Tuesday, witnesses said, one day after two hospitals there were badly damaged.
At Al Kinana Hospital, blown-out walls and dust-covered medical cables and supplies were strewn about the hospital after two staff were wounded on Monday, witnesses said.
At talks in Moscow on Tuesday, Turkey told Russia its troops were ready to push the Moscow-backed Syrian forces from rebel-held areas if they did not pull back to behind a line of Turkish observation posts in Idlib province.
""(The Turkish delegation) conveyed clearly that Turkey made the necessary military preparation to make sure the Syrian government withdraws to previous borders if they do not do retreat themselves,"" Omer Celik, a spokesman for Turkey's ruling AK Party, told reporters in Ankara.
Turkey says it cannot cope with a new refugee influx which would swell the numbers of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees already stranded inside its borders.
Appearing on national television on Monday, Assad said the rapid military gains presaged the eventual defeat of the nine-year-old insurgency against him although it could still take time. The rebel factions include Turkish-backed rebels and jihadist militants.
POSSIBLE WAR CRIMES
U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville, asked if Syria and Russia were deliberately targeting civilians and protected buildings, said: ""The sheer quantity of attacks on hospitals, medical facilities, and schools would suggest they cannot all be accidental.""
The attacks could constitute war crimes, Colville told a briefing in Geneva.
The U.N. human rights office said it had recorded 299 civilian deaths since Jan. 1, about 93% caused by the Syrian government and its allies.
The swift advance of government troops, backed by Russian air strikes, through northwest Syria has caused the biggest displacement of the war as people flee towards a shrinking pocket near the Turkish frontier where insurgents hold their last strongholds.
A U.N. spokesman, David Swanson, said close to 900,000 people have fled conflict zones in Idlib province and western Aleppo since December, more than 80% of them women and children.
Many have been unable to find shelter and are sleeping outside in freezing temperatures, burning plastic to stay warm and at risk of disease and death.
""Only half of all the health facilities in northwest are still functioning now,"" Swanson said.
Hurras Network, a Save the Children partner in Idlib, said seven children including a seven-month-old baby had died from freezing temperatures and bleak conditions in displaced persons camps.
About 525,000 children are among those trapped, the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) said.
FULL CONTROL
The Syrian army said on Monday it had taken full control of dozens of towns in the Aleppo countryside.
The M5 highway linking Damascus to Aleppo, the focus of recent fighting, was re-opened to civilian traffic on Tuesday after government forces recaptured it last week, the Syrian Observatory war monitor reported.
The opposition said air strikes in southern areas of Idlib province had left dozens of towns and villages in ruins in what it called a ""scorched earth policy"". 
The Russian and Turkish delegations meeting in Moscow were trying to reconcile their differences over Idlib, which have raised questions over the durability of their cooperation.
Turkey has sent thousands of troops and convoys of military equipment to reinforce its observation posts in Idlib, established under a 2018 de-escalation agreement with Russia.
Moscow has accused Turkey of flouting their agreements and failing to rein in militants it said were attacking Syrian and Russian forces. 
In one positive note, Turkish and Russian troops have restarted joint patrols near the border that had been halted since October, at Russian defense ministry official said.
Trucks carrying aid supplies still cross from Turkey into northern Syria in a U.N. relief operation, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Tuesday.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Under beating midday sun and samba drums, a glitter-sprinkled crew gather in Sao Paulo's historic center, ready for carnival. 
While the rest of the shimmering, semi-naked crowd load up on vodka mixers at Casa Comigo, a street party the Saturday before Brazil's carnival holiday, this group is on a different mission - to make sure the sensual chaos stays consensual.
""You're the angels for today,"" a woman in a multi-colored headdress and fluorescent earrings tells the eclectic group of 11 as they're handed stacks of temporary tattoos and stickers with the message ""no means no.""
A group of volunteers linked to Sao Paulo's City Hall, the 'angels' circulate at street parties raising awareness of sexual harassment. They are also on the lookout for the drunk and vulnerable or incidents of sexual assault. 
In Brazil it is a said that during carnival ""vale tudo"" or ""anything goes,"" promiscuity is celebrated and no costume is too much, or indeed too little. 
But there is a darker side getting increasing attention. Reported cases of sexual violence jump by around a fifth in the months of carnival, according to the federal government. 
Many incidents go unreported. Catraca Livre, a community news site helping to run the angel program, says many in Brazil still explain away sexual harassment as flirtatious banter.
Luna Souza a 20-year-old black trans woman with a headband of gold tinsel, weaves between drinks stands sticking ""no means no"" to coolers and parasols. 
A group of teenage girls rushes over shouting, ""I want one! I want one!"" They proudly put the round red stickers on their chests like stop lights. 
Souza decided to volunteer in part due to her experience of being groped in clubs. ""I'm here for the cause,"" she says.
""We live with harassment every day, but during carnival it's worse,"" said Heloisa Aun, a 26-year-old journalist with a purple sparkling Venus symbol dangling from her left ear. 
Aun began campaigning at carnival five years ago. Back then she was largely alone, now there are 50 fellow angels in Sao Paulo and 100,000 stickers to distribute.
""I do think things are changing,"" she said, despite having suffered harassment while volunteering. 

As the angels sprinkle stickers through the crowd, Souza hands one to a muscular man with a pectoral tattoo of a giant scorpion. He holds it suspiciously, pauses, shrugs and sticks it over the center of his giant chest.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A hard-hitting YouTube documentary about Russia's HIV epidemic by a popular blogger has attracted more than 13 million views in a week and even drawn praise from the Kremlin.
Some pharmacists have also reported a rush to snap up express HIV tests after the film, which is just under two hours long, was released on Feb. 11.
There are over a million people in Russia infected with HIV and the epidemic has been growing among the general population, according to health officials.
But critics have condemned the authorities for adopting what they say are overly conservative social policies that hamper HIV prevention and for not providing the country's HIV patients with proper care.
Methadone, which research has shown helps prevent injecting drug users passing on HIV, is banned in Russia for example.
Viewed 13.4 million times, the new documentary, by blogger Yuri Dud, details the personal histories of people with HIV, the discrimination they face and informs viewers how not to contract the virus.
Dud, known for his documentaries about controversial issues in Russian society, takes a rapid HIV test on camera himself using an oral swab, an act which anecdotal evidence shows appears to have been copied by many viewers.
Demand for rapid HIV tests has significantly increased since the film's release, Anton Buzdalin, who heads a popular online pharmacy, told the Vedomosti daily. He said the tests had sold out in within a few hours of the documentary being released.
""With one video, Dud gave the country and its people more information that many lawmakers and politicians,"" YouTube user Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM) Ananyev wrote in the comments under the documentary.
The film has also drawn official reaction, including a pledge by the head of the country's Audit Chamber to review the effectiveness of medical care given to HIV patients.
Alexei Kudrin, a former finance minister who heads the Audit Chamber, wrote on Twitter that Dud had made a much-needed film and that HIV represented a much greater threat to Russia than the coronavirus epidemic in neighbouring China.
The Kremlin has also tuned in.
""I watched it, it was good,"" President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said this week. ""The main thing is that the relevant (official) bodies are acquainted with it."""
811,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 09:57AM ET</span>",Palestinians channel protests through dawn prayers,"By Stephen Farrell and Ali Sawafta
NABLUS (Reuters) - Before sunrise, thousands of Palestinians streamed toward the mosque in Nablus's Victory Square (NYSE:SQ), swelling the usual crowds of morning worshippers to launch a new front in their protests against Israel and the United States.
The scene has been repeated elsewhere in the West Bank, where people have begun turning out for early prayers in unprecedented numbers, forsaking the usual protest sites where they risk arrest and channeling their anger into a mass expressions of faith.
""This is the most peaceful way to get the message out,” said restaurant owner Saif Abu Baker, as the Nablus crowds spilled out of the mosque into surrounding alleyways and courtyards.
Political slogans including ""For the sake of God, we have risen up"" echoed through Nablus's Old City after the calls from the muezzin and the murmured recitations of the faithful.
“I would hope that it is a new form of channeling the way the message is being sent out there,"" said Abu Baker. ""Because we have tried protesting and it did not work because we don’t have enough power. It’s the safer way for everyone.”
Much of the crowd's message at Friday's fajr (dawn) prayers - the day when most people turn out - was a rejection of the perceived pro-Israel bias of U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan.
There have only been small regular street rallies since that plan was launched last week. Few have responded to calls by President Mahmoud Abbas's Palestinian Authority for ‘Days of Rage’.
Instead many have begun heeding calls on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other social media sites to attend what is becoming known as the ‘Great Fajr Campaign’ - described as a show of solidarity against Trump and what they see as Israeli threats to Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem and Hebron. Those two cities have also seen larger turnouts in the past few weeks.
The first calls for a surge in attendance were from Fatah, Abbas's nationalist political faction that dominates the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Numbers grew after the campaign gained support from the Islamist group Hamas, which holds sway in mosques, especially in cities where it has a sizeable following. 
KNIGHTS OF THE DAWN
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum, in Gaza, told Reuters the campaign was a bid to alert Palestinians to the Trump plan, and to Israel's plans to annex its West Bank settlements.
In Nablus - where crowds surged to several thousand on Friday, from around 2,000 the week before - worshippers insisted there was no single group behind the drive, describing it as a grassroots movement still finding its feet.
But the streets echoed with chants popular at Hamas rallies, including: ""A nation with the leadership of Muhammad will not be defeated"".
The event appeared to be organized - extra prayer carpets were rolled out, food and water were available in abundance and the gathering was supervised by stewards wearing fluorescent jackets proclaiming them ‘Knights of the Dawn,’ and bearing the stenciled image of the nearby al-Nasr (Victory) mosque.
The crowds have been much smaller than the numbers that attended the Great March of Return protests at the Gaza border fence when that campaign started nearly two years ago.
In those Gaza demonstrations, 215 Palestinians were killed and several thousand injured in confrontations with Israeli troops. One Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian sniper.
In Nablus the crowds at dawn prayers have been peaceful, with little sign of any heightened security.
Hani Al-Masri, a Palestinian political analyst, said the campaign reflected Hamas's cautious approach to operating in the West Bank, where, unlike Gaza, it faces Israeli troops and Palestinian Authority forces intent on stopping Hamas from inflaming the streets and seizing control.
""Hamas's organization in the West Bank is not in good shape because of crackdowns by the Palestinian Authority and by Israel,"" he said.
“Fajr prayers is the most that Hamas can do.""

Asked whether Israel was aware of the enlarged dawn prayer meetings, an Israeli military spokesman and the Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency had no immediate comment.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China reported on Tuesday its fewest new coronavirus infections since January and its lowest daily death toll for a week, but the World Health Organization said data suggesting the epidemic had slowed should still be viewed with caution.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) warned that its sales would suffer as the epidemic hurt both its supply in China and its demand, an announcement that knocked the wind out of global stock markets.
For more Reuters coverage of the Coronavirus, click: https://www.reuters.com/live-events/coronavirus-6-id2921484
The head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, died of the disease on Tuesday, becoming one of the most prominent victims since the disease first appeared at the end of last year.
Chinese officials reported 1,886 new cases - the first time the daily figure has fallen below 2,000 since Jan. 30 - bringing the mainland China total to 72,436. A figure of 98 new deaths marked the first time the daily toll in China had fallen below 100 since Feb. 11, bringing the total to 1,868.
World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Chinese data ""appears to show a decline in new cases"" but any apparent trend ""must be interpreted very cautiously"".
Outside China, there have been 827 cases of the disease, known as COVID-19, and five deaths, according to a Reuters count based on official statements. More than half of those cases have been on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan.
China says figures showing a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.
But Tom Wingfield, a senior lecturer and physician at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: ""It is too early to be certain whether this represents a sustained reduction in COVID-19 transmission and that the epidemic has peaked."" 
The numbers appeared encouraging, said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Britain's University of Edinburgh, who described himself as cautious.
""Though it is unrealistic to reduce the transmission rate to zero it may have been reduced to a level where the epidemic is brought under control,"" Woolhouse said.
""It may be that epidemic is simply running its natural course, and is starting to run out of new people to infect. It could also be that the unprecedented public health measures introduced in China are having the desired effect.""
Chinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to fall victim. The hospital was designated solely for treating virus-infected patients.
GLOBAL REPERCUSSIONS
While China says its lockdown of cities and tough curbs on travel and movement have limited the spread of the virus, this has come at great cost to its economy, with repercussions for global businesses.
Stock markets had nonetheless roared ahead, boasted by expectations of stimulus measures to keep China's economy humming. But Apple's warning it would fall short of guidance for quarterly revenue because of slower iPhone production and weak Chinese demand sent markets lower.
""We have been pointing out that the market reaction in past weeks was excessively constructive and this could be a wake-up call to all investors that ignored so far potential negative impact,"" analysts at UniCredit said.
Chinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020 despite the epidemic.
Economists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon.
""The employment situation is OK in the first quarter, but if the virus is not contained by end-March, then from the second quarter, we'll see a big round of layoffs,"" said Dan Wang, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Job losses could run as high as 4.5 million, he forecast.
Firms in China's services sector and small manufacturers are bearing the brunt of the impact so far. When cameraman Mark Xia returned to his job this month after holidays, the Shanghai video production house where he worked told him to take three months' leave with no pay. He is looking for a new job.
""I understand the company's cash-flow is tight,"" Xia, 25, told Reuters. ""We postponed some shooting due to the coronavirus outbreak, and that's had a huge impact on our revenues. That's the reality.""
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the economy was in an emergency situation and required stimulus as the epidemic had disrupted demand for South Korean goods.
Singapore announced a $4.5 billion financial package to help contain the outbreak in the city-state and weather its economic impact.
Singapore Airlines Ltd said it would temporarily cut flights in the three months to May, as the epidemic hits demand for services touching and transiting the key travel hub.

Japan, where the economy was already shrinking and the epidemic has created fears of recession, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to put limits on public crowds while some companies are telling employees to work from home.

SILIVRI, Turkey (Reuters) - A Turkish court on Tuesday acquitted businessman Osman Kavala and eight others over their alleged role in the Gezi Park protests of 2013, delivering a surprise verdict in a case that had drawn criticism from Western allies and rights groups.
Applause erupted in the courtroom and some people cried in disbelief when the decision was announced. A guilty verdict had been widely expected in the case, regarded as a test of justice in Turkey.
Philanthropist Kavala was ordered to be set free after more than two years in jail. The European Court of Human Rights in December demanded his immediate release, saying there was a lack of reasonable suspicion that he had committed a crime.
""Of course today's decision is the right one (but) this has been a sham process. We've seen Turkey's justice system turned into an absurd, cruel theater,"" Human Rights Watch Turkey director Emma Sinclair-Webb told Reuters.
In 2013, hundreds of thousands marched in Istanbul and elsewhere in Turkey against plans to build a replica Ottoman barracks on Istanbul's Gezi Park in a major challenge against then-Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan.
Eight young protesters and a police officer were killed, and 5,000 were injured, in the unrest.
Kavala and two other defendants had been facing life sentences without parole, while the other defendants were accused of aiding them in attempting to overthrow the government by organizing the protests. They had denied the allegations.
At one point in the hearing, police scuffled in the courtroom with defense lawyers who attempted to prevent them forcibly removing a lawyer who had repeatedly requested permission to speak.
'CONSPIRATORIAL FICTION'
The case of seven further defendants, who are abroad and were being tried in absentia, was separated but arrest warrants for them were lifted. One lawyer said they were also expected to be acquitted.
Critics of Erdogan's government have questioned the independence of Turkish courts, especially since a crackdown following a failed coup in 2016. Erdogan, now Turkey's president, and his ruling AK Party say the judiciary makes independent decisions.
After final statements from defendants, the judge read the verdict in which he said they did not commit the alleged crimes.
Mucella Yapici, one of the defendants, said in an interview: ""I hope this is the beginning, the first step of returning to law. That is what Gezi is, it is a step toward the light.""
In his defense, Kavala had stressed the European Court of Human Rights decision demanding his immediate release and had described as a ""conspiratorial fiction"" the idea that the protests were an attempt to overthrow the government.
A court previously acquitted people prosecuted over the 2013 protests, with a judge ruling in 2015 they were exercising the right of freedom of assembly.
But in 2017 Kavala was arrested and the following year police arrested the other 15 defendants including civil society figures, writers and actors.
The prosecutions were part of a crackdown that Turkey says is necessary on security grounds. It has involved widespread purges of the armed forces, ministries and state organizations."

Netanyahu, the first sitting Israeli prime minister to be charged with a crime, has denied any wrongdoing in the three corruption cases against him.
In addition to his legal battle, Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, is fighting for his political life in a March 2 election, after inconclusive ballots in April and September.
In a statement, the ministry said Netanyahu, in power for the past decade and Israel's longest-serving leader, will be required to attend the Jerusalem District Court for the first session to hear an indictment against him. A three-judge panel will hear the case.
Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in three corruption cases. Charges, which were formally filed with the court three weeks ago, include bribery, breach of trust and fraud.

Netanyahu, 70, is accused of wrongfully accepting $264,000 worth of gifts, which prosecutors said included cigars and champagne, from tycoons, and of dispensing regulatory favours in alleged bids for improved coverage by a popular news website. He could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust.

KIEV (Reuters) - Daria Mastikasheva was one of scores of prisoners exchanged between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in December, but she says she is now being kept against her will in a hospital in eastern Ukraine by the same people who secured her release.
A former taekwondo champion, Mastikasheva spent years in Ukrainian custody on what she says were trumped up treason charges in a case that was documented by rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.
She was handed over to separatist fighters in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine in a mass prisoner exchange, one of a number of confidence-building measures agreed by Ukraine and Russia to end the simmering conflict.
Instead of being allowed to return home to her family, she says she is being kept in a hospital for reasons that the separatist authorities refuse to explain. Initially the hospital told her she might be at risk of contracting hepatitis C.
She can eat and sleep for free at the hospital and leave the building, provided she returns by eight o'clock every night. When she tried to cross the border into Russia last week, the border guards refused, saying she was under a travel ban.
""The fact of the matter is that here no one is explaining anything to anyone,"" she told Reuters by phone.
""It is impossible to talk to someone, to contact them for some clarification. Three weeks ago we were told - 'you still need to stay here for a week'. But three weeks passed and nothing has happened.""
She said 13 other freed prisoners were housed at the same hospital, one of them a Russian citizen and the rest Ukrainian.
The separatist authorities declined a request for comment. The hospital did not respond to a request for comment.
The conflict between Ukrainian troops and Moscow-backed fighters has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014. Tuesday saw some of the worst fighting since a Paris summit in December.
Mastikasheva is a Ukrainian citizen who was living with her partner in Moscow. She was captured by the Ukrainian security services in 2017 while visiting her mother and son in Ukraine.
She confessed on camera to being an agent of Russia's Federal Security Service, plotting to recruit Ukrainian war veterans to carry out attacks in Russia that the FSB could then blame on Ukraine.
Mastikasheva said the confession was extracted from her under torture."

ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia's new president Zoran Milanovic urged more solidarity in society as he formally took office on Tuesday, and called for vigilance against populist approaches to issues such as climate change that may distort or ignore scientific facts.
Unlike his four predecessors who were sworn in at Zagreb's mediaeval St. Mark square that houses the government and the parliament buildings, Milanovic, 53, chose to organize a smaller ceremony at his office on a hill in a largely residential area overlooking central Zagreb.
""The majority of voters can vote for a decision that there are no climate changes or that it is not a problem,"" Milanovic told a gathering of top state officials. ""It won't change the truth that the problem exists.""
He said the truth was one thing and another thing was ""a legitimate political will to do something with that truth, or do nothing"".
""Independent media, the judiciary and the scientific community are the strongest defense against any form of tyranny,"" Milanovic, who was prime minister from 2011 to 2015, said.
Milanovic, candidate of the opposition Social Democrats, won the five-year presidential term in early January against the outgoing president, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, candidate of the ruling conservative HDZ party.
""I will not be a corrective, but a constructive (political) factor,"" Milanovic said.
The role of the president in Croatia is largely ceremonial. He has no power to veto laws, but has a say in security, defense and foreign policy matters.
""Strengthening solidarity and social inclusiveness, more just distribution of wealth, and a fight against clientelism are the main and the most effective tools against inequality and alienation in society,"" Milanovic said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Jailed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is no longer being kept in solitary confinement and his health is improving, his spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told reporters on Tuesday.
Assange, 48, is in Belmarsh high-security prison in London, fighting an extradition request from the United States where he faces 18 counts including conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law. He could spend decades in prison if convicted.
His supporters had expressed concern about the state of his health after he appeared confused during a court hearing in October, struggling to recall his age and name and saying he was unable to think properly.
Assange was moved from solitary confinement in the medical wing to a different part of the prison with 40 other inmates after his legal team and prisoners complained that his treatment was unfair, Hrafnsson said.
""I saw him about 10 days ago - he has improved thanks to the pressure from his legal team, the general public, and amazingly, actually from other inmates in Belmarsh Prison to get him out of isolation,"" Hrafnsson said ahead of an extradition hearing that starts next week.
Australian-born Assange made global headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache (NYSE:APA) helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff.
WikiLeaks later angered the United States by publishing caches of leaked military documents and diplomatic cables.
Assange has consistently presented himself as a champion of free speech being persecuted for exposing abuses of power. But his critics paint him as a dangerous figure complicit in Russian efforts to undermine the West.
He fled to the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was wanted for questioning about allegations of sex crimes which have since been dropped. He spent seven years holed up in the embassy until Ecuador decided to stop giving him refuge and he was dragged out last May.
Earlier, a group of doctors representing 117 physicians and psychologists from 18 nations called in a letter for an end to what they described as ""the psychological torture and medical neglect of Julian Assange"".
His father, John Shipton, said Assange's long confinement indoors had damaged his health and feared that sending his son to the US would be akin to a ""death sentence"".
""His situation is dire, he has had nine years of ceaseless psychological torture where false accusations are constantly being made,"" he told reporters.

The explosion, which is being investigated by authorities, happened late on Monday in a rural region of Colombia's Cauca province, some 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of capital city Bogota.
""This is no random attack. This was a military vehicle moving from Pasto toward Cali. It was moving when it exploded,"" General Jorge Isaacs Hoyos, commander of the Colombian army's third division, told journalists.
Those who died were thrown from the vehicle when it exploded, the general said. The explosion hit two other vehicles and forced them from the road, injuring those inside, Hoyos said.
The region where the explosion happened is contested by guerillas of the National Liberation Army (ELN), dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) - who returned to arms citing a breakdown of the 2016 peace deal - and criminal groups connected to drug trafficking, according to security sources.
The cultivation of coca leaves and the production of cocaine fuels conflict in the Andean country, which after more than 50 years has left 260,000 dead and millions displaced, according to the government.
The explosion happened following an escalation in attacks by the ELN in different regions of the country, where the rebels have set fire to vehicles, blocked roads, threatened citizens and attacked army patrols."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A man killed his ex-wife and wounded another person at a shopping center in Bangkok on Tuesday, police said, just 10 days after a mass shooting at another mall in Thailand's northeast.
The gunman fled the Century The Movie Plaza mall, near the Victory Monument in the capital and is still on the run, police said.
He had gone into a beauty clinic at the mall where his ex-wife worked and opened fire, killing her and wounding a bystander, Colonel Kissana Pattanacharoen said.
The shooting came as Thailand is on edge after the shooting rampage earlier in the month.
On Feb. 8 and 9, a soldier killed at least a dozen people at the Terminal 21 shopping center in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima. He had earlier killed his commanding officer, other soldiers at his base and several people at a Buddhist temple.
Gun ownership is relatively common in Thailand, with about 10 million privately owned firearms in the country in 2016, according to Gunpolicy.org, or one for about every seven citizens.
Gun violence killed 1,729 people in 2016, about 10 times the rate per 100,000 as in neighboring Malaysia, the organization said.
Most violence involving firearms stem from personal disputes or robberies. Mass shootings or killings in public spaces are rare other than in the far south, where a decades-old insurgency persists.

Turkey and Russia have jointly patrolled Syrian territory near the Turkish border since October. But Turkish forces had not shown up since Feb. 3, the Interfax news agency cited a Russian defense ministry official as saying.
A Turkish security source said on Feb. 7 that Ankara's joint patrols with Moscow had been postponed because of weather conditions. Their suspension coincided with rising tensions between the two countries over Idlib.
Moscow last week accused Turkey of flouting agreements it had made with Russia on Syria's nine-year-old war and of failing to rein in militants in Idlib it said were mounting attacks on Syrian and Russian forces.
Russia-backed Syrian government forces have mounted an offensive on Syria's last militant stronghold in Idlib near the Turkish border, forcing thousands of civilians to flee.
""The latest joint Russian-Turkish patrol took place..."", Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement without elaborating.
A Turkish delegation was in Moscow on Tuesday for a second day of talks as the two countries tried to reconcile their differences over Idlib."

French President Emmanuel Macon, who blocked the opening of talks with Skopje and Tirana in October, said at the weekend he was willing to allow them to begin membership talks if the European Commission gave them a positive review next month.
""I am very encouraged by my visits to both countries,"" Enlargement Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi told a think-tank event. ""They do not give up on reforms ... and you will see that they will deliver, and if they do that, you can be confident that there should be an opening of negotiations.""
If allowed to go ahead with membership talks, the approval would set the stage for a summit with EU leaders and all six western Balkan candidate countries - Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia and North Macedonia - in Zagreb in May.
It may go some way to assuaging concerns in the EU about growing Chinese and Russian influence in the six states and a sense that the bloc is failing to transform the countries scarred by the wars of the 1990s into market economies.
Macron's comments on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference were also likely to reassure other European leaders that France still backs expanding the EU to new members.
""There is nothing but membership on offer,"" Varhelyi said.
Macron had refused to approve the start of so-called accession negotiations at a summit in October, saying the process of admitting new members needed to change. One French minister called the accession process an ""endless soap opera"".
This month, the Commission suggested reforms to the accession process along the lines of a French proposal made in November, giving EU governments more say and making it easier to stop or reset negotiations and freeze funds.
Denmark and the Netherlands, who supported Macron, are expected to drop their resistance, EU diplomats told Reuters.
France and its allies are concerned about the EU's ability to bring in a region struggling with crime and corruption, anxious not to repeat what they believe was the rushed accession of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007.
Membership talks, once underway, will take years."

The Philippines announced its decision before Hong Kong reported that a Filipina domestic helper became its 61st case of coronavirus in the country.
There are more than 180,000 Filipinos in Hong Kong, many working as helpers, according to the Philippines Labour Ministry.
The Philippines had imposed a travel ban on China and its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau. It later included Taiwan in the ban, but lifted it a few days after.
There was no immediate comment from Philippine officials on how the latest development in Hong Kong will affect its decision to relax its travel restriction.
The Philippines also said it would allow foreign spouses or children of Filipinos and holders of diplomatic visas travelling from China, Macau and Hong Kong to enter the country but they will be subjected to a 14-day quarantine.
Initially, only Filipinos and holders of permanent resident visas travelling from these areas were allowed entry.
Recruiters have appealed to the government to exempt Filipino workers from the travel ban because many of them are breadwinners. They could also lose their visas if they failed to report for work on time, the Society of Hong Kong Accredited Recruiters of the Philippines has said.
In 2019, Filipino workers in Hong Kong sent home $801 million in foreign exchange remittances, central bank data showed.
Filipinos leaving for Hong Kong and Macau for study and employment will be required to sign a declaration that they know the risks of going there, health officials said.
The Philippine government also said it will repatriate Filipino crew and passengers from the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess who wish to come home.
The cruise ship, owned by Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp and carrying some 3,700 passengers and crew, has been quarantined in Yokohama since Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong before it traveled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus.
The Philippine Foreign Ministry said 35 of the 538 Filipinos onboard had tested positive for the coronavirus, including the eight new cases, who are all crew members.

Since then, after a run of good fortune, the Indian real estate broker has transformed his modest home into a shrine to the U.S. leader, who is due in India on Monday for a two-day visit.
""My love for him has transformed into reverence. That has given me immense happiness. Hence instead of praying to other gods, I started praying to him,"" Krishna told Reuters.
Krishna, who lives alone in a village in the southern state of Telangana, has erected a life-size statue to Trump in his yard, while his walls are scrawled with the leader's name - to the annoyance of his extended family.
""I am facing difficulties because of my relatives,"" Krishna said. ""They tell me that I am disgracing them in society. I told them that just like you believe and worship Shiva, I believe and worship Trump. Neither of us can stop the other from doing so.""
Krishna is not the only Indian who reveres Trump.
In New Delhi, members of the Hindu Sena, a right-wing fringe group, have begun rehearsing a welcome song in his honor.
Its members say Trump shares their hatred of Islamic extremism, and it has drawn attention for boisterous celebrations of his birthday, including pretending to feed cake to photos of his face.

Malaysia has barred the return of 13 managerial staff on the $11-billion East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) after they returned to China's central province of Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, during their Lunar New Year holidays.
Bai Yinzhan, managing director of contractor CCC-ECRL, the Malaysian unit of China Communications Construction, said the affected staff would work out of their homes in Wuhan, the provincial capital, during Malaysia's temporary ban.
""They can work from home,"" Bai told a news briefing. ""There has not been a major impact on the work. We can use network video platforms to continue communicating.""
Nearly 200 Chinese staff, who also went back for the annual holiday, are now back at work following 14 days of self quarantine at base camps in Malaysia, said Darwis Abdul Razak, chief executive of project owner Malaysia Rail Link.
Darwis said officials do not expect the outbreak to delay construction of the 640-km (398-mile) rail project, nor do they see delays in loan drawdowns from China Export-Import Bank (China Exim), which is lending 85% of the total project cost.
""As far as fund disbursement is concerned, everything is progressing well,"" Darwis said. ""We did not get any indication from (China Exim) that they are going to stop everything.""
China and Malaysia resumed construction of the train project in July, after a year-long suspension and a deal to pare down its cost by about a third from nearly $17 billion initially.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Stuck in traffic in a fume-filled taxi with a cracked windscreen, Peter Likiel says his four-mile daily commute has doubled to three hours since construction began on one of Congo President Felix Tshisekedi's signature new overpasses.
The president had envisioned a series of sleek roadways above the capital Kinshasa's congested boulevards that would strike a bold first impression after he took over from his long-serving predecessor, Joseph Kabila.
Instead, more than a year after his inauguration, the so-called ""sauts-de-mouton"" – French for ""sheep-jumps"" – are mostly half-built due to delays mobilizing funds, snarling traffic and ensnaring the government in accusations of graft.
""I thought it was a good thing, when it was announced,"" said Likiel, 64, as his taxi nosed toward the construction site of the new Socimat junction overpass in downtown Kinshasa, a mess of girders and poured concrete where only one side of the bridge has been started.
The English teacher's thoughts changed when his commute costs doubled to about a third of his salary.
""Now there are some places where it has become impossible to pass.""
The situation has become a full-blown crisis for Tshisekedi, who was already struggling to prove he had the political strength to modernize the country and stamp out corruption, despite being forced into a coalition government dominated by allies of Kabila, who was in power from 2001-2019.
The endless traffic jams and buck-passing between senior members of government have dominated the front pages of newspapers in the capital city of some 12 million people.
The public prosecutor announced this month that he had opened an investigation into the delays, requesting procurement documents from several ministries and the central bank.
Tshisekedi promised in July that the sheep-jumps would be a ""Christmas present"" to Kinshasa residents. Since then, different officials have offered wildly conflicting status reports.
The head of Tshisekedi's party Jean-Marc Kabund said this month that only 30% of the work is complete while Tshisekedi's chief of staff Vital Kamerhe has said over two-thirds is done.
Watchdog groups complain that none of the projects in the $304-million program for Tshisekedi's first 100 days, which included roads, bridges and social housing, were approved by parliament in the 2019 budget.
Florimond Muteba from the Observatory of Public Expenditure, a Congolese transparency group, said wasteful spending has worsened under Tshisekedi, a charge the president denies.
Tshisekedi visited various sheep-jumps on Friday. At the Socimat overpass, he shook his head as workers briefed him on the project.
""The saut-de-mouton here, I was never in agreement with it,"" he said.

The proposal, made by a parliamentary working group, comes after President Vladimir Putin last month announced sweeping reforms to the political system that would shift some powers away from the presidency.
Putin's initiatives, which were followed by a government shake-up, are widely seen as a way to allow him to extend his grip on power after his term ends in 2024.
The proposals by the parliamentary working group assessing Putin's reforms include making former presidents immune from criminal prosecution, said Pavel Krashennikov, the group's co-chair.
""The president of Russia, having ceased to exercise his powers, has immunity. We have this (proposed reform),"" he said at a working group meeting, RIA news agency reported.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters he would not comment on the working group's proposal at this stage.
Krashennikov had said earlier this month that Russian presidents could be made senators for life after their term. Lawmakers in the lower and upper houses of parliament are immune to criminal prosecution under Russian law.
The working group has already put forward an array of other proposals, including one that would change Putin's job description to Supreme Ruler from head of state.
Russia's lower house of parliament has already backed Putin's proposed reforms in a vote last month.
For the group's proposals to be adopted, they must be approved by the lower house of parliament in two further votes before being voted on by the upper house, reviewed by regional parliaments and then signed by Putin.
Putin has said that the proposed changes would be put to a nationwide vote, but a date has yet to be set."

AHMEDABAD, India (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will inaugurate the world's largest cricket stadium when he arrives in Ahmedabad, the home base of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Monday at the start of a two-day visit aimed at smoothing ties strained by trade disputes.
Making his first official trip to the world's largest democracy, Trump is also expected to visit the humble abode of India's independence hero Mahatma Gandhi in Ahmedabad.
The leaders of China, Japan and Israel have all visited Ahmedabad since Modi became prime minister. It is the biggest city in Gujarat, the western state where Modi made his mark as chief minister before his Hindu nationalist party swept to power in 2014. 
If his Indian hosts can help it, Trump probably won't see a slum as they've ordered for a 400-metre wall to be built along his route to block the view of where poor people live. 
Authorities in Ahmedabad expect to spend around 800 million to 850 million Indian rupees ($11-12 million) on preparations for the visit by the American president that is likely to last around three hours, two government officials with direct knowledge of the plans told Reuters. 
The sum is equivalent to equivalent to about 1.5% of the annual budget for the home ministry in Gujarat.
Security-related costs, with more than 12,000 police officers expected to be deployed, will account for almost half the expense, said the officials, who declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak publicly about the visit.
Ahmedabad municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra, the city's top civic official, told Reuters that authorities had already spent around 300 million rupees ($4.2 million) on widening roads and improving infrastructure around the new cricket stadium.
With capacity for 110,000 spectators, the Motera Stadium will dislodge the Melbourne Cricket Ground as the world's largest cricket stadium.
""Eighteen roads of about 20 kilometers (12 miles) in length from Ahmedabad Airport to Motera Stadium have been widened or re-laid,"" Nehra said, adding that the improvements had been planned before Trump's visit was confirmed.
A further 60 million Indian rupees ($840,000) will go on ""beautification"" of the city, said Nehra, including erecting the wall to spare Trump's view. 
Ashok Brahmbhatt, secretary of Gujarat Cricket Association, which owns the Motera Stadium set to be opened by Trump, said it would also spend tens of millions of rupees during the event. 
Nehra tweeted on Sunday that more than 100,000 participants had registered so far to greet Trump as he heads from the airport to the city center. Trump said last week Modi had promised ""millions and millions"" of people would line his route.

Trump may also visit the famous Taj Mahal monument in the city of Agra, and all leave for police officers in that city has been canceled, according to a document seen by Reuters.

Luxury companies already face a sales hit from the coronavirus outbreak as they shutter shops in China and shelve advertising campaigns in the world's second-largest economy.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A group of North Korean refugees launched a political party in South Korea on Tuesday, aiming to give a voice to the 33,500 defectors living in the South and oppose conciliation with Pyongyang.
""We were always considered minorities and aliens,"" said Kim Joo-il, secretary-general of the new South-North Unification Party at its launch at a hall in South Korea's capital Seoul. ""North Korean defectors are now the future of unification.""
The decision to set up a formal political party was a sign that defectors are seeking a more direct political role ahead of a parliamentary election in April. Many are strongly critical of President Moon Jae-in's administration, which they accuse of sidelining defectors and ignoring human rights in a bid to repair relations with North Korea.
Attendees at the launch event discussed cases that have become rallying cries for defectors, who say the South Korean government provides them too little support.
In prominent cases last year, two North Koreans were repatriated, and a defector and her 6-year-old son who had been denied government benefits were found dead of starvation in their Seoul apartment.
South Korea is technically still at war with the North because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with no peace treaty. While unification is still a national goal in South, it is widely seen as an increasingly distant possibility.
Kim Shin-ye, 38, one of the defector participants, said the new party's criticism of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un - one party representative called him a ""little pig"" during the event - means some defectors may be worried about publicly pledging support for fear of endangering family back in the North.
""Some who have families in the North are a bit wary about the launch of the party,"" she said.
More than a thousand North Koreans defected to South Korea in 2019, according to the South's Unification Ministry.
""What Kim Jong Un is the most afraid of is when the dignity of the North Korean defectors is raised,"" said lawmaker Kim Yong-tae, during his congratulatory speech."

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Ethiopia's reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and other officials on Tuesday on a visit expected to focus on security, investment and Ethiopia's dispute with U.S. ally Egypt.
Abiy welcomed Pompeo and his wife on their arrival then they went into lunch.
Their talks are expected to focus on security concerns ahead of Ethiopian elections this year, investment opportunities as Abiy opens up the economy to foreign investment, and a dispute the United States has been trying to mediate between Ethiopia and Egypt over Ethiopia's giant Blue Nile hydropower dam.
Abiy took power in 2018 following years of anti-government protests. He freed political prisoners, won the Nobel Peace Prize for ending a long-running conflict with neighbouring Eritrea, and has begun liberalising sectors of the state-run economy.
Ethiopia, Africa's second-most populous nation, has long been an ally of the United States but the difficulty of doing business in its sluggish and bureaucratic economy has discouraged foreign investment.
Abiy has promised to liberalise the telecoms and banking sectors but this year he is likely to be occupied with elections scheduled for Aug. 29.
His reforms, while applauded abroad, have also unleashed simmering ethnic and political tensions at home as regional powerbrokers jockey for position. More than 2 million of Ethiopia's 109 million citizens have been displaced, according to the United Nations.
Pompeo is on the second leg of a tour that has already taken him to Germany, Senegal and Angola. His visit comes as some African governments are questioning U.S. President Donald Trump's commitment to their continent."

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - More passengers from a cruise ship that docked in Cambodia last week after being turned away at five other ports will fly home on Tuesday, following tests for the new coronavirus, the country's prime minister said.
An American woman who had been on the Westerdam cruise ship tested positive for the virus at the weekend after a special flight chartered by the cruise line reached Malaysia, prompting renewed scrutiny for the hundreds of passengers and crew still on board or ashore in Cambodia.
""Today more than 300 tourists will fly from Phnom Penh to Dubai on a (Boeing (NYSE:BA)) 777 airplane, I have learned from the ship's crew,"" Prime Minister Hun Sen said in a speech.
He said samples from the remaining passengers were being flown by helicopter for testing in the capital, Phnom Penh. Once health officials have confirmed negative results, the tourists will be allowed to disembark.
Holland America Line, which is owned by cruise giant Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp, said 255 guests and 747 crew are still aboard the Westerdam, which docked at the port of Sihanoukville on Friday, awaiting clearance.
""We anticipate this will take several days and greatly appreciate the thoroughness of all authorities involved in resolving this situation,"" a statement from the cruise line said.
Another 406 passengers who had been transferred to Phnom Penh have tested negative for the infection.
""Cleared guests may travel home, and arrangements are being made for those guests,"" the company statement said.
Some 1,455 passengers and 802 crew boarded the cruise ship when it set sail on Feb. 1 from Hong Kong.
The vessel spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand even though the ship said there were no coronavirus cases aboard."

""The Earl and Countess of Snowdon have amicably agreed that their marriage has come to an end and that they shall be divorced,"" a spokesman for the couple said in a statement. 
""They ask that the press respect their privacy and that of their family.""

The news comes after a tough few months for the queen. 
Prince Harry and wife Meghan plunged the royal family into crisis in January when they announced they were cutting back on official duties. Harry said last year he felt Megan had faced ""bullying"" from some British tabloid newspapers.
The queen's second son, Prince Andrew, stepped down from public duties in November over his connections to U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was facing charges of trafficking underage girls for sex when he killed himself last year.

Last week, the queen's eldest grandson Peter Phillips and wife Autumn said they were divorcing after 12 years of marriage.

""On Monday, a German citizen returned home. He was arrested while ago and was sentenced to three years in jail for taking pictures from sensitive places,"" judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said in a televised weekly news conference. He did not give further details.
Iran said on Monday that Ahmad Khalili, who was arrested in Germany on a U.S. request and subject to extradition to the United States, flew home on Sunday with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who had been in Germany to attend a security conference in Munich.
""We insisted that first the Iranian citizen should return home...then the German citizen was allowed to leave Iran on Monday,"" he said.
Iran's Revolutionary Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals over recent years, mostly on espionage charges.
Esmaili also said two French academics will appear in the court next month. France has called for the release of French-Iranian academic Fariba Adelkhah and her French colleague Roland Marchal, who had been detained since June.
Iran has rejected France's call as an interference at Tehran's state matters.
""We do not recognize dual nationality. She is Iranian. We do not let other states to interfere in our judiciary matters. Their court session will be on March 3,"" Esmaili said.
Adelkhah's lawyer told Reuters last month that Iran had dropped spying charges against Adelkhah but she faced other security-related charges.
The issue has complicated ties between Tehran and Paris, both parties to a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Washington exited the deal in 2018 and has reimposed sanctions that has hit Iran's economy hard.
Rights activists have accused Iran of arresting a number of dual nationals to try to win concessions from other countries - a charge that the Islamic Republic has regularly dismissed.
A Chinese-American detained in Iran in 2016 and later charged with spying was freed in December and an imprisoned Iranian was released by Washington in return."

Last week, Annegret-Kramp Karrenbauer, Merkel's protegee, threw the party into turmoil by saying she would not stand as chancellor in the next federal election, due by Oct. 2021, and announcing that she would give up the CDU party chair. 
Roettgen's unexpected move makes him the fourth contender for the post of party leader.
Roettgen has something of a national profile due to his role as head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee but is not seen as a big hitter in the party. He also served as an environment minister under Merkel from 2009 to 2012.
Roettgen has in the past been seen as someone who could work with the Greens, currently the second-biggest party in polls after the conservative bloc.
In a letter quoted by the regional newspaper Rheinische Post to outgoing CDU leader Kramp-Karrenbauer, Roettgen said the situation was ""so serious that it was about the future of the CDU and what that meant for the stability of Germany"".
The other CDU leadership contenders are Friedrich Merz, a former archrival to Merkel who is an economic liberal, right-wing health minister Jens Spahn and Armin Laschet, premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state. A centrist, Laschet is seen as a continuity candidate.

The CDU leader is likely to be chancellor candidate for the conservative bloc but the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party to the CDU - could also put forward a candidate.

Irish unity would be supported by just 29% of voters, with 52% against, the poll of 2,000 people organized by Liverpool University and Britain's Economic and Social Research Council found. The remaining 19% said they did not know how they would vote.
If 'don't knows' are excluded, the figures show 65% to 35% in favor of remaining within the United Kingdom, the survey showed.
""The data offers an antidote to excitable recent commentary concerning the imminence of Irish unity,"" said Jon Tonge, Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool who led the survey.
But he added that the poll indicated a 2% rise in support for Irish unification since the last poll in 2017, a rate of increase that would produce a majority for a united Ireland within two decades.
Under Northern Ireland's 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, which largely ended decades of violence between mainly Catholic nationalists seeking to merge with Ireland and Protestant unionists who want to remain part of the United Kingdom, the British government can call a referendum if a ""yes"" majority looks likely.
Sinn Fein, an Irish nationalist party in both Ireland and Northern Ireland which won the most votes in an Irish election earlier this month, has said it wants London to hold a poll within five years.
Asked to label themselves ideologically, 28% chose 'unionist', 25% 'nationalist' and 40% said neither.
The vast majority of self-identified nationalists supported a united Ireland and the vast majority of unionists were against. But there was also a clear majority against unification among people who defined themselves as neither, with 73% saying they would support remaining in the United Kingdom.

Authorities have carried out a sustained crackdown on alleged followers of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen since the failed bid in July 2016, in which about 250 people were killed. 
Police still routinely carry out raids targeting suspects.
The latest operations marked an escalation by police against alleged supporters of Gulen, a one-time ally of President Tayyip Erdogan who subsequently became his arch foe.
Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied any involvement in the attempted coup.
In the latest moves, prosecutors ordered the arrest of 157 people, including 101 serving officers, in an investigation of the Turkish Armed Forces, state-owned Anadolu news agency said.
About 100 people have so far been detained in this operation, the private Demiroren news agency reported.
In the capital Ankara, 71 people were to be detained in an investigation targeting alleged Gulen supporters in the justice ministry, Anadolu said.
It subsequently reported that prosecutors had issued arrest warrants for another 467 suspects across the country over links to Gulen as part of an investigation into corruption in police examinations held in 2009.
Erdogan has for years accused Gulen's supporters of establishing a ""parallel state"" by infiltrating the police, judiciary and other state institutions.
Since the coup attempt, about 80,000 people have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others sacked or suspended from their jobs.

Turkey's Western allies including the European Union as well as rights groups have criticized the scale of the crackdown, while Ankara has defended the measures as a necessary response to the security threat.

With the subway, trains and public buses at a standstill, many commuters were forced to drive to work, leaving major traffic arteries into the sprawling city of almost four million blocked.
Striking workers were expected to march to parliament around midday.
Greece, which required three international bailouts between 2010 and 2015, has cut state pensions several times in recent years to make the system more viable.
Draft legislation pending parliamentary approval creates a digital social security registry, and introduces more flexibility for the self-employed over contributions, delinking pensions from earnings.
Labor unions say the reforms are a thinly-disguised attempt by the governing conservatives to privatize pension funds, and accuse them of reneging on a promise to rescind all bailout-mandated cuts.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2020 12:14AM ET</span>",'From bad to worse' - Dashed hopes may deter many Iranians from polls,"By Babak Dehghanpisheh
DUBAI (Reuters) - Confrontation with America, economic hardship and an airline tragedy have battered Iranians' confidence in their leaders, posing a potential problem for the authorities in a parliamentary election this week.
As the Feb. 21 vote nears, Iranians are in a gloomy mood, exhausted by a succession of crises that have helped to shred the hopes for a better life they harbored only four years ago.
That does not bode well for leaders seeking a big turnout at the ballot box: In their view, crowded polling stations would signal to arch-foe Washington that Iran is unbowed by sanctions and the killing of a prominent general in a U.S. strike.
Allies of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have ensured hardliners dominate the field -- meaning that, whatever the turnout, security hawks seeking a more confrontational approach with Washington may tighten their control of the legislature.
But a meager showing would still rattle Iran's leaders and embolden critics both in the country and outside who argue the Islamic Republic needs to change domestic and foreign policy.
""I'm a person who has voted before. My hope was that things would get a little better when I voted in the past. Now, all the red lines have been crossed,"" said a doctor in Tehran whose clinic is struggling to source specialized medicine.
""This time, I have no hope and I will definitely not vote,” she said by phone, asking not to be identified discussing political matters. 
Four years ago, things looked very different. Rouhani and his allies won big gains in parliamentary elections, and many hoped a nuclear deal agreed with world powers in 2015 would pull Iran out of political isolation and boost the economy. 
""WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY PROGRESS""
Those aspirations crumbled after President Donald Trump quit the pact in 2018 and reimposed sanctions in an effort to put stricter limits on Iran's nuclear work, curb its ballistic missile program and end its involvement in regional proxy wars.
""The main root of everything is the economy,"" Ali, a mobile phone shop employee in the central city of Isfahan, said by telephone, asking not to reveal his surname.
""If an individual doesn't have the money to take home bread to his wife and family then he'll stop praying and even lose his beliefs,"" said Ali, who works more hours since his boss kept the store open in traditional afternoon resting periods in the hope customers could wander in. Ali does not plan to vote next week.
""I voted for several years and it didn't make any difference. We haven't seen any progress to say we want this or that candidate to come forward,"" he said.
The authorities have been under pressure since last year when protests over a fuel price hike were met with the bloodiest crackdown since the 1979 Islamic revolution, killing hundreds.
A U.S. drone strike that felled top commander Qassem Soleimani in January in Iraq rallied Iranians around a common cause. But the show of support was quickly replaced by angry protests over efforts to cover up the accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian airliner that killed all 176 aboard.
The elite Revolutionary Guards apologized for the calamity, but that did not appease thousands protesting in several cities.
""This year, things are going from bad to worse,"" said a Tehran resident and homemaker, who does not plan to vote and also asked not to be named.
""After the plane crash, the government has lost a lot of their supporters,"" said the resident, who added that the establishment needed the election to show the world ""how many supporters they have"" after the string of crises. 
Even before the latest troubles, sanctions that cut Iran's crude oil exports by more than 80 percent were placing a painful squeeze on living standards. 
The rial has slumped, trading on the free market at about 140,000 against the dollar against its official rate of 42,000, according to foreign exchange website Bonbast.com
VOTING FOR ""HARD REVENGE""
The currency plunge has disrupted Iran’s foreign trade and boosted inflation, which the IMF expects at 31% this year.
In the eastern city of Birjand, Hamed said he has no time for elections as he frets about his business filming and photographing weddings, with only one in 10 customers asking for albums after the cost of photo paper rose six-fold since 2018.
""We're focused on prices and having to call customers and asking them to pay,"" Hamed told Reuters by phone, also declining to give his surname due to sensitivities. ""We have nothing to do with politicians and politics.""
Analysts expect a lower turnout than the 62% in the 2016 parliamentary elections, with smaller, more conservative cities where families pressure kin to vote seeing a larger showing.
But Khamenei, Iran's highest authority, has tried to drum up nationalistic sentiment to secure a strong turnout.
""It's possible that someone doesn't like me but if they like Iran they must come to the ballot box,"" he said in a speech.
Supporters echoed the call on social media.

""A better election can also be another #hard_revenge,"" a Twitter user named Teiaaraa posted two weeks ago, referring to a phrase used by state media for the Iranian strikes on Iraq bases that left over 100 U.S. soldiers with traumatic brain injuries.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Relatives of a seven-year-old girl murdered in Mexico said on Monday the government had failed to protect her despite their pleas, while President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador appeared to blame the crime on neo-liberal economics.
Fatima Cecilia Aldrighett went missing on Feb. 11. Her body was discovered over the weekend in a plastic garbage bag in Mexico City's Tlahuac neighborhood, days after another murder of a young woman triggered angry protests.
Sonia Lopez, Aldrighett's aunt, said the girl could have been found alive if authorities had listened to the family.
""Fatima is not with us because the protocols were not followed, because the institutions did not give the attention they should have,"" Lopez said, her voice breaking with emotion as she spoke to reporters. ""We will not forget her.""
Lopez said precious hours were wasted after Aldrighett was reported missing. She also said social services had not heeded calls to help the girl's mother, who has health problems, support her daughter.
Mexico City's attorney general and mayor promised justice and offered a $107,000 reward for information. The attorney general, Ernestina Godoy Ramos, said she would review the office's handling of the case.
""The full institution has been activated for the investigation,"" she told reporters. 
Asked about the girl's death, Lopez Obrador said he was sure authorities would catch the perpetrators, but said punishment alone was not the solution.
The bigger challenge, he said, was to purify Mexican society, which he said had ""fallen into decline, a progressive degradation that has to do with the neo-liberal model.""
Lopez Obrador regularly blames problems such as corruption, poverty and violence on policies implemented during the era of pro-market policies such as economic liberalization starting in the 1980s.
Family members and parents protested on Monday outside Aldrighett's home and her school, where she was seen leaving accompanied by an adult woman last week. #JuticiaParaFatima, or Justice for Fatima, was tweeted 179,000 times and her name was a top global trend.
Footage on Twitter showed residents of the girl's neighborhood pushing and shouting as they held signs demanding justice.
The girl's grandfather, Guillermo Anton Godinez, standing outside the family's modest home, said Lopez Obrador could not blame only his predecessors for Mexico's problems. 
""Now he is in charge, he is president... He should show us he is different.""
Social media users noted other countries with free-market economies do not suffer the levels of gender violence seen in Mexico.
Women on Friday daubed the words ""femicide state"" in blood-red on the door of Mexico's National Palace and demanded justice for 25-year-old Ingrid Escamilla, whose killer skinned her body last week. 
Lopez Obrador on Monday asked the protesters not to paint the palace, saying his government was working to end the murder of women.

An average of 10 women a day are killed in Mexico and the year 2019, the first of Lopez Obrador's government, set an overall homicide record, according to official data. Victims of femicide increased 10% in 2019 to over 1,000.

(Reuters) - Floodwaters in central Mississippi appeared to hit their peak on Monday, potentially allowing the area around the state capital Jackson to avoid any casualties after the Pearl River reached its highest level in 37 years, officials said.
The Pearl River rose to its third-highest point in recorded history after heavy rains last week filled the Ross Barnett Reservoir to capacity, forcing managers on Saturday to begin releasing water into the river just upstream from Jackson.
The floods submerged streets in low-lying areas, prompting 16 search-and-rescue operations to pluck stranded people from their homes, Governor Tate Reeves said.
Reeves declared a state of emergency on Saturday, one day after the city of Jackson issued a seven-day mandatory evacuation order for low-lying areas.
""After days of rising floodwaters, we do have some positive news to report this morning,"" Reeves told a news conference on Monday. ""It appears the Pearl River is currently at 36.74 feet (11.2 meters) and we that believe it is expected to be at or near its crest at this moment.""
However, the governor also warned that ""we as a state are not in the clear yet"" as areas downstream of Jackson could be vulnerable and the pace of the stream would increase as waters recede, making attempts to traverse flooded streets potentially dangerous.
Officials estimated 2,000 buildings including 1,000 homes would be in the danger zone and distributed 156,000 sandbags for people to protect their homes.
It was too early to estimate the number of damaged homes but there had been no injuries as of Monday morning, officials said.
Only 24 people elected to stay in shelters provided by the state, Reeves said. Frank Elliott of Jackson decided to stay home even though water began to cover his street.
""If the water does come up, I do have a canoe. And I'll have friends pick me up at the church so I can row around the corner and to the church and go wherever I need to go,"" Elliott told WAPT television news.
The river rose to its highest level since reaching 39.6 feet in 1983.
The record peak of 43.3 feet (13.2 meters) in 1979 forced more than 17,000 people in the Jackson area from their homes and placed much of the capital city under water, according to the Pearl River Vision Foundation, a private, nonprofit arm of the local flood control district."

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (Reuters) - Charles Portis, the reclusive Arkansas writer known for the classic Western novel ""True Grit"" and the wry humor that filled his works, died on Monday at the age of 86 after battling a long illness, the New York Times reported.
Portis wrote five novels, numerous magazine articles and short stories and one stage play.
Portis' death was confirmed by his brother Jonathan, who told the Times that the author had been in hospice care for two years and in a care facility for Alzheimer's patients before that.
Portis' 1968 novel ""True Grit,"" which was serialized by the Saturday Evening Post, spent 22 weeks on the New York Times' best-seller list. It was set in the 1870s and told the tale of Mattie Ross, a 14-year-old girl who enlists a one-eyed marshal named Rooster Cogburn to find the man who killed her father.
The film was twice made into a movie. The 1969 version starred John Wayne as Cogburn and earned him an Academy Award for best actor. Joel and Ethan Coen wrote and directed a new version in 2010 that was nominated for 10 Oscars.
In recent decades, Portis rarely gave interviews. But in a 1984 New York Times article, he spoke about his writing style - banging away at typewriter keys with two fingers.
""I write in a little office without a phone, behind a beer joint called Cash McCoo's,"" he said. ""For $85 a month, you can't beat it.""
Before becoming a novelist, Portis served in the U.S. Marines in the 1950-53 Korean War and earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism from the University of Arkansas in 1958. He was a reporter for the Northwest Arkansas Times in Fayetteville and the Memphis Commercial Appeal, his family said.
He eventually became the London bureau chief for the New York Herald Tribune, and wrote about the U.S. civil rights struggle in the South for the newspaper.
Another novel, ""Norwood,"" was made into a movie and did well at the box office. The 1966 novel tells the story of a road trip from Texas to New York and back.
Portis' articles, short stories and memoirs were published in such magazines as the Saturday Evening Post, the New Yorker and the Atlantic."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's New South Wales state said on Tuesday it will ease water restrictions after a deluge of rains filled dams across the country's east coast to their highest levels in more than two years.
New South Wales (NSW), home to about a third of Australia's 25 million people and its biggest city Sydney, in December imposed water restrictions for the first time in a decade following three years of drought.
But with 400mm (15.8 inches) of rain falling in some parts of the state earlier this month, the NSW state government said curbs will now be eased from March 1 when the quality of the water in the dams is expected to have improved.
Water supplies were tainted by ash and fire debris after the state's worst ever wildfires, which burnt through millions of acres of bushland and killed more than 30 people nationwide this summer.
""A number of initiatives are in place to ensure the water is safe for use, including extensive testing, filtration and nets to catch debris, but we are allowing an extra two weeks purely as a precautionary measure,"" said Melinda Pavey, NSW water minister in an emailed statement.
Residents in the state will now be able to use hoses, though they will need to be fitted with a control nozzles to ensure supplies are not exhausted too quickly, the state government said.
The NSW state government had been forced to impose the water limits after some parts of the state had less than a year's worth of drinking water left. Several towns had begun trucking in fresh water from other parts of the country.
But the threat eased significantly when storms lashed NSW earlier this month.
While the wild weather felled trees and washed debris into the state's waterways, dam levels soared.
The Warragamba Dam, which supplies about four-fifths of Sydney's water, is now more than 80% full - up more than a third in just the last week - and at its highest level since January 2018."

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese authorities have arrested a prominent rights activist and legal scholar who had called on President Xi Jinping to step down over his handling of crises including the coronavirus outbreak, two fellow activists said on Monday.
Xu Zhiyong had been on the run since December after attending a gathering in the southern city of Xiamen which focused on discussion of human rights in China, according to Hua Ze, an activist and friend of Xu's. Four others who had attended the gathering in December were arrested previously, Hua told Reuters.
Xu was arrested on Saturday night by the Beijing police with assistance by police in Guangzhou, Hua said.
The Beijing and Guangzhou city police did not respond immediately to faxed requests for comment.
Xu's girlfriend, who was in Beijing, has not been reachable since Saturday, according to U.S.-based Human Rights Watch China researcher Yaqiu Wang.
Xu, a long-time activist for judicial and legal reform, in 2012 founded the New Citizens Movement, which called on government officials to disclose their wealth. He was sentenced in 2014 to four years in prison for his work with the group.
In recent weeks, Xu had written many articles criticising Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 70,000 people in China and killed 1,770.
In a Feb 4 article published on a website that is blocked in China and belongs to the New Citizens Movement, Xu called on Chinese President Xi Jinping to resign, citing his handling of crises, from Hong Kong's anti-government protests to the epidemic that originated in the central city of Wuhan.
""Medical supplies are tight, and the hospitals are overcrowded with people, and a large number of those infected are unable to have their cases verified,"" Xu wrote. ""You say you personally directed the deployment, it is a mess.""
""Mr. Xi Jinping, please give way,"" he wrote.
Xu also criticized restrictions on Chinese media reporting of the epidemic centered in Wuhan and the strict lockdown measures implemented to contain it."

854,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 07:19PM ET</span>",Tokyo commuters bound for Olympic crowd crush as Japan Inc rules out work from home,"By Chris Gallagher
TOKYO (Reuters) - When Emi Tanimura failed to find a daycare slot for her new-born daughter, she had to take a radical step for Japan to avoid a long time away from her job at communications firm Sunny Side Up (T:2180). She started working from home.
Now a mother of two, she still works flexible hours, including time at home, as director of the Sunny Side Up president's office - with her boss's blessing - taking care of both her family responsibilities and career.
Tanimura is a rare exception to the rule in hard-driving corporate Japan, where employees often feel pressured to put in long hours in the office.
In a Reuters poll, 83% of Japanese companies said they don't currently allow employees to work from home. And 73% of firms surveyed said they aren't considering allowing what Japan often refers to as 'telework', or telecommuting, during this summer's Tokyo Olympic Games, according to the survey conducted from Jan. 30 to Feb. 12.
""To be honest, at first I felt sorry because everyone was working in the office and only I was at home,"" Tanimura said at the company's headquarters, just over a five-minute walk from the new Olympic stadium. ""But I was being evaluated in terms of whether I achieved results ... my performance didn't decline.""
The aversion to allowing work from home is unwelcome news for the government, which wants companies to let their employees telecommute during the Olympics to make travel easier for Games participants and spectators on Tokyo's notoriously packed trains and roadways.
It also points to a potential headache amid growing concern about the coronavirus epidemic that had killed nearly 1,800 in mainland China as of Monday and has spread to a number of countries in Asia including Japan. While companies elsewhere are drawing up contingency plans with large portions of staff working from home in a bid to contain the virus, most Japanese firms would have to implement radical change to follow suit.
The push to encourage working from home chimes with a broader campaign by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government urging more flexible work hours to make it easier for women with children to take up jobs as Japan battles a severe labour shortage because of its fast-aging population.
Parissa Haghirian, a professor of international management at Sophia University in Tokyo, said she wasn't surprised by the survey results because of structural issues found in traditional white-collar Japanese offices that favor hiring workers with general skillsets, rather than specialists, who are moved between divisions every few years.
Haghirian said the switching of roles leaves general workers needing more collective support: Work processes are not as clearly defined and documented as in Western companies, making it harder to work independently. A culture accustomed to group interaction also plays a part.
""You have this structure where people are always there (in the workplace) and do everything together. That strongly affects how people see work and do their work,"" Haghirian said. ""It's very difficult to change that.""
NO KNOW-HOW
To be sure, some survey respondents said they were not considering introducing telework during the Olympics because their businesses required them to be in physical locations - such as retail stores - or they were not based in Tokyo.
But others said they simply did not have a flexible-work policy in place, or did not have the technological set-up to allow people to work remotely.
""We don't have any telework know-how,"" one manager at a machinery maker wrote in response to the survey.
Still, some early adopters are bucking the trend.
Staffing services firm Pasona (T:2168) implemented its flexible-work program in 2017, offering telecommuting from home or satellite offices to its roughly 10,000 group employees.
Employees receive a laptop that requires fingerprint authentication and must take an online training course and pass a test in order to be eligible, said Akiko Hosokawa, general manager of Pasona's human resources division.
Pasona is still considering specifics for the Olympic period, Hosokawa said. The company is currently urging employees worried about the coronavirus to take advantage of off-peak commuting rather than travel in rush hours, she said.
Elsewhere, companies including drinks giant Asahi Group Holdings (T:2502) and tech conglomerate Fujitsu (T:6702) said they would encourage employees to telecommute during the Olympics to avoid travel to the office.
And Sunny Side Up said employees like Tanimura would be telecommuting during the entire Olympic and Paralympic periods because of its location close to the Olympic stadium."

GENEVA (Reuters) - The latest data provided by China on people infected with coronavirus indicates a decline in new cases but ""every scenario is still on the table"" in terms of the epidemic's evolution, the World Health Organization said on Monday.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said that a published Chinese paper on more than 44,000 confirmed cases provided insight into the age range of infected people, disease severity and mortality rates.
""The data also appear to show a decline in new cases,"" he told reporters. ""This trend must be interpreted very cautiously. Trends can change as new populations are affected.
""It's too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,"" he said.
China had reported 70,635 cases of COVID-19, including 1,772 deaths, Tedros said. In the past 24 hours, China had reported 2,051 new cases, including both lab-confirmed results and cases based on clinical observation, usually a chest scan.
Fewer than 700 cases had been reported by 25 other countries, he said.
Dr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO's emergencies program, said: ""The real issue is whether we are seeing efficient community transmission outside of China and at the present time we are not observing that.""
Referring to China, he said the virus was attacking about out four of every 100,000 people, even within its epicenter in Wuhan city and surrounding Hubei province.
""This is a very serious outbreak and it has the potential to grow. But we need to balance that in terms of the number of people affected. Outside Hubei, this epidemic is affecting a very tiny, tiny, tiny proportion of people,"" Ryan said.
""So if we are going to disrupt every cruise ship in the world on the off-chance that there may be some potential contact with some potential pathogen, then where do we stop? We shut down the buses around the world?""
There was no such thing as zero risk, Ryan said, calling for basing decisions on cruise ships and meetings on solid evidence.
Tedros added: ""Measures should be taken proportionate to the situation, based on public health science and evidence. And blanket measures may not help.""
The quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, with 3,700 passengers total, held by far the largest cluster of cases outside China with more than 400 people testing positive.
Dr. Sylvie Briand, WHO director of global infectious hazard preparedness, said the agency was working closely with Japanese authorities and the chief medical officer on the vessel docked off Yokohama on infections and evacuations.
""Our focus is on our public health objective that we contain the virus and not contain the people,"" she said."
856,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 05:16PM ET</span>","UK PM's adviser quits after backlash over contraception, IQ comments","LONDON (Reuters) - An adviser to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who had discussed the benefits of forced contraception quit on Monday, saying ""media hysteria"" about his old online posts meant he had become a distraction for the government.
Earlier, Johnson's spokesman repeatedly refused to comment when asked about Andrew Sabisky, whose appointment drew widespread criticism after the Mail on Sunday newspaper reported statements made in his name online in 2014 and 2016.
In addition to posts on contraception, Sabisky also said data showed the U.S. black population had lower IQ than white people, and, in a 2016 interview with digital publication Schools Week, discussed the benefits of genetic selection. 
Media reported Sabisky was hired following an unusual appeal earlier this year from Johnson's senior adviser Dominic Cummings for ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"" to help bring new ideas to Britain's government.
His resignation is a blow to that effort, which had attracted criticism from those who said Cummings was sidestepping normal government recruitment processes.
""The media hysteria about my old stuff online is mad but I wanted to help (the government) not be a distraction,"" Sabisky said on Twitter.
""Accordingly I've decided to resign as a contractor ... I signed up to do real work, not be in the middle of a giant character assassination: if I can't do the work properly there's no point.""
Sabisky, who has referred to himself as a ""super forecaster"", said he hoped Johnson's office hired more people with ""good geopolitical forecasting track records"" and that the ""media learn to stop selective quoting"".
Both the opposition Labour Party and at least two of Johnson's own Conservatives had called for him to be fired.
""Andrew Sabisky’s presence in No.10 is a poor reflection on the government and there is no way to defend it. He needs to go. ‘Weirdos’ and ‘misfits’ are all very well, but please can they not gratuitously cause offence,"" Conservative lawmaker William Wragg wrote on Twitter before Sabisky resigned. 
An account in Sabisky's name made the comments about black IQ in a reply to a 2014 blog post written by an American professor discussing education disabilities in the United States. 
In 2016, replying to a blog post written by Cummings, an account in Sabisky's name said:
""One way to get around the problems of unplanned pregnancies creating a permanent underclass would be to legally enforce universal uptake of long-term contraception at the onset of puberty. Vaccination laws give it a precedent, I would argue.""

Johnson's spokesman earlier repeatedly refused to comment on whether Johnson shared Sabisky's views, saying only that the prime minister's own views were well known. He would not confirm the nature of Sabisky's role.

Announcing the measure on Twitter, Vice President Delcy Rodriguez left open the possibility of applying fines and other measures in the future.
""Venezuela must be respected,"" Rodriguez said.
Guaido returned to Venezuela's main airport on a TAP flight last Tuesday after a three-week international tour aimed at drumming up support for his campaign to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen an economic collapse and is accused of corruption and human rights violations.
Authorities then detained Guaido's uncle, who was traveling with him on the flight from Portugal, accusing him of bringing explosive material into the country. Guaido, who is recognized as Venezuela's legitimate president by more than 50 countries, dismissed those allegations as baseless.
TAP said in a statement on Monday it complied with all legal and safety requirements by authorities in both Portugal and Venezuela, and did not understand the reasons for the suspension.
""This is a serious measure which harms our passengers, without the company even having been given a chance to counter the accusation,"" TAP said.
Portugal's government said last Friday it would open an investigation into the incident in light of Venezuela's accusations.
Maduro calls Guaido, who presides over the opposition-held National Assembly, a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a coup. His government had placed a travel ban on Guaido, which the opposition leader violated in January by traveling secretly to Colombia."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Hermes Soto, who turned 5 on Monday, will not be celebrating his birthday with friends. Instead, he is bracing for his 15th chemotherapy session to tackle a rare but aggressive form of cancer that threatens to kill him.
For his mother, Esperanza Paz, the ordeal is compounded by fears of another round of shortages in the supply of the life-saving vincristine drug needed to treat the soft-tissue cancer in her son's forearm. 
""He can relapse. The cancer can come back,"" said Paz, after a vital round of chemotherapy was delayed by a week in mid-January due to vincristine shortages in his Mexico City hospital.
""The concern is that Hermes is now in the final stage of his treatment. We only need two cycles of chemotherapy to finish,"" added Paz, a crafts-maker who lives with her three small children in a modest home in the capital.
Hermes, who has undergone three surgeries since October 2018, is one of dozens of children whose cancer treatment has been imperilled by shortages following a procurement shake-up by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's government, which centralized drug purchases to reduce corruption and overpricing.
Lawyer Andrea Rocha represents parents of more than 60 children, mostly cancer patients, who have been unable to find the correct medicines in Mexico in recent months. She has filed lawsuits aimed at compelling the government to give the children medicine.
The festering issue has morphed into a major headache for Lopez Obrador, popular for his promises to improve the lot of Mexico's most vulnerable. Images of sick children and distraught parents criticizing the government from crowded hospital wards have led to tough questions aimed at the president in news conferences.
Lopez Obrador has said in recent weeks that Mexico now has enough medicines. He said scarcity in recent months was linked to Mexican pharmaceutical distributors who were resisting the procurement changes, along with hospital officials who he said hoarded medicines and supply issues from drug companies in China and India.
The president's office and the health ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Sporadic shortages of medicines predate Lopez Obrador, but the rise in protests from parents is a sign the problem has worsened. [nL4N2332WL] Mexico's National Human Rights Commission, an independent government body, said it had received more than 500 complaints about shortages since November. 
""We didn't have a first-rate health system before but since the change of administration, the problem of shortages has grown immensely,"" said Rocha. ""There has never been such a big crisis.""
For a while, some parents were able to deal with the problem by forking out extra cash to buy prescription medicine in private pharmacies. But they say some drugs are now unavailable even privately.
On Jan. 1, the government scrapped the Popular Insurance healthcare system, which charged fees and had a membership system. Instead, it launched a universal healthcare system that is free at point of use, the Health Institute for Wellbeing, or Insabi.
""The president tells us that there will be a total supply from December 1. But cancer does not wait,"" said Paz, referring to Lopez Obrador's recent comments that Insabi would provide access to free medicine and a health system comparable to Denmark's before the end of the year.
Denmark allocates more than 10% of its GDP to health, while Mexico contributes 5.9%.
ORGAN FAILURE
Childhood cancer is the second-highest cause of death among children in Mexico, according to official figures. Each year, an average of 2,300 children die from 7,500 new cases. 
While official data is not available, parents say two young boys died because of the lack of medicine in recent months.
The shortages are also impacting non-cancer patients, including children who underwent organ transplants.
This is particularly dangerous for children such as 7 year-old Diana, who has had 19 operations and had to wait four years for a kidney transplant.
Her mother, Monica Marquez, a 41-year-old handicraft seller, said she had to pay out of pocket and rely on donations to buy Tacrolimus and Mycophenolic acid, two vital immunosuppressive drugs for her daughter. 
But shortages have caused the price of Tacrolimus to shoot up from 2,500 pesos ($135) to 14,000 pesos ($755) for a two-week dose, making it unaffordable for low-income families.
Fearing her daughter will relapse and ""go back to the way she was before,"" Marquez's frustration with the government grows.

""I feel that they are underplaying it,"" she said. ""They are trying to cover the sun with a finger when clearly there is a very big problem.""

""Obviously we will develop our own state aid system, our own anti-subsidy regime once the transition is over,"" David Frost told an audience after delivering a lecture at a Brussels university.
The EU wants Britain to accepts its rules and regulations on state aid as part of a tariff- and quota-free trade deal to guard against unfair competition with a large competitor on its doorstep.
Frost said that the UK was not prepared to compromise on the fundamental parts of its negotiating position with the EU, and was ""not frightened"" by suggestions there would be trade frictions and barriers as a result of the deal ultimately agreed.
He added that it was perfectly possible to be both an economic competitor and political partner with the EU in the future.
He said the UK was ""not asking for anything special"", just a normal trade agreement that the EU has with other countries around the world."

The EU does not have a free trade agreement with Australia, and so such an arrangement would effectively be a trade relationship governed by World Trade Organization rules.
David Frost told a university lecture in Brussels that Britain, which left the EU at the end of January, wanted a trade agreement similar to that which Canada has with the bloc when a transition period ends on Dec. 31, 2020.
EU negotiators have said that for a Canada-style deal, Britain would have to adopt a level playing field with the bloc on state aid, environment, employment and other regulations to guard against unfair competition with the European single market.
Frost said that whatever trade friction Britain faces when the transition period ends, his country would aim to minimize it as much as possible through customs facilitation."

The U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq said it had received credible allegations of protesters being targeted with hunting rifles, stones and firebombs on the nights of Feb. 14-16, leading to at least 50 injuries.
At least 150 people were injured in the Shi'ite Muslim holy city of Kerbala in January alone due to similar tactics, UNAMI said in a statement.
""The continued pattern of the use of excessive force, with ambiguously identified armed groups and unclear loyalties, is a grave security concern that must be tackled urgently and decisively. Peaceful protesters should be protected at all times,"" said Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Iraq.
There was no immediate comment from Iraqi authorities.
Iraq is facing an extraordinary domestic crisis as nearly 500 people have been killed since October in protests demanding the ouster of what demonstrators see as a corrupt ruling elite and an end to foreign interference mainly by Iran and the United States.
At least nine people were wounded on Monday in Baghdad during renewed clashes between protesters and security forces, police sources said. Two were wounded because of birdshot and the rest suffered teargas-related injures.
Prime Minister-designate Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi said on Saturday a new government would be formed in the coming week.

Allawi appealed to Iraqis for their support hours after his appointment by President Barham Salih earlier this month, but protesters have already rejected him as a stooge of the political elite.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan could send former leader Omar al-Bashir and other suspects to The Hague for trial before the International Criminal Court, but any decision would need approval from military and civilian rulers, the information minister said on Monday.
Sudanese authorities said last week that they had agreed for Bashir and three other suspects to appear before the ICC, without giving details of how this could happen.
""One possibility is that the ICC will come here so they will be appearing before the ICC in Khartoum, or there will be a hybrid court maybe, or maybe they are going to transfer them to The Hague...That will be discussed with the ICC,"" Information Minister Faisal Salih told Reuters.
Sudan's offer to cooperate with the ICC marks an important step in rebuilding relations with the international community after three decades during which the country was isolated and sanctioned for its links with Islamist militants and the violence in Darfur.
Bashir, who has been jailed in Khartoum since he was toppled after mass protests last year, is wanted by the ICC for alleged war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Sudan's troubled Darfur region.
Bashir's lawyer has said the ex-president refused any dealings with the ICC because it was a ""political court"".
The different options for the ICC proceedings would be discussed with an ICC delegation that was expected to visit Khartoum, Salih said.
He said he thought any decision would need approval by Sudan's High Peace Council, which includes the military-led Sovereign Council, senior cabinet members, and representatives of political groups that opposed Bashir.
The High Peace Council had agreed to the appearance of the suspects before the ICC before its decision was announced last week at peace talks in Juba, South Sudan, Salih said.
The transitional government is also trying to get Sudan removed from a list of countries the United States considers state sponsors of terrorism. Sudan was placed on the list in 1993.
Though U.S. sanctions on Sudan were lifted in 2017, the listing has hampered commercial transactions and international payments and prevents Sudan from negotiating a settlement over its debt and thereby accessing sorely needed funds from international financial institutions.
One of the conditions for removing Sudan from the list was offering compensation for the victims of the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole warship. Sudan said last week it had agreed to do that.
Another condition is paying compensation to the families of victims killed in attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.
""The minister of justice thinks that in a very short time we are going to have an agreement with those families,"" Salih said.
Other outstanding issues being discussed with the United States include reform of the security sector, making progress in the peace process in Juba with rebel factions from Darfur and other regions, and Sudan's relationship with North Korea.

""There is some progress being made on this, but we are still waiting for a positive response from the Americans,"" Salih said.

A top emergency expert at the World Health Organization (WHO) said later that using convalescent plasma was a ""very valid"" approach to test, but that it was important to get the timing right to maximize the boost to a patient's immunity.
The coronavirus epidemic is believed to have originated in a seafood market in the central city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, and has so far killed 1,770 people and infected more than 70,000 in mainland China.
China's financial hub of Shanghai on Monday had 332 infected cases, one of whom died in recent weeks. Lu Hongzhou, professor and co-director of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, said that 184 cases were still hospitalized, including 166 mild cases, while 18 were in serious and critical conditions.
He said the hospital had set up a special clinic to administer plasma therapy and was selecting patients who were willing to donate. The blood would be screened to check if he or she had other diseases like hepatitis B or C, he added.
""We are positive that this method can be very effective in our patients,"" he said.
There are no fully licensed treatments or vaccines against the new coronavirus, and the process of developing and testing drugs can take many months and even years.
'VERY IMPORTANT AREA'
Convalescent plasma has been proven ""effective and life-saving"" against other infectious diseases, including rabies and diphtheria, Dr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies program, told reporters in Geneva.
""It is a very important area to pursue,"" Ryan said.
""Because what hyperimmune globulin does is it concentrates the antibodies in a recovered patient. You are essentially giving the new victim's immune system a boost of antibodies to hopefully get them through the very difficult phase.
""So it must be given at the right time, because it mops up the virus in the system, and it just gives the new patient's immune system a vital push at the time it needs it. But it has to be carefully timed and it's not always successful.""
Ryan added: ""So it is a very important area of discovery, and I believe they are starting trials on that in China. But it is a very valid way to explore therapeutics, especially when we don't have vaccines and we don't have specific antivirals.""
As well as using plasma therapies, the Chinese doctors are also trying antiviral drugs licensed for use against other infections to see if they might help.
Scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are due in weeks, while the head of a Wuhan hospital had said plasma infusions from recovered patients had shown some encouraging preliminary results."

Tunis (Reuters) - Tunisian President Kais Saied said on Monday he would dissolve parliament and call for an early election if the new government fails to win a parliamentary confidence vote amid what he called the worst political crisis since independence in 1956. 
Designated prime minister Elyes Fakhfakh proposed the line-up of a new government on Saturday and then said negotiations would continue after the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, the biggest in parliament, rejected it.
But with the largest parties opposed to his coalition or unenthusiastic about its makeup, Fakhfakh may struggle to gain the strong parliamentary majority needed for any significant political program to tackle a severe economic crisis.
""I say it very clearly: if the government fails to win the confidence of parliament, the word will return to the people,"" Saied said.
Unemployment has been high and growth low since the 2011 revolution, while the government has sunk further into debt with a series of big budget deficits that foreign lenders demand it bring under control.
Ennahda's nominee for prime minister, Habib Jemli, proposed a coalition government that was rejected by parliament in a confidence vote last month.
""It is the worst political crisis in the country since independence,"" Saied said in a video broadcast.

Bozhkov, one of Bulgaria's richest men, has denied wrongdoing. He has refused to return to the Balkan country, saying he fears for his life.
Consecutive governments in the European Union's poorest member state have pledged to combat organized crime and uproot endemic graft, with little success.
The justice ministry said it had sent the extradition request and more than 200 pages of documents translated in Arabic to the Bulgarian embassy in the UAE to be handed to the authorities.
Prosecutors have said Bozhkov, 63, owner of several gambling companies, a popular soccer club and a foundation that holds a rich collection of Thracian antiques, was detained in the United Arab Emirates at the end of January.
On Sunday, Bulgarian National Television, citing unnamed sources, said he was released from custody but was banned from leaving the country and his passport was taken.
Bulgaria does not have an extradition agreement with the UAE, but hopes that its request will be respected.
""We want him returned to Bulgaria to be brought before the Bulgarian court,"" Bulgarian chief prosecutor Ivan Geshev said."

Spain claims sovereignty over the port at the mouth of the Mediterranean that it ceded to Britain in 1713 after a war. However, in a 2002 referendum 99% of Gibraltarians rejected any idea of Britain sharing sovereignty with Spain.
Britain formally left the European Union on Jan. 31 but remains bound by EU laws and regulations until the end of the year. Brexit has complicated relations between EU member Spain and Gibraltar, a British overseas territory.
""There are those who say that Spain must capitalize on the apparently historic opportunity she now has to recover sovereignty over Gibraltar after 300 years,"" Joseph Garcia told a conference in Brussels, referring to Brexit.
But Garcia said the center-left government of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez did not seem inclined to take that line.
""Sanchez has called himself for a different approach, one which puts a historic sovereignty question to one side and focuses on the opportunity we now have to create an area of shared prosperity on both sides of the border,"" Garcia told the conference at the European Policy Centre.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya has also echoed Sanchez's words, Garcia said, by stressing the importance of solving day-to-day issues for citizens.
""We will not agree on everything, but it is this pragmatism that creates the space in which we can talk.""
Gibraltar has a population of 32,000 and, at the end of December, around 14,400 workers were commuting there from Spain. It also welcomes some 10 million tourists per year, a sector accounting for about a quarter of its economy.
Garcia noted that the European Union had common travel areas agreed with the likes of Switzerland and Iceland.
""There is no need to reinvent the wheel,"" he said.
Garcia recalled that Spanish dictator Francisco Franco closed the land border with Gibraltar in 1969, even cutting telecom links. It only reopened to pedestrians in 1982 and cars in 1985.
""(It) had a devastating effect on everything around it. This cannot be allowed to happen again,"" Garcia said."

871,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 12:23PM ET</span>","Snubbed by Gulf, Lebanon's PM Diab hosts Iranian official","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab, who is getting the cold shoulder from Gulf Arab states, on Monday met Iran's parliament speaker, the first senior foreign official to visit since Diab's government took office.
Gulf states had long channeled funds to Beirut but have grown alarmed by the rising clout of Iran's ally Hezbollah. Lebanon's rich Gulf neighbors now appear loathe to help it out of an unprecedented economic and financial crisis.
The heavily armed Hezbollah backed Diab's cabinet after efforts failed to strike a deal with Saad al-Hariri, a traditional Western ally who stayed out of the new government. 
The economic crisis came to a head last year as slowing capital inflows led to a liquidity crunch and protests erupted against the ruling elite. Banks are curbing access to cash, the Lebanese pound has slumped and inflation has spiked. 
Foreign donors have said they will only help after Lebanon enacts reforms.
However, analysts say Hezbollah's role in forming the government, which took office last month, could impede securing Western and Gulf aid. 
Iranian speaker Ali Larijani said in a news conference that Iran stood ready to help Lebanon. 
In response to a question on whether this would close the door to any Western aid, he said: ""We express our full readiness to support but we do not force this on anyone."" 
Mohanad Hage Ali, a fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, said his visit may not help bolster the new Lebanese government's image.
""It's not very helpful at this stage as Lebanon seeks foreign aid and a bailout and the help of Gulf Arab states. This is the not message you want to send,"" he said.
Diab has said his first trip abroad would be to the Arab region, particularly the Gulf monarchies. But none of them have officially commented on the government nor extended public invitations to Diab.
An Arab diplomat in the Gulf said only Qatar had invited Diab to visit so far. ""No other government in the Gulf will invite him,"" the diplomat said. 
Qatar did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it had sent an invitation. 
Lebanese President Michel Aoun's office said he received an invitation to Tehran during his meeting with Larijani on Monday. 
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on Sunday that the cabinet was not ""Hezbollah's government"" and that opponents who described it that way were damaging Lebanon's ties to foreign states and making it harder to combat the crisis. 
A team of IMF experts will begin consultations with Lebanon's government in Beirut on Thursday, a source familiar with the matter said. The heavily indebted state formally requested the Fund's technical help last week.

On the parallel market - now the main source of hard currency - the price of U.S. dollars hovered around 2,400 Lebanese pounds on Monday, 60% beyond the official peg of 1,507.5 in place since 1997.

Cameroon's army has since 2017 been fighting English-speaking militias seeking to form a breakaway state called Ambazonia amid the cocoa farms and forests of west Cameroon. As fighting has intensified, so have abuses by both sides, witnesses and rights groups say.
The fighting is the gravest threat to stability in the oil- and cocoa-producing country since President Paul Biya took power nearly 40 years ago.
It was not yet clear who was responsible for Friday's attack in Ntumbo in the northwest region of Cameroon near the Nigerian border. In a statement, separatists blamed the army. In its own the statement, the army denied wrongdoing.
Survivors ""were extremely shocked and traumatized. People just left their houses and left everything behind,"" said James Nunan, an official with the U.N. humanitarian coordination agency OCHA that conducted interviews with witnesses and survivors.
Nunan said that 14 of the dead were children, some of whom were under five. At least 600 people fled, he said.
The type of attack, with people being burned alive and shot, echoes other raids that witnesses told Reuters were committed by the military. The army has denied involvement in those raids.
The government said on Monday that its soldiers were on a reconnaissance mission in Ntumbo when they were attacked. The fighting that followed caused several fuel containers to explode and set nearby houses ablaze, it said, killing five civilians.
""In light of the methodically and professionally cross-checked information, it is simply an accident, collateral damage of the operations to restore security in the region,"" the government said in a statement.
The separatists said at least 35 civilians were killed in what they called a ""violation of the human rights of the Ambazonian people.""
Conflict between Cameroon's army and English-speaking militias began after the government cracked down violently on peaceful protesters by lawyers and teachers in 2016 complaining of being marginalized by the French-speaking majority.
Violence spiked again in the run-up to parliamentary elections on Feb. 9, rights groups said, including the burning of houses.
Nearly 8,000 Cameroon refugees fled to eastern and southern Nigeria in the first two weeks of February, the United Nations refugee agency said, adding to the more than half a million people who have already left."

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A high-profile local Taliban figure who announced and justified the 2012 attack on teenage Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai has escaped detention, Pakistan's interior minister confirmed a few days after the militant announced his breakout on social media.
Former Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan, who claimed responsibility on behalf of his group for scores of Taliban attacks, proclaimed his escape on Twitter and then in an audio message sent to Pakistani media earlier this month.
The Pakistani military, which had kept Ehsan in detention for three years, has declined to comment but, asked by reporters about the report, Interior Minister Ijaz Shah, said: ""That is correct, that is correct.""
Shah, a retired brigadier general, added that ""you will hear good news"" in response to questions about whether there had been progress in hunting down Ehsan.
Ehsan later told a Reuters reporter by telephone that he had already left Pakistan and arrived in Turkey together with his wife and children. He said he had surrendered to the army under a deal, and escaped only after the agreement was not honored.
He said he escaped on Jan. 11 but did not clarify how he had broken out of a maximum-security military prison and made his way to another country.
Pakistani analysts and experts on militant Islam have voiced doubt about Ehsan's claim to have escaped. They have speculated that he may have been converted into an asset by the state and that reports he was on the run could be a ruse to plant him back in the Islamist militant scene for use as an informant.
After Ehsan's surrender in 2017, local Geo News TV aired an interview he gave in custody in which he asserted that the intelligence services of Pakistan's arch-rival, India, had been funding and arming Pakistani Taliban fighters.
The Pakistan army pledged to put Ehsan on trial but has not done so.
Taliban attacks in Pakistan have declined in recent months since the army carried out several operations against sanctuaries used by the Islamist militant groups in lawless districts along the border with Afghanistan."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will launch a new naval and air mission in the eastern Mediterranean to stop more arms reach warring factions in Libya, foreign ministers agreed on Monday, after Austria lifted its veto.
The decision marked a breakthrough after weeks of fruitless negotiations and warnings by EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell that the bloc risked becoming irrelevant if it could not act, potentially leaving Libya's fate to Turkey and Russia.
""We all agree to create a mission that blocks the flow of arms into Libya,"" Italian Foreign Minister Luigi di Maio told reporters following a meeting in Brussels, referring to a U.N. arms embargo first imposed in 2011 but now barely upheld.
In a compromise to assuage Austria's concerns that any naval mission could bring more migrants to Europe, EU ships will hail and inspect suspicious vessels in the eastern Mediterranean, where most arms smuggling takes place, away from migrant routes, diplomats said.
Austria's Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said that was acceptable but that Vienna would still be vigilant for any signs that the mission, which will take several weeks to set up, was attracting migrants into Europe.
Initially Borrell had hoped to revive the EU's current military mission, known as Operation Sophia, which stopped deploying ships last March after Italy, facing an anti-immigrant backlash, said it would no longer take migrants rescued at sea.
One compromise was to use aircraft, rather than ships, to monitor smugglers who supply Libya's two rival governments.
But German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas urged the EU to agree on a naval mission, saying overflights would not be enough. On Sunday, a senior U.N. official warned that the arms embargo was meaningless because there is no one to enforce it.
In a mainly symbolic move, Operation Sophia will now be scrapped. Austria's Schallenberg said he agreed because the new mission was purely military, not humanitarian. However, under international law, EU ships are still required to rescue those in trouble on the high seas.
Borrell said earlier on Monday he did not expect a deal, because Vienna was still blocking. He publicly said on Sunday it was unacceptable that Austria, a country with no navy, could hold up an EU sea mission.
Borrell needed the backing of all 27 governments to proceed.
Following a summit of world leaders last month in Berlin that aimed to seek a ceasefire in Libya, the EU will also consider a peacekeeping mission if a fragile truce becomes a ceasefire, diplomats said."

LONDON (Reuters) - A British lawmaker, who chairs an all-party group on Kashmir, has been denied entry to India after she criticized the government's decision to strip the disputed Himalayan region of its constitutional autonomy.
Debbie Abrahams, a member of parliament for the opposition Labour party, landed at New Delhi's international airport on Monday but claims she was unable to clear customs after her Indian visa was rejected.
Abrahams said she had no plans to visit Kashmir during what she called a ""private visit"" to India to see relatives, although she had been planning to journey on to the Pakistani capital Islamabad to discuss the issue.
She has been critical of the Indian government for revoking Kashmir's special status last August, which allowed the region to make its own laws, in an attempt to integrate the country's only Muslim-majority region more fully.
Abrahams said she was ""treated like a criminal"" and told to leave India before being marched on to a plane bound for Dubai.
""The immigration officer looked at his screen and started shaking his head and saying 'no, no, no',"" she told Sky News.
""Then he said the visa had been rejected, took my passport, went off to consult with others, kept us waiting for about ten minutes and then said: 'No, you are being denied entry'.""
There was no immediate comment from the Indian government.
Kashmir is claimed by India and arch-rival Pakistan and has been in turmoil since New Delhi removed its autonomy and enforced the changes by deploying thousands of additional troops and imposing a communication blackout.
India has since restored limited internet connectivity, ending one of the world’s longest such shutdowns in a democracy.
But many political leaders, including three former chief ministers of Jammu & Kashmir state, are still in detention without charge six months after the crackdown, and foreign journalists have been denied permission to visit the region.
Shortly after the changes to Kashmir's status were passed by India's parliament, Abrahams wrote a letter to India's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, saying the action ""betrays the trust of the people"" of Kashmir."

Citing mobile phone metadata and a months-long investigation conducted with Der Spiegel and The Insider, Bellingcat published information it said showed the assassin was trained and supplied with false identity papers by the FSB, the successor agency to the Soviet-era KGB.
The FSB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia has denied involvement in the killing.
The Russian-Georgian victim, known as Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, was a former Chechen rebel who had fought against Russian forces. He was shot dead on Aug. 23 in a Berlin park.
Surveillance footage showed his killer cycled up to him but that Khangoshvili had managed to push him over. He then tried to flee, but his killer pursued him and shot him at least twice, German prosecutors have said.
His suspected killer, a man traveling on a Russian passport, is in German custody.
Germany expelled two Russian diplomats in December over what it said was Moscow’s refusal to cooperate in the investigation. Russia responded by expelling two German diplomats.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said in December that Khangoshvili was himself a killer who took part in bloody acts on Russian soil.
Putin called Khangoshvili ""a cruel and blood-thirsty person,"" saying the murdered man had fought on the side of anti-Moscow separatists in Russia’s mainly Muslim north Caucasus region.
Tensions between Russia and Western countries including Germany, which is heavily reliant on Russian gas and oil, are already high after the 2018 poisoning of a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter on British soil."

The advances were made after President Bashar al-Assad's forces drove insurgents from the M5 highway linking Aleppo to Damascus, reopening the fastest route between Syria's two biggest cities for the first time in years in a big strategic gain for Assad.
Backed by heavy Russian air strikes, the government forces have been fighting since the start of the year to recapture the Aleppo countryside and parts of neighboring Idlib province where anti-Assad insurgents hold their last strongholds.
Government air strikes on Monday hit Darat Izza, near the Turkish border about 30 km (20 miles) north of Aleppo city, wounding several civilians and forcing two hospitals to close, according to hospital staff. 
Witnesses also reported air strikes in southern areas of Idlib province.
The advances have sent hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians fleeing toward the border with Turkey in the biggest single displacement of the nine-year-old war.
It has also upset the fragile cooperation between Ankara and Moscow, which back opposing factions in the conflict.
Turkey and Russia began a new round of talks in Moscow on Monday after several demands by Ankara that Assad's forces should back down and a ceasefire be put in place.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that militant attacks on Russian bases and Syrian positions have continued and ""it is not possible to leave this unanswered"".
""Troops from Russia and Turkey on the ground in Syria, in Idlib, are in constant contact with each other, looking at changes in the conditions. They have a full understanding of each other,"" said Lavrov. 
However, the Syrian armed forces said in a statement they would push on with what they called their ""sacred and noble task to rid what remains of terrorist organizations wherever on Syria's geography they are found"".
They had taken full control of dozens of towns in Aleppo's northwestern countryside, they said.
Syrian transport minister Ali Hammoud announced on Monday the re-opening of Aleppo's international airport with the first flight, from Damascus to Aleppo, scheduled for Wednesday and flights to Cairo to be announced within days, state news agency SANA reported.
Pro-Damascus Al-Watan newspaper said the M5 highway, a vital artery in northern Syria, would be ready for civilian use by the end of the week. Aleppo city, once Syria's economic hub, was the scene of some of the most vicious fighting of the war between 2012 and 2016.
The Syrian army had also opened the international roadway from northern Aleppo to the towns of Zahraa and Nubl toward the Turkish border, a military news service run by Lebanon's Assad-allied pro-Damascus Hezbollah group said.
The insurgent forces arrayed against Assad include Western-backed rebels and jihadist militants.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said his military will drive back Syrian forces if they do not withdraw from Idlib by the end of the month. On Saturday, he appeared to move that date forward, saying Turkey would ""handle it"" before the end of the month if there was no pull-back.
Alarmed by the new refugee crisis on its border, Turkey has sent thousands of troops and hundreds of convoys of military equipment to reinforce its observation posts in Idlib, established under a 2018 de-escalation agreement with Russia.

KIGALI (Reuters) - A popular singer in Rwanda, who was jailed on charges of plotting to kill the country's president but later pardoned, was found dead in a police cell on Monday in what authorities said was suicide.
A survivor of Rwanda's 1994 genocide, Kizito Mihigo was well-known for singing the national anthem at official ceremonies, including some attended by President Paul Kagame.
""We are very disheartened. I ask the government to promote love,"" a family member who asked not to be named told Reuters.
In 2015, Mihigo was sentenced to 10 years in prison after he was found guilty of conspiring to assassinate Kagame and other senior government officials. Kagame pardoned him three years later.
Mihigo was re-arrested three days ago over what police said was a violation of the terms of his release by trying to leave the country without permission and attempting to bribe Rwandans who spotted him trying to cross into Burundi.
Marie Michelle Umuhoza, spokeswoman for the Rwanda Investigation Bureau, said Mihigo had been alone in the cell.

CAIRO/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Libya's combatants are readying for a long conflict, as foreign weapons flood in, tribesmen close oil ports and rival alliances wrangle over revenues from Africa's largest petroleum reserves.
The moves signal deepening animosity in a war that could worsen regional instability and swell the flow of migrants from the Middle East and Africa almost a decade after Muammar Gaddafi's fall in 2011.
From his large villa in Libya's east, tribal leader Sanoussi al-Zwai sees plenty more trouble ahead for the huge country, for years contested by two rival authorities in the east and west.
He is an ally of Commander Khalifa Haftar, whose self-styled Libya National Army (LNA) also has the support of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jordan and Russian mercenaries as it tries to capture the capital Tripoli.
Zwai's tribe is blocking oil ports, resisting calls by the United States and the United Nations to restart flows of Libya's vital income source, which is run by Haftar's foe, the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA).
Zwai's price for unlocking the ports is for the GNA, based 1,000 km (620 miles) away in Tripoli, to funnel more income to his people. If the GNA resists, he suggests there could be worse to come.
""We are not happy with what is happening now, but we have ways to escalate if the international community does not listen to us,"" said Zwai, leader of a tribe living near eastern oil facilities.
""There will be a major escalation. We have other things (means) to use at the time. If it comes to it, the world knows what escalation is,"" he told Reuters in the main eastern city of Benghazi, without saying what any escalation would involve.
RACING TO REARM
The standoff over oil is only one of several factors that could prolong the almost year-long conflict over the capital, where the GNA last month secured military backing from Turkey including Turkish-backed fighters from Syria.
The combatants are racing to rearm, receiving shipments both before and after foreign backers agreed to enforce a truce at a summit in Germany in January. The inflow of advanced artillery and fighters and advisers breaches pledges made in Berlin to respect an arms embargo, diplomats say.
On Thursday, the U.N. Security Council called for a ceasefire but Russia, a Haftar backer, abstained from the vote. Diplomats took this as sign that Moscow might not be committed to a U.N.-led political mediation.
Haftar's forces and their foreign backers have stopped fighter jet strikes on the capital. But Western diplomats and experts say this is not due to a genuine desire for peace but because of better air defenses supplied by Turkey.
Until Turkey's intervention, Tripoli officials had started to panic they might lose the capital, the diplomats said.
Instead, Syrian fighters sent by Turkey have helped reverse small LNA gains, restoring frontlines to roughly where they settled just after the LNA attack began in April 2019.
Estimates from diplomats in Turkey about the number of Syrian fighters vary from 1,500 to 3,000, while the number of Turkish troops was seen at between 200 to 500 including special forces, conventional troops and drone operators.
""Both sides are preparing for the next battle,"" said a Western diplomat.
Diplomacy repeatedly founders on mutual suspicions.
""Each time we have any kind of agreement ... we always saw the same pattern,"" said Taher el-Sonni, the GNA ambassador to the U.N. ""It's more like gaining time, then (Haftar decides to) just use force.""
Turkey has sent heavy trucks by sea, while the UAE flew in 89 shipments totaling 4,680 metric tons between Jan 12 and Feb 16, according flight tracking data and a security source. The UAE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
CONTROL OF OIL WEALTH
Newly-shipped big guns are already making their presence felt, as shelling from long-range artillery blamed on the LNA hit the city center for the first time this week.
Away from the Tripoli battle, which has displaced at least 150,000 people, the conflict has shifted to the control of oil wealth. Forces allied to Haftar have kept the ports shut for a month, causing losses of some $1.4 billion.
The blockade echoes complaints of neglect going back to Gaddafi, who punished the east for dissent in his long rule.
Pressure from international powers and the United Nations has so far failed to persuade Haftar to reopen the ports and the southern El Sharara oilfield, Libya's largest. The veteran commander has even won some new recognition from Western countries that oil revenues need to be distributed fairly.
A senior U.S. diplomat said it was important that oil revenues are distributed equally, something he said should be discussed in U.N.-led intra-Libyan economic talks, part of a mediation to overcome divisions.
Neither side discloses how much it spends on the conflict.
Diplomats say the Tripoli government is less dependent on oil than before, as up to a third of the budget is covered by a fee it levies on all private transactions involving hard currency. Some of the Syrian fighters sent by Turkey are paid directly by Tripoli, diplomats say.
A stalemate looms. On Friday Haftar dashed hopes of a truce, saying there would be no peace until ""militias"" holding Tripoli had been defeated. For its part, Tripoli demands the LNA pull back 1,000 km (620 miles) east, something Haftar rejects.
""We don't expect to reach a ceasefire unless these troops (LNA) go back where they came from,"" said GNA Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha."

It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack, which comes as jihadist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State seek to gain control over once peaceful rural Burkina Faso, fuelling ethnic and religious conflict.
Hundreds have died over the past year, and over half a million people have fled their homes. 
The timing of the shooting, during a church service in the village of Pansi in the Yagha region, mirrors that of other attacks on Christians in the past year, including church attacks and assassinations of pastors and priests.
The violence threatens to upend traditionally peaceful relations between Burkina Faso's majority Muslim community and its Christians, who represent up to a quarter of the population.
Armed assailants ""attacked the peaceful residents of this area after identifying them and separating them from non-residents,"" the government said in a statement on Monday.
It said 18 people were also injured in the attack and an unknown number were kidnapped. It added that a pastor was killed but did not specify that the attack occurred in a church during mass. 
Many Muslims have also been killed by armed groups over the past year. Last October, gunmen stormed a mosque during Friday prayers and killed 15 people.
Attacks by jihadists groups have surged in the past year in Burkina Faso and across the broader Sahel region, an arid expanse of scrubland just south of the Sahara desert.
They have worked to sow ethnic tensions between farming and herding communities in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger in order to boost recruitment among marginalized communities.
The number of people displaced by the conflict increased tenfold in 2019 to more than 560,000 people, making it the world's fastest-growing displacement crisis, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council.

German authorities declined to comment on the case.
""Mr. Ahmad Khalili, an Iranian citizen, who was arrested in Germany at the request of the (U.S. Justice Department) and subject to extradition to America under the excuse of violating the illegal and cruel sanctions of America was freed last night and returned to the homeland with the minister of foreign affairs,"" said Mousavi, according to state TV.
The spokesman did not say how Khalili might have violated U.S. sanctions but said he had been freed through ""intense diplomatic consultations and with the effective cooperation of the (Iranian) judiciary and the intelligence department of the Revolutionary Guards"".
Mousavi did not elaborate on how Iran's judiciary or the intelligence wing of the elite Guards, the most powerful military force in Iran, had contributed to the decision to free Khalili.
Tensions between Iran and the United States have escalated since the Islamic Republic's most prominent military commander, Qassem Soleimani, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3. Iran retaliated with a missile barrage against a U.S. base in Iraq days later.
U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six powers in 2018 and Washington reimposed sanctions which have battered the Islamic Republic's economy.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Putting more masterpieces in Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel to join his ceiling frescoes and Last Judgement wall might seem as superfluous as adding more diamonds to the Crown Jewels.
But the creator of those masterpieces is Raphael, Michelangelo's Renaissance contemporary and rival, so the Vatican has made an exception for a brief stay.
For the first time in centuries, all 12 tapestries designed by Raphael have been hung on the lower walls of the Sistine Chapel as part of celebrations marking the 500th anniversary of the artist's death.
""They were conceived for this space and so we thought it was the best way to celebrate,"" Barbara Jatta, director of the Vatican Museums, told Reuters.
The tapestries, which were weaved in Brussels by the famed studio of Pieter van Aelst from Raphael's sketches, depict scenes from the Acts of the Apostles, such as The Stoning of St. Stephen and St. Paul Preaching in Athens.
For the next week, they are back in the Sistine Chapel, where they were between the time Michelangelo finished painting the ceiling in 1512 and when he began painting the massive Last Judgement wall behind the main altar in 1536.
All 12, made with silk, wool and gold and silver thread, have been painstakingly restored by Vatican Museum conservationists in the last 10 years.
""UNIVERSAL IMPORTANCE""
""This place is of universal importance, not only for visual arts but for our faith,"" Jatta said, standing in the Sistine Chapel. ""So we really want to share this beauty with people, even if only for one week"".
Seven of the tapestries, commissioned by Pope Leo X, were hung in the chapel on St. Stephen's day, Dec. 26, 1519. Raphael was probably there to see them but he died four months later at the age of 37. The others were finished after his death.
""The last record that we have of all of them being hung in the Sistine is from the late 1500s,"" Alessandra Rodolfo, the curator of the exhibition, told Reuters.
Previous exhibitions, some of which lasted only a few hours or a day, included only the 10 larger tapestries, some measuring about six by five meters. Two of the twelve are narrow and hung vertically as borders.
A selection are normally on display on rotation behind glass in climate-controlled spaces in the Vatican Museums.
The Vatican Museums' conservationists and restorers allowed all 12 of the delicate tapestries to be put on show at the same time for only a week, in part to protect them and in part because some will be on loan to other museums.
One will be going soon to Rome's Quirinale Palace's Scuderie museums and another will be going to the National Gallery in London later this year.
""It's exactly what Pope Francis is asking us, which is to share and to be a museum open to everybody and to share our beauty,"" Jatta said."

Sergeant Major Jakrapanth Thomma killed 29 people and wounded 57 during a 19-hour rampage last week after he shot his commanding officer and relative in a business dispute. The 32-year-old soldier was then shot dead.
The incident cast a spotlight on the questionable involvement of soldiers in the army's commercial activities, in a country that has just emerged from direct military rule.
Army Chief General Apirat Kongsompong has vowed a major cleanup of the army's business activities, which generate an annual income of nearly one billion baht ($32 million). They include golf courses, boxing arenas, horse racecourses, sports clubs, hotels and petrol stations.
""From now on the army will hand over various projects to the Treasury Department to consider how to proceed, based on its laws and regulations,"" said General Teerawat Boonyawat, Chief of Staff of the army.
The transfer means the businesses' revenues will go directly to the state. Some of the earnings will go towards the welfare of army personnel.
""I cannot yet say how much profit the army businesses generate because we have to work on it,"" said Prasong Poontaneat, Permanent Secretary of the Finance Ministry.
""We will bring on board professionals to make these businesses beneficial to soldiers' welfare and improve transparency,"" he said."

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Equatorial Guinea argued on Monday that a luxury mansion in central Paris used by the son of the country's president was protected by diplomatic immunity when it was raided by French authorities in 2012.
The case at the International Court of Justice is seen as a test for the limits of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Immunity, which shields government officials from prosecution abroad.
Equatorial Guinea launched the case in 2016 after the residence of Teodorin Obiang on the grand Avenue Foch was raided as part of a corruption investigation that resulted in a conviction for embezzlement, confirmed last week.
The conviction came after a collection of 25 supercars he owned, including a Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) Enzo and a Bugatti Veyron, were confiscated by the Geneva prosecutor's office under a deal ending a money-laundering inquiry. The cars fetched nearly 27 million Swiss francs ($27 million) at auction in September.
Obiang, 50, is the son of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who has ruled Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony, for more than three decades.
A representative for Equatorial Guinea told the court's judges on Monday that the luxury apartment, in one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the world, had been bought by the African nation in 2011 and was part of its embassy.
""France has refused to recognize the diplomatic pretext of the building under the false pretence it belongs to the private domain"", ambassador Carmelo Nvono Nca, Equatorial Guinea's agent, told the judges.
In coming days France will present its side before the United Nation's highest court for disputes between states. A ruling is expected later this year.
In earlier hearings the French argued Equatorial Guinea was attempting to shield Obiang, known for posting pictures of his glamorous lifestyle on Instagram, by retroactively adding his opulent 101-room home to its diplomatic mission.
Police raided Obiang’s residence as part of a corruption investigation, eventually seizing 100 million euros worth of assets including paintings by Renoir and Degas and another fleet of luxury vehicles.
Obiang was convicted last week by a French court of embezzlement of public funds and ordered to pay a 30 million euro ($33 million) fine."

Patrick Zaki, a graduate student at the University of Bologna, was arrested on Feb. 7 when he arrived at Cairo airport on a visit to see his family, according a statement the following day from the Cairo-based Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) where he is also a researcher.
Zaki is being investigated over charges of ""broadcasting false news aimed at disrupting security and social peace and for using the internet to disrupt public order and endanger society,"" the prosecutor's statement said.
An EIPR lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that Zaki denied all charges and that his client had mostly been questioned about his human rights work when he was living in Egypt.
The lawyer, who said he spoke to Zaki after his arrest, said the postgraduate student told him he had been interrogated while blindfolded and had been beaten and subjected to electric shocks.
The prosecutor's statement said there ""were no visible signs of injuries"" on Zaki while he was being questioned, and that Zaki himself denied the existence of any injuries.
An interior ministry spokesman could not be reached for further comment.
Authorities say curbing fictitious news is necessary for national security. They regularly accuse researchers and news outlets of a lack of professionalism in covering Egypt and urge reporters to use only official outlets as sources.
Rights activists say that President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who came to power after leading the overthrow of Islamist former President Mohamed Mursi, has presided over the worst crackdown on freedoms in Egypt’s modern history.
Thousands of activists, most of them Islamists but also including dozens of liberals and leftists, have been jailed in Egypt under regulations imposed since 2013.
Sisi and his backers say such measures are needed to keep Egypt stable and to counter threats from Islamist militants.
Local and international human rights groups and the European Parliament have condemned Zaki's arrest and called for his immediate release.
""I want to remind the Egyptian authorities that EU relations with third countries rely on respect for human rights and civil rights as confirmed by many resolutions approved by the European Parliament,"" the president of European Parliament, David Sassoli, told a news conference on Wednesday."

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, India (Reuters) - When artist Rachita Taneja heads out to protest in New Delhi, she covers her face with a pollution mask, a hoodie or a scarf to reduce the risk of being identified by police facial recognition software.
Police in the Indian capital and the northern state of Uttar Pradesh - both hotbeds of dissent - have used the technology during protests that have raged since mid-December against a new citizenship law that critics say marginalises Muslims. 
Activists are worried about insufficient regulation around the new technology, amid what they say is a crackdown on dissent under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Hindu nationalist agenda has gathered pace since his re-election in May. 
""I do not know what they are going to do with my data,"" said Taneja, 28, who created a popular online cartoon about cheap ways for protesters to hide their faces. ""We need to protect ourselves, given how this government cracks down.""
Critics also accuse authorities of secrecy - highlighting, for instance, that the software's use during Delhi protests was first revealed by the Indian Express newspaper. 
India's home ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on facial recognition technology. 
Modi's government has rejected accusations of abuse during demonstrations, and accused some protesters of stoking violence.
A spokesman for his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party had no immediate comment on concerns over the use of the technology and referred questions to the government. 
But police said worries about facial recognition were unwarranted. 
""I'm only catching targeted people,"" said Rajan Bhagat, a deputy commissioner of police at Delhi's Crime Records Office. ""We don't have any protesters' data, nor do we plan to store it.""
He declined to give details of potential arrests, however.
When it comes to surveillance, India trails far behind neighboring China. New Delhi, for example, has about 0.9 CCTV cameras for every 100 people, versus about 11.3 per 100 in China's commercial hub of Shanghai, a 2019 report by PreciseSecurity.com showed. 
The Delhi police use Indian startup Innefu Labs' facial recognition software AI Vision, which also includes gait and body analysis. 
""If somebody is throwing stones at a police officer, doesn't he have a right to take a video and identify him?"" said Innefu co-founder Tarun Wig, 36. 
Police in about 10 Indian states use Innefu products, Wig said.
Financial fraud analytics are among the services provided by Innefu, which published a social media analysis in January that concluded much criticism of the new citizenship law came from archenemy Pakistan to ""destabilize the harmony"" of India.
The company is representative of homegrown artificial intelligence startups tapping into booming demand for facial biometrics in India, in part thanks to their testing on Indian faces and more affordable prices. 
A few established foreign firms, such as Japanese telecommunications and IT giant NEC Corp, also operate in India, where the market is expected to grow from about $700 million in 2018 to more than $4 billion by 2024, TechSci Research said in a report.
UTTAR PRADESH ARRESTS
Facial recognition helped police in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, detain a ""handful"" of the more than 1,100 people arrested for alleged links to violence during protests, said O P Singh, its police chief who retired last month. 
Singh gave no details but said the technology helped cut the numbers of wrongful arrests and highlighted the state's extensive database of more than 550,000 ""criminals"".
Rights groups have decried what they call excessive force in Uttar Pradesh, which has the largest number of representatives in parliament and is governed by hardline Hindu priest and Modi ally Yogi Adityanath.
The state says tough policies have restored order. 
Startup Staqu is supplying its product, the Police Artificial Intelligence System, to police in eight states, including Uttar Pradesh, says the firm's co-founder, Atul Rai.
Fears of mass surveillance in India were exaggerated, said Rai, 30, citing difficulties in collecting information because of India's large population of 1.3 billion. But there was a need for regulation to avoid potential problems, he added. 
Police should have clear rules on use of facial recognition technology and there should be disclosure of the software's audits and algorithms, the non-profit Internet Freedom Foundation says.
""What India is seeing is a kind of personal data Wild West,"" said its executive director Apar Gupta. 
PAN-INDIA FACIAL RECOGNITION 
Law enforcement across India could soon be using facial recognition technology. 
Modi's government is seeking bids to create a nationwide database, the National Automated Facial Recognition System, to help match images captured from CCTV cameras with existing databases, including those of passport and police authorities. 
A foreign firm is expected to win the contract, since the bid terms require firms' algorithms to be evaluated by the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology. Both Innefu and Staqu said they were not bidding. 
Japanese firm NEC's India subsidiary helped develop the Aadhaar biometrics identity system and supplies facial recognition technology to law enforcement in the diamond industry hub of Surat in western Gujarat state.
The software has not been used during protests, however, the city's police commissioner, R B Brahmbhatt, told Reuters. 
NEC spokesman Shinya Hashizume declined to comment on whether the company was bidding to build the nationwide database. 
The system will boost police efficiency, says the National Crime Records Bureau, which launched the tender that closes at the end of March.
But critics say it puts India on the path to China-style mass surveillance. 
Worried about being identified, a 21-year-old Muslim protester in New Delhi has adopted the pseudonym Moosa Ali and sometimes covers his face with handkerchiefs. 

""We don't know enough about these things, but we are trying to take some precautions,"" he said.

KABUL (Reuters) - Taliban fighters attacked Afghan government forces overnight, and militant commanders said on Monday insurgency operations would go-ahead until they receive fresh instructions based on a deal with the United States to reduce violence in the country.
Last week, a senior U.S. administration official said negotiations with Taliban representatives in Qatar had resulted in and agreement in principle for a week-long reduction of violence, but the seven-day period had not commenced. The official said the agreement covered all Afghan forces, and would be closely monitored.
“Our leadership hasn’t conveyed any message about a ceasefire to us,” a Taliban commander in Helmand, a southern province that has seen some of the fiercest fighting.
Commanders in Paktika and Nangarhar - two other provinces regarded as strongholds for the Taliban – also said they would continue their attacks as planned.
On Sunday night, Taliban fighters attacked Afghan government forces manning a checkpoint in the northern province of Kunduz. According to a statement by Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid, they killed 19 security personnel.
The Afghan defense ministry confirmed the attack in a statement but put the death toll at five. It also said retaliatory air strikes were conducted against the militants.
A Taliban spokesman also issued a statement on Monday saying a Afghan military helicopter had been shot down in Nimroz province, but an official there said the helicopter made an emergency landing and had not been attacked.
Despite the violence on the ground, a senior Taliban leader in Doha confirmed a deal with the United States is set to be signed by the end of February in a ""signing ceremony"" in Doha.
Leaders of the United Nations, European Union and Islamic nations and neighboring countries would be invited to the attend, Mawlavi Abdul Salam Hanafi, deputy chief of the Taliban's Doha office, was quoted as saying by Nunn Asia - a pro-Taliban website with strong links to the group's leadership.
“Soon after signing the peace accord, the United States will release 5,000 of our prisoners and we will free 1,000 of theirs,” Hanafi said.
Successful implementation of the deal would move the United States closer to a further drawdown of troop levels in Afghanistan, meeting an objective for U.S. President Donald Trump, who has vowed to stop the ""endless wars"" as he seeks re-election in November.
There remains a long way to go to a peace settlement and end to the nearly two-decade-old U.S. military presence that began shortly after the 9/11 attacks by al Qaeda. U.S. officials have been clear that the 13,000 U.S. troops will be cut to about 8,600 this year, with or without a withdrawal deal."

Accompanied by senior North Korean figures, Kim took two well-publicized rides on the snowy slopes of the sacred Paektu Mountain in October and December.
State media heralded the jaunts as important displays of strength in the face of international pressure and the photos of Kim astride a galloping white steed were seen around the world.
North Korea has a long history of buying pricey horses from Russia and customs data first reported by Seoul-based NK News suggests that North Korea may have bolstered its herd in October.
According to customs data reviewed by Reuters, Russia exported 12 horses worth a total of $75,509 to North Korea last year.
It was the biggest buy since 2015, when North Korea spent $192,204 on 61 horses from Russia. Altogether, North Korea has imported at least 138 horses between 2010 and 2019, at a cost of $584,302, according to the Russian data.
The imagery of Kim astride a white stallion was designed to instill confidence in North Koreans that they have a man of strength and destiny holding the reins of power, analysts said.
The horse purchases also came as North Korea is under strict international sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programers."

LAGOS (Reuters) - It is dark when Abisoye Adeniyi leaves home on the packed Lagos mainland, weaving through cars and minibuses. She reaches her bus stop as the sun rises.
The 23-year-old Nigerian lawyer used to hop on a motorbike – known locally as an okada – for a quick ride to the bus that carries her from the mainland, where most of Lagos's 20 million residents live, to work in the island business district. 
Since the bikes, along with motorized yellow rickshaws called kekes, became illegal in most of the city on Feb. 1, Adeniyi has added a 30-minute walk to her journey – stretching the commute to nearly two hours. 
""It has not been easy at all,"" she said. 
Lagos state Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu outlawed the loosely regulated motorbikes and rickshaws, citing safety and security concerns.
Gridlock in the megacity, whose traffic jams were already ubiquitous, has intensified to the point that riots with burning tyres broke out and #LagosIsWalking trended on Twitter showcasing residents with ruined shoes. 
Many, including works and housing minister Babatunde Fashola, backed Sanwo-Olu's decision.
""Recklessness, disorderliness and total disregard for the traffic rules reigned supreme among the okada and keke riders,"" said Fashola, a former Lagos governor, in a statement. 
Since the ban, Sanwo-Olu has launched 55 additional buses and inaugurated 14 public ferries, promising an expansion of both. The largest boat can carry 60 passengers. London's Thames Clippers, in comparison, carry 220. 
""The ferry is good,"" said realtor Harrison Nunu on one of the modern boats. ""We need the bike."" Faced with a long walk to his office after landing, he said okadas bridged the gap between other forms of transport.
He is among the hundreds of thousands of former motorcycle and rickshaw passengers who hope the ban will be reversed. 
Mohammed Zanna, coordinator of the Physically Challenged Empowerment Initiative, said disabled people are unhappy at being trapped without kekes, as they cannot compete with people ""fighting and rushing"" to board packed buses. 
Former drivers lament their lost income in a nation with 23% unemployment. Ride hailing firms Gokada and Max.ng, which before the ban raised millions of dollars in foreign funding, have urged the government to regulate, rather than ban them.
Commuters are hoping for better. 

""I feel very tired and exhausted,"" Adeniyi said. ""It has not only affected me, it has affected everybody.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India summoned the Turkish ambassador on Monday to lodge a diplomatic protest over President Tayyip Erdogan's remarks on the disputed region of Kashmir and warned it would have a bearing on bilateral ties.
During a visit to Pakistan last week, Erdogan said the situation in Indian Kashmir was worsening because of sweeping changes New Delhi introduced in the Muslim-majority territory and that Turkey stood in solidarity with the people of Kashmir.
India, which considers all of Kashmir an integral part of the country, told Turkish envoy Sakir Ozkan Torunlar that Erdogan's comments lacked any understanding of the history of the Kashmir dispute, the Indian foreign ministry said.
""This recent episode is but one more example of a pattern of Turkey interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. India finds that completely unacceptable,"" foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said.
He said that India had served a strong demarche, or formal diplomatic note.
India withdrew Kashmir's autonomy in August and brought it under federal rule as a way to integrate the territory fully into India and quell a 30-year revolt. Pakistan, which controls a part of Kashmir, slammed the measure, and other Muslim-majority countries such as Turkey and Malaysia joined in calls for India to reconsider its actions.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration has put curbs on palm oil imports from Malaysia in retaliation and officials have said it is planning to cut some imports from Turkey as well.
India blames Pakistan for stoking the revolt in the territory in which tens of thousands of people have been killed. It accused Turkey of trying to justify its arch foe's use of ""cross border terrorism.""
""These developments have strong implications for our bilateral relations,"" the foreign ministry spokesman said, referring to Erdogan's comments.
Pakistan denies direct involvement in the rebellion, but says it provides diplomatic and moral support to the Kashmiri people in their struggle for self determination.
Erdogan told Pakistan's parliament that the Kashmir problem cannot be solved through pressure but on the basis of justice and fairness."

Police caught two of the gang of three and recovered all of the toilet paper, worth about HK$1,700 (nearly $220). They were still hunting for a third thief. No other details were given.

Panic in Hong Kong over the coronavirus has emptied supermarket shelves, with people stockpiling toilet paper, cleaning products and basic foodstuffs.

896,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 04:19AM ET</span>",Two fathers demand action against Japan over parental child abduction,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Two European fathers who live in Japan will urge EU lawmakers this week to increase pressure on Tokyo to tackle parental child abduction by changing a law that does not recognize joint child custody following divorce.
Frenchman Vincent Fichot and Italian Tommaso Perina will present a petition to the bloc's legislative assembly in Brussels on Wednesday to demand action against cases of so-called parental child abduction affecting Europeans living in Japan.
The two men -- who both became estranged from their children after their Japanese wives took them without consent -- say Japan should be sanctioned for breaching its human rights obligation under the EU-Japan Strategic Partnership Agreement.
In contrast to most other countries, Japan does not recognize joint custody of children following divorce and children often lose contact with the non-custodial parent.
In what critics say is an even more egregious human rights violation, courts often grant custody to an ""abducting"" parent even before any legal separation, leaving the second parent with no recourse or help to see their children.
In order to initiate diplomatic actions, the French Senate on Feb. 5 unanimously adopted a non-binding resolution calling on Japan to respect its international commitments under the Hague Convention.
EU lawmaker Geoffroy Didier called on the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in a letter dated Jan. 23 to suspend the EU-Japan Strategic Partnership Agreement which is aimed at promoting shared values of ""democracy, rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms.""
The plight of left-behind parents last year also prompted French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Giuseppe Conte to raise their concerns with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, while Japanese and foreign left-behind parents have also collectively launched a complaint to the UN's human rights body.
Several countries including Italy and Germany have posted travel advisories for Japan, warning of the consequences of parental child abductions as Tokyo prepares to host the Olympic Games this year."

SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (Reuters) - An influx of Chinese that some Cambodians resented for bringing noise, dust and chaos to the port of Sihanoukville, is the cause of more pain now that it has gone into reverse.
The new coronavirus has meant yet another setback for Sihanoukville after the government last year banned the online gambling that had helped fuel the spectacular growth of a once listless city into a major Chinese population center.
""Now things are calm and in order, unlike before, but it is bad for businesses like mine,"" said tuk-tuk driver Kwan Samhay, 55, as he cruised the streets looking for passengers. ""There are no Chinese tourists riding on my tuk-tuk anymore.""
More than any city in Southeast Asia, Sihanoukville exemplified China's growing regional presence and the complexity of economic, political and personal ties that have sprung up.
Touted on the one hand as an important port and industrial center for China's Belt and Road Initiative, the biggest driving force for Chinese investment had been into casinos - and most of all into online gambling.
That stopped last year, when Cambodia banned the online casinos under pressure from Beijing - driving out tens of thousands of Chinese who had moved to the city. Before that an estimated 80,000 Chinese lived in Sihanoukville, roughly on a par with the Cambodian population.
Sihanoukville's remaining casinos had continued to draw a steady stream of Chinese customers and real estate developments had brought investors looking for an exotic opportunity.
But that has almost stopped now that travelers are unable to leave China because of restrictions over the coronavirus epidemic that has killed more than 1,700 people, mostly in China.
Sihanoukville has had its own virus scare - recording the only case in Cambodia, but also hosting the cruise ship MS Westerdam from which one passenger has tested positive for the virus.
""SO QUIET""
""Since the Chinese left and then the coronavirus outbreak started, the crowd in this city is very much different from before, it is now so quiet,"" said Kwan Samhay.
Across the city, where provincial authorities reported in mid-2019 that more than 90 percent of businesses were Chinese owned, Chinese characters are peeling from the windows of abandoned restaurants, supermarkets and hairdressers.
Casinos that relied entirely on online gambling are shuttered. Block after block of 12-storey buildings stand empty but for the desks where online casino workers used to contact customers across China.
Local authorities say at least 7,000 Cambodians have lost their jobs since the ban on online gambling last August.
For some in the Chinese business community, the ban on online gambling is a good thing and does not spell the end of the investment in the city, which also hosts a Chinese-run industrial zone and might have oil offshore.
""Offline casinos will continue to operate, but because of the flow of people, business is temporarily bad,"" said Zheng Longming, who has worked in Cambodia for more than 12 years.
""Sihanoukville cannot rely on online gambling to increase GDP or fiscal revenue... So I think this change is positive.""
The departure of so many people - nobody has a precise estimate - has reduced the strain on the city as authorities try to pave roads and fit sewer systems that had been overwhelmed by the new arrivals.
While work has stopped on many buildings and cranes spike idly from half built shells, elsewhere the construction continues.
For Kwan Samhay, the return of the Chinese cannot come soon enough. The grandfather who has been driving a tuk-tuk for more than 25 years used to get at least 10 customers a day, bringing in as much as $80. Now he scrapes by.
""I want the Chinese and other foreigners to come back so that it is good for my earnings,"" he said. ""If they do not come then we will face a crisis.""

899,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 02:16AM ET</span>",Scramble to track Cambodia cruise passengers after coronavirus case reported,"By Clare Baldwin
SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (Reuters) - Health authorities scrambled on Monday to track hundreds of passengers who disembarked from a cruise ship in Cambodia last week after a woman tested positive for coronavirus, heightening fears about the spread of the disease around the world. 
The new case raises questions about how companies and countries should handle monitoring and quarantine for people who may have been exposed to the new virus, since the American woman from the Westerdam cruise ship had passed the usually presumed incubation period of 14 days.
Holland America Line, which is owned by cruise giant Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp, said it is working with governments and health experts to track passengers.
""Guests who have already returned home will be contacted by their local health department and be provided further information,"" the company said in a statement.
Nearly 200 passengers from the Westerdam have returned to their home countries after traveling through Malaysia and Thailand, authorities said, though none of them displayed any symptoms. 
Some 1,455 passengers and 802 crew first embarked on the cruise. It spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand even though the ship said there were no coronavirus cases aboard.
In Cambodia, at least 236 passengers and 747 crew remain aboard the vessel off the port city of Sihanoukville, Holland America said.
Several hundred other Westerdam passengers who left the ship are still in hotels in Cambodia and are being tested on Monday for coronavirus, according to passenger Holley Rauen, a public health nurse and midwife from Fort Myers, Florida. 
“Everyone is very nervous about results,” Rauen said in a message to Reuters. “Some are grouchy but many still remain positive.""
ASYMPTOMATIC RISK
It was not immediately clear how the American woman contracted the virus, but the positive test in Malaysia came after she had spent more than 14 days on the Westerdam, which departed from Hong Kong on Feb. 1. 
Passengers had been cleared to travel by Cambodian authorities when the cruise ship docked on Thursday. The company said passengers were tested regularly on board and Cambodia also tested 20 people once it docked, but not the woman who contracted the virus. 
Raina MacIntyre, head of the Biosecurity Research Program at Australia's University of New South Wales, said it was well known the coronavirus can be infectious even if a patient has no symptoms.
""The Japanese tested over 500 of their first evacuees from Wuhan, whether they were symptomatic or not, and five out of eight positive tests were in asymptomatic people,"" MacIntyre said. ""So, in a high risk setting, it would be important to check for infection in everyone."" 
Holland America said it is working with health officials in Malaysia and Cambodia and experts in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Worries about the new virus have mounted even though it is believed to kill only around 1% of people it infects, because of fears that with no natural immunity among the world's population, it could spread to infect millions if unchecked.
The websites of both the CDC and WHO give an estimated incubation period for the virus of up to 14 days. 
Adam Kamradt-Scott, infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said a Chinese study of 1,099 patients indicated the incubation period could be as much as 24 days, but most people exhibited symptoms within three days.
Anyone potentially exposed to the virus should self-isolate and notify health authorities if they start to exhibit symptoms, he said.
""We need people to be willing to come forward and not fear persecution or discrimination, as that will only serve to aid the virus’ spread."" 

In Japan, another Carnival cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, has been quarantined since arriving in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, on Feb. 3. As of Sunday, 355 people aboard have tested positive - by far the biggest cluster of cases outside China.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Hardliners are set to tighten control of Iran this week in a parliamentary election stacked in their favor, as the leadership closes ranks in a deepening confrontation with Washington.
Big gains by security hawks would confirm the political demise of the country's pragmatist politicians, weakened by Washington's decision to quit a 2015 nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions in a move that stifled rapprochement with the West.
More hardliner seats in the Feb. 21 vote may also hand them another prize -- more leeway to campaign for the 2021 contest for president, a job with wide day-to-day control of government.
Such wide command of the power apparatus would open an era in which the elite Revolutionary Guards, already omnipresent in the life of the nation, hold ever greater sway in political, social and economic affairs.
Allies of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have ensured hardliners dominate the field, removing moderates and leading conservatives and permitting voters a choice mostly between hardline and low-key conservative candidates loyal to him.
""Literally, it is not a race anymore. Hardliners want the presidency. This is the end of moderation for at least a decade if not more,"" said an official on condition of anonymity.
Like hardliners, conservatives back the ruling theocracy, but unlike them support more engagement with the outside world.
Faced with little choice, many voters are likely to be focused on bread-and-butter issues, in an economy hurt by U.S. President Donald Trump's ""maximum pressure"" policy toward Iran.
With Iran facing growing isolation and threats of conflict over its nuclear standoff with the United States, and growing discontent at home, the turnout is seen as a referendum on the establishment -- a potential risk for the authorities.
REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS POWER
Many Iranians are furious over the handling of November protests against fuel price hikes which swiftly turned political with demonstrators calling for ""regime change"", leading to the bloodiest unrest in the history of the Islamic Republic.
A crackdown overseen by the Revolutionary Guards killed hundreds and led to the arrest of thousands, according to human rights organizations.
The public is also livid over the accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger plane in January that killed all 176 people on board, mainly Iranians. After days of denials, Tehran admitted that the Guards were to blame.
But Khamenei's loyalist candidates are backed by core supporters of the establishment who identify in all aspects of life with the Islamic Republic, insiders said.
""Their supporters believe in the establishment and they will vote because they see it as a religious duty. Hardliners will benefit from a low turnout,"" said the government official.
Speaking to Reuters, some authorities predicted a turnout of about 60% for the 290-seat assembly, compared to 62% and 66% respectively in the 2016 and 2012 votes. Some 58 million Iranians out of 83 million are eligible to vote.
""Iran is not only Tehran or other major cities where voters are politically motivated. In small cities, towns and generally in rural areas people will vote,"" a hardline official said.
With no independent, reliable opinion polls in Iran it is hard to gauge which way the ballot will go, let alone the extent to which Khamenei and the Guards will exert their influence over the vote to cement their grip on power.
But pro-reform voters are dismayed by disarray in their camp and the failure of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani to abide by an election pledge to ease social and political restrictions.
""Many Iranians (who voted for Rouhani) have lost their hope for reforms,"" said a reformist former official. ""They don't trust the reform movement anymore. They want change and only change.""
A hardline dominated parliament could mount pressure on Rouhani, architect of the nuclear pact, who has been criticized by Khamenei's influential allies for his performance in power.
""I beg you not to be passive ... I am asking you ... not to turn your back on ballot boxes,” Rouhani said in a speech on Feb. 11.
The slate of hardline candidates is dominated by the Guards, who answer directly to Khamenei, and their affiliated Basij militia, insiders and analysts say.
Aside from its vast economic holdings, the Guards have grown more politically assertive in recent decades, with increasing numbers of veterans in legislative and executive powers.
Former Guards commander Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, who according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable from 2008 has benefited from strong support from Khamenei’s son Mojtaba, tops the parliamentary lists of main hardline groups in Tehran.
BALANCE OF POWER
""We will serve wherever the revolution and our Imam (Khamenei) need us,"" said a former Guardsman, who served in the government of former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. His re-election in 2009 sparked protests for months against alleged vote-rigging.
Parliamentary elections have scant impact on Iran's foreign or nuclear policies, which are set by Khamenei, and major pro-reform parties have been either banned or dismantled since 2009.
But the vote shows shifts in the factional balance of power in Iran's unique dual system of clerical and republican rule.
Mass disqualifications of candidates in 2004 parliamentary polls sidelined reformists for years. It ushered in hardline Ahmadinejad in 2005.
In 2016 voters handed gains to centrists and moderates, suggesting many sought more open democracy and wider freedoms.
This time, the Guardian Council, a hardline vetting body, has disqualified 6,850 hopefuls out of 14,000, ranging from moderates to conservatives, from contesting parliament polls. About a third of sitting lawmakers have also been barred.
""We did what we were supposed to do, now it is your (voters) turn,"" said head of the Council Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati.
Several politicians including Rouhani strongly criticized the Council's rejection of over 50% of hopefuls. The watchdog denied any bias.
Khamenei, who has the final say in Iran's complex ruling system, has backed the watchdog, saying parliament has no place for ""those scared of speaking out against foreign enemies""."
901,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2020 10:03PM ET</span>",Battle of Iwo Jima 75 years on,"(Reuters) - This month marks the 75th anniversary of the start of the Battle of Iwo Jima, which saw some of the bloodiest fighting of World War Two take place on a small Japanese island 1,200 km (745 miles) south of Tokyo.
Iwo Jima was the first native Japanese soil to be invaded during the Allied advance. Located halfway between Tokyo and Guam, it was regarded as a strategic outpost. Close to 7,000 U.S. Marines and nearly all of the 21,000 Japanese defenders of the island died during the 36-day battle.
The Japanese troops held the heavily fortified island for more than a month, supported by a network of bunkers and tunnels and hidden artillery positions.
From Feb. 19, 1945, over 500 warships and 1,000 warplanes from the U.S. navy and army pounded Iwo Jima so heavily that the shelling and bombing changed the shape of the island's highest point, Mount Suribachi, located at its southern tip.
White phosphorus was used in the pre-invasion bombardment and U.S. troops wielded flame-throwers during the battle.
Mount Suribachi was captured on Feb. 23. A photograph of six U.S. marines raising a U.S. flag on the mountain, the second flag-raising that day, was taken by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal and won the Pulitzer Prize for Photography that year. It later formed the subject for the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia.
Iwo Jima reverted from U.S. to Japanese rule in 1968 and since then has housed about 400 Japanese navy and air force personnel who operate a landing strip. The runway is also used for night-landing practice by a Japan-based U.S. aircraft carrier.
Joint U.S.-Japan memorial services to mark the anniversary of the battle are held every year. In 1994, then Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko attended the service, the first time a Japanese emperor had visited the island.
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi became the first Japanese prime minister to attend the ceremonies in 2005."

Indigenous communities across Canada have been blocking some key railway lines for nearly two weeks in protest against the Coastal GasLink pipeline in British Columbia, which has forced Canada's biggest railroad, Canadian National Railway Co, to shut operations in eastern Canada.
Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller, who held talks with some indigenous communities on Saturday, told a talk show on Sunday the unrest and its impact on the economy amounted to a national crisis.
""Following the government's ongoing efforts to address infrastructure disruptions across the country, the Prime Minister will convene the Incident Response Group tomorrow to discuss steps forward,"" Trudeau's office said in a statement.
The C$6.6 billion ($4.97 billion) pipeline at the heart of the dispute would move natural gas from northeastern British Columbia to the Pacific Coast, where the liquefied natural gas Canada export facility led by Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc is under construction. The pipeline will be operated by TC Energy Corp.
In December, private equity firm KKR & Co Inc and Alberta Investment Management Corp agreed to buy a majority stake in Coastal GasLink.
The protests were sparked by the arrests of people opposing the pipeline's construction on traditional land of the Wet'suwet'en community. Some 28% of the 670-km (420-mile) route passes through Wet'suwet'en lands.
The most damaging protest is near Belleville in Ontario, the most-populous Canadian province. Canadian National has won court injunctions to end the action but the Ontario Provincial Police, responsible for enforcing the measures, has so far not acted.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corp reported on Saturday that at least 66 shipping vessels were stalled in British Columbia's waters because of rail blockades.
Trudeau was set to attend the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in Barbados this week. Instead, Canada will be represented by Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne, the statement added."

MANILA (Reuters) - Late each night, a dozen women chat and share a meal before hitting the narrow streets of a Manila suburb where a death squad once roamed.
They are the ""women's patrol"", a group of 18 mothers and grandmothers whose nightly walks through the dimly lit alleys of Pateros have been helping to deter shadowy gunmen behind murders of residents linked to illegal drugs.
Not long after Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte declared a war on drugs in 2016 and promised thousands would die, Pateros was being terrorized by attackers in hoods and ski masks, known locally as the ""bonnet gang"". (https://reut.rs/2H118PK)
With the town of 63,000 paralyzed by fear, the women decided to arm themselves with flashlights and patrol their community, keeping up a nightly presence to disrupt the bonnet gang. 
""When we started patrols, the enthusiasm came back to our community and the fear disappeared. Back then, people were afraid to go out,"" said Jenny Helo, 39, who leads the women through the labyrinth of shops, shacks and informal dwellings.
""But when they saw how effective we are, because of how we really go around the community, people regained confidence."" 
The killers have not been caught. 
In the deadliest periods of the crackdown, there were as many as four murders linked to drugs each day in the Philippines, many by gunmen riding pillion on motorcycles. 
The total number of drug-related killings since Duterte unleashed his drugs war is unknown.
Police say they killed 5,400 suspects in self-defense during their anti-drugs operations, but deny allegations by activists that elements of the force are involved in the mystery killings that plagued Pateros and other parts of Manila.
In a written response to Reuters, Duterte's spokesman Salvador Panelo called those ""inevitable results"" when a government was serious about suppressing illegal drugs.
He attributed the deaths to botched drug deals, turf wars between drug syndicates, or informants being silenced. 
Pateros is now safer and the gunmen have gone, say those who live there. The women never found out who the bonnet gang were, Helo said, but believe they thwarted them.
""We disrupted them in what they do,"" she said. ""They know we are here to fight what they're doing.""
Pateros police chief Colonel Simnar Gran praised the patrollers and said local police had worked closely with them and the mayor to tighten the town's security.
A few officers accompany the women each night, enforcing curfews and smoking bans, and warning people against drugs. 

""This can be replicated by other communities,"" Gran said. ""They're doing this voluntarily without compensation. They're just civic-minded people.""

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - For the past two weeks China's police have been raiding houses, restaurants and makeshift markets across the country, arresting nearly 700 people for breaking the temporary ban on catching, selling or eating wild animals.
The scale of the crackdown, which has netted almost 40,000 animals including squirrels, weasels and boars, suggests that China's taste for eating wildlife and using animal parts for medicinal purposes is not likely to disappear overnight, despite potential links to the new coronavirus.
Traders legally selling donkey, dog, deer, crocodile and other meat told Reuters they plan to get back to business as soon as the markets reopen.
""I'd like to sell once the ban is lifted,"" said Gong Jian, who runs a wildlife store online and operates shops in China’s autonomous Inner Mongolia region. ""People like buying wildlife. They buy for themselves to eat or give as presents because it is very presentable and gives you face.""
Gong said he was storing crocodile and deer meat in large freezers but would have to kill all the quails he had been breeding as supermarkets were no longer buying his eggs and they cannot be eaten after freezing.
Scientists suspect, but have not proven, that the new coronavirus passed to humans from bats via pangolins, a small ant-eating mammal whose scales are highly prized in traditional Chinese medicine.
Some of the earliest infections were found in people who had exposure to Wuhan's seafood market, where bats, snakes, civets and other wildlife were sold. China temporarily shut down all such markets in January, warning that eating wild animals posed a threat to public health and safety.
That may not be enough to change tastes or attitudes that are deeply rooted in the country's culture and history.
""In many people's eyes, animals are living for man, not sharing the earth with man,” said Wang Song, a retired researcher of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
ONLINE DEBATE
The outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,600 people in China, revived a debate in the country about the use of wildlife for food and medicine. It previously came to prominence in 2003 during the spread of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which scientists believe was passed to humans from bats, via civets.
Many academics, environmentalists and residents in China have joined international conservation groups in calling for a permanent ban on trade in wildlife and closure of the markets where wild animals are sold.
Online debate within China, likely swayed by younger people, has heavily favored a permanent ban.
""One bad habit is that we dare to eat anything,"" said one commenter called Sun on a news discussion forum on Chinese website Sina. ""We must stop eating wildlife and those who do should be sentenced to jail.""
Nevertheless, a minority of Chinese still like to eat wild animals in the belief it is healthy, providing the demand that sustains wildlife markets like that in Wuhan and a thriving online sales business, much of which is illegal.
One online commenter calling themselves Onlooker Pharaoh said on Chinese news platform Hupu that the risk was worth it: ""Giving up wildlife to eat as food is like giving up eating because you might choke.""
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT
The breeding and trading of wild animals in China is supported by the government and is a source of profit for many people.
After the SARS outbreak, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) strengthened oversight of the wildlife business, licensing the legal farming and sale of 54 wild animals including civets, turtles and crocodiles, and approved breeding of endangered species including bears, tigers and pangolins for environmental or conservation purposes.
These officially sanctioned wildlife farming operations produce about $20 billion in annual revenue, according to a 2016 government-backed report.
""The state forestry bureau has long been the main force supporting wildlife use,"" said Peter Li, a China Policy Specialist for the Humane Society International. ""It insists on China's right to use wildlife resources for development purposes.""
Much of the farming and sale of wildlife takes place in rural or poorer regions under the blessing of local authorities who see trading as a boost for the local economy. State-backed television programs regularly show people farming animals, including rats, for commercial sale and their own consumption.
However, activists pushing for a ban describe the licensed farms as a cover for illegal wildlife trafficking, where animals are specifically bred to be consumed as food or medicine rather than released into the wild.
""They just use this premise to do illegal trading,"" Zhou Jinfeng, head of China’s Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, told Reuters. ""There are no real pangolin farms in China, they just use the permits to do illegal things.""
The NFGA did not respond to requests for comment.
BLURRED LINES
Animal products, from bear bile to pangolin scales, are still used in some traditional Chinese medicine, an industry China wants to expand as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.
But the distinction between legal and illegal is blurred. The United Nations estimates the global illegal wildlife trade is worth about $23 billion a year. China is by far the largest market, environmental groups say.
The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), an independent organization based in London which campaigns against what it sees as environmental abuses, said in a report this week the coronavirus outbreak has in fact boosted some illegal wildlife trafficking as traders in China and Laos are selling rhinoceros horn medicines as a treatment to reduce fever.
China's top legislature will toughen laws on wildlife trafficking this year, the official Xinhua news agency reported this week.
""We are in a sun-setting business,"" said Xiang Chengchuan, a wholesale wildlife store owner in the landlocked eastern Anhui province. ""Few people eat dogs now, but it was popular 20 years ago.""
Xiang, who sells gift boxes of deer antlers and dog, donkey and peacock meat to wealthy bank clients and others, said he had frozen his meat as he waits to see if the ban will continue.
""I will resume selling once the policy allows us, but now I have no idea how long it (the ban) will last."""

The Arab town, from which Turkish-backed forces last October pushed out the YPG militia in a major campaign spearheaded by the Turkish army, has seen a series of car blasts that have killed dozens of civilians.
""The perpetrator was captured alive along with another terrorist who came to the area with a bomb-rigged vehicle for a second attack,"" the ministry said.
Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency said earlier, citing security sources, that four civilians were killed in the attack.
Turkey views the YPG as a terrorist organization linked to Kurdish insurgents on its own soil. The group was not immediately available for comment.
Syrian Arab rebels accused the YPG of carrying out the blasts, which they say seek to sow fear in areas where Turkey has carved a sphere of influence with the help of Syrian Arab rebels it backs and arms.
The Arab inhabitants of the area look at Ankara as their protector and accuse the Syrian Kurdish militia of forcibly pushing out the tribal population from these border area where they claim the YPG has sought to change its demography.
The U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish militia refutes those claims and says Turkey has expansionist designs. It also defends policies that adversaries say discriminate against Arabs as redressing historic grievances as persecuted Kurds.

The move, endorsed by 108 deputies in the 120-seat parliament, follows Zaev's resignation last month that came after the European Union failed to give his country a date to start talks on joining the bloc.
Zaev's cabinet was replaced by an interim government led by Interior Minister Oliver Spasovski which was tasked to ensure conditions for a free and fair vote.
""I have signed the decision (to set the date) for early elections on April 12,"" Talat Xhaferi, the parliamentary speaker, told deputies.
French President Emmanuel Macron in October refused to let North Macedonia start EU entry talks, despite concerns over increased Chinese and Russian meddling in the Balkans.
Skopje had expected to be granted a date to start accession talks after settling a dispute with neighboring Greece by changing the country's name to North Macedonia from Macedonia. Macron also led a group of EU leaders who ruled out opening talks with Albania.
Serbia and Montenegro also aspire to join the European Union but the enlargement process has also largely stalled amid concerns in the West about immigration and the strains of Brexit.
Bosnia and Kosovo, the other two EU hopefuls from the Balkans, are lagging far behind.
Earlier this month, EU's enlargement commissioner, Oliver Varhelyi, proposed giving EU members the power to delay or reverse the process of admitting new nations or to force them to restart entry talks in some policy areas.
North Macedonia is expected to become the 30th member of NATO early this year, once its accession has been ratified by all the member states of the U.S.-led alliance."

Abdiwali Ali Hassan, 25, was shot several times and died on his way to hospital, Captain Abdikadir Osman, Afgooye's police commander, told Reuters.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the killing in the district which is 25km (15 miles) outside the capital Mogadishu.

More than 7.4 million voters were due to vote to elect 3,849 positions in 158 municipalities across the Caribbean nation. The failure of the system is likely to raise concerns ahead of the May 17 presidential elections.
Julio Cesar Castanos, president of Dominican Republic's electoral body, said nearly half of the electronic devices did not work properly and many virtual ballot papers did not load, leaving citizens unable to cast their votes.
""We are going to initiate a thorough investigation of what happened and why those ballot papers did not load correctly,"" Castanos said in a press conference.
The electronic system was used in 18 of the 158 municipalities and focused on cities and regions with high population density, accounting for 62.4% of the electorate. Paper ballots were due to be used elsewhere.
Castanos said that the failures only occurred in the 18 municipalities that used electronic voting.
Eduardo Frei, president of the observer commission from the Organization of American States (OAS), recommended an exhaustive audit to determine the failure and called for a dialogue of all political sectors to find a solution and hold new elections.
Luis Abinader, leader of the opposition Modern Revolutionary Party, said the suspension of the vote was ""outrageous and unjustified"".
Several opposition parties, such as the People's Force, of former President Leonel Fernández, objected to the use of electronic voting due to fears software could be manipulated."

Khartoum said on Feb. 5 it had given Israeli planes initial approval to fly over its territory, two days after Sudan's military head of state, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, met Netanyahu in Uganda.
""Now we're discussing rapid normalization. The first Israeli airplane passed yesterday over the skies of Sudan,"" Netanyahu said in a speech to U.S. Jewish leaders, saying the route cut some three hours off flights from Israel to South America.
Sudan, mindful of pro-Palestinian sensitivities, has stopped short of saying it is normalizing ties with Israel.
Israel previously considered Sudan a security threat because it suspected Iran used Sudan as a conduit for overland smuggling of munitions to the Gaza Strip. In 2009, regional sources said, Israeli aircraft bombed an arms convoy in Sudan.
The corridor described by Netanyahu would also take planes over Egypt, which made peace with Israel in 1979, and Chad, which in 2018 restored long-severed relations with Israel.
Normalizing relations with Sudan, where Arab states gathered in 1967 to issue what became known as the “Three No’s” - no recognition of Israel, no peace with Israel and no negotiations with Israel - would allow Netanyahu to burnish his diplomatic credentials a month before Israel’s March 2 election.
Since their meeting, the air corridor is the most prominent development that has been discussed publicly by both sides.
Israeli commentators have speculated that the new contacts with Khartoum could allow for the repatriation of illegal Sudanese migrants in Israel, and that Israel could in turn lobby the United States to improve Sudan's standing in Washington."

JERUSALEM/THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Israel's prime minister on Sunday hailed what he called efforts by friendly states to stop the International Criminal Court opening an investigation into alleged war crimes against Palestinians.
The court's chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in December there was enough evidence for an investigation into thousands of killings - but asked the court to rule on whether it had the jurisdiction over the Palestinian territories.
Brazil, Hungary, Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic and Australia have asked the court over the past two weeks to let them file ""amicus brief"" opinions on the case, ICC records show.
Some, including Germany, said they would argue the court's jurisdiction did not extend to the Palestinian territories.
Brazil said it would argue that the Israeli-Palestinian crisis should be resolved through political dialogue, not a court ruling.
Netanyahu told his cabinet countries had responded to Israeli lobbying over the case.
""We are struggling against this (proceeding) and, at our side, I must say, are many friends around the world (which) joined the U.S. in a steadfast stand alongside Israel.""
The Palestinians were accepted as an ICC member in 2015 after they signed the court's founding Rome Statute, based on their United Nations ""observer state"" status.
Israel and the United States, neither of them ICC members, dispute the court's jurisdiction in the absence of a sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza or East Jerusalem.
The Organisation for Islamic Cooperation, representing 57 Muslim states, asked to file a brief, arguing that the Palestinians have sovereignty over the Palestinian territories.
The Palestinian Bar Association, the International Commission of Jurists and other legal and human rights organization have also asked to filed briefs with the court to say it does have jurisdiction in this case.
U.S.-sponsored Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking stalled in 2014. A new U.S. peace plan, unveiled by President Donald Trump last month, envisaged Israel keeping East Jerusalem and swathes of West Bank land, and was rejected by the Palestinians."

The authorities on Saturday found the cocaine in Costa Rica's Caribbean port of Limon, stashed inside a shipping container of decorative canopy plants bound for the Netherlands.
The anti-narcotics police discovered the drugs in 202 small bags and said the cocaine was produced in South America, though did not specify where.
The drugs had an estimated street value of about 126 million euro ($136 million) in Holland, Costa Rica's Security Minister Michael Soto said late on Saturday.

A former rebel leader, Agathon Rwasa, 56, fought in Burundi’s civil war, as did current President Pierre Nkurunziza, who will not seek re-election in the May poll. Like the president, he also comes from the northern Burundi province of Ngozi and the same ethnic group, the Hutu.
Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world and lost donor funding in 2015 after political violence that followed the elections. 
The tiny East African nation is struggling to come to terms with a violent past, characterized by colonial occupation, civil war and decades of intermittent massacres.
The population is divided between the Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups. Some 300,000 people were killed in the civil war which ended in 2005.
Rwasa denounced what he said were plans by the ruling party to rig the election. 
""As we are approaching elections, it's surprising to hear that there are people thinking about rigging elections... Burundians will not let them do it,"" he told delegates of his party after his appointment was announced.
In January the ruling party, the CNDD-FDD, chose as its candidate its secretary general, Evariste Ndayishimiye, a retired army general who also heads the department of military affairs in the president’s office and has served as minister of the interior and security. 
The government could not be reached for comment on the accusations of plans to rig the vote.
The United Nations has warned that human rights abuses might increase again ahead of the elections. Since 2015, when Nkurunziza ran for a third, disputed term in office, hundreds of Burundians have been killed in clashes with security forces.
The UN also denounced serious human rights violations, including killings, disappearances, torture and gang rape of alleged political opponents, perpetrated by the police, security forces and the ruling party’s youth league, the Imbonerakure.
The government condemned and denied the accusations."

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Around a hundred people called on Pakistan's government to ""bring back our children"" from the locked down Chinese province of Hubei in a demonstration on Sunday in Karachi.
Pakistan's government has so far ruled out evacuating the more than 1,000 Pakistani students in the province, home to the city of Wuhan, at the center of the coronavirus outbreak. 
State Health Minister Zafar Mirza said on Twitter on Friday that he and other ministers would hold a meeting for parents in Islamabad on Wednesday and that his government was working with Chinese authorities to ensure students were taken care of.
But many students and their families have expressed growing frustration as the death toll in China mounts, pointing to other countries, including neighboring India and Bangladesh, evacuating their citizens.
""For God's sake, we request from the government representatives please bring back our children, please listen to a mother's grievance,” one protester, who declined to give her name, told media while bursting into tears.
The protesters chanted ""bring back our children"" and held up banners with the same message.
Earlier in the week dozens of families in Lahore held a similar protest outside the Chinese consulate.
A spokesman for Mirza did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for further comment.
He said on Twitter six Pakistani students in China confirmed to have had the virus had fully recovered and one was still receiving treatment.
Nonetheless, students in touch with Reuters from China over the past days said they wanted to leave.
Mir Hassan, a student whose father died of a heart ailment this month while he was stuck in Wuhan, said he had been told by Pakistani officials he would not be evacuated despite wanting to return home to his grieving mother.
""She is also begging me to come back home. Unfortunately, I haven't any idea when I will go back home and see my mom,"" he told Reuters. 

Sahil Hassan, a PhD student in Wuhan, said he was finding it hard to receive scholarship payments, leaving them unable to afford food and bottled water from their university's food delivery service while in lock down.

Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah also said there was no point in politicians trading blame over the causes of the crisis, after former prime minister Saad al-Hariri on Friday accused his rivals of pushing the country to near-collapse.
Banks are curtailing access to deposits, the Lebanese pound has slumped, inflation has spiked and firms are shedding jobs and slashing wages in a financial crisis. Hariri resigned last year amid mass demonstrations against the ruling class.
Hezbollah, heavily armed and backed by Iran, is one of the main backers of Prime Minister Hassan Diab's cabinet which was formed last month after the failure of efforts to establish a new national unity cabinet led by Hariri.
Supporting the government was a ""national duty"", Nasrallah said. ""This is not a party matter. If this government fails, it is not known whether a country will remain for someone to ride in on a white horse and form a new government.""
Analysts have said Hezbollah's role in forming the cabinet could make it trickier for Diab to secure badly needed financial support from Western and Gulf Arab states that are alarmed by the Tehran-backed group's influence in Beirut.
Nasrallah said that while Hezbollah backed the cabinet, it was not ""Hezbollah's government"", adding that opponents who described the cabinet that way were making it more difficult to combat the crisis and damaging Lebanon's international ties.
Lebanon last week asked the International Monetary Fund for technical assistance on dealing with the economic crisis.
Speaking in Dubai, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Lebanon needed urgent and deep structural reforms. ""We are sending a small team to Lebanon ... ""We’ll do our best to give a diagnostics recommendation on measures to take but the taking is in the hands of Lebanon,"" she said."

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A short drive from the heavily secured five-star Islamabad hotel where international VIPs will discuss the future of Afghan refugees on Monday, 20-year old Ahmed Khan Younis lives in a makeshift settlement where the houses are made of mud. 
Born in Pakistan to Afghan parents, Unis has no Pakistani citizenship and dreams of going ""home"" once a peace deal is signed, but he is worried about the conditions in a nation where the economic and social framework has been devastated by more than 40 years of war.
""I want to tell these leaders to bring peace to our country, so we can go,"" he said, adding he was worried about how he could complete his dream of studying to become an engineer.
The United States has reached agreement with the Taliban militants on a week-long reduction of violence that could lead to a U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, a senior administration official said on Friday, while cautioning that the insurgents must honor commitments for the accord to stick.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he thought there was a ""good chance"" the United States would reach an agreement with the Taliban by the end of February, more than 18 years after a U.S.-led coalition ousted them from power.
But the prospect of a peace pact is raising more questions than answers, refugees and humanitarian agencies say, when it comes to the future of Afghan refugees – one of the largest and most protracted displacements in modern history.
About three million Afghans live in Pakistan, with more in neighboring Iran, many of them struggling to get full access to education, health and employment. 
The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR is alarmed that at a time of increasing fatigue among global donors, rising insular policies by governments and a possible formal end to war, millions of refugees risk falling through the cracks either in their host nations or in Afghanistan.
'TIME TO WALK THE TALK'
In Khan's settlement, nestled around the campus of one of Pakistan's top universities, there is one school for more than 1,000 children, meaning fewer than a fifth attend. The medicine has run out in the dispensary and the mud houses suffer badly when it rains.
""This is the generation that's going to build Afghanistan... it's really important not just from the refugee perspective but for the stability, peace, security perspective to invest,"" Indrika Ratwatte, the Asia director of UNHCR, told Reuters.
""Now I think it's time to really up the game and walk the talk."" 
The two-day conference, including U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterrez and the U.S. Afghanistan envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, will highlight the need for international support to reintegrate Afghan refugees and to help Pakistan and Iran, home to 90% of Afghan refugees, shoulder the load.
""Tomorrow's conference I think is an opportunity for international members, including China, to commit more,"" Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing told Reuters.
""Peace can be expected in the near future.""
Some refugees say they worry about being forced to go to Afghanistan if a deal is struck with the Taliban, who still control large swathes of the country, without that translating to peace and respect for human rights. 
Saleema Rehman, 28, born in Pakistan, won a prized annual slot available for refugees in Pakistan's Punjab province to study medicine. Now in her last year of gynaecology training, she faces an uncertain future, unable to practise in Pakistan once her training is complete as she is not a citizen.
She is also sceptical about the prospect of being allowed to work in Afghanistan after a peace deal, with the Taliban in some sort of power-sharing agreement. The militants banned women from working, studying or even leaving their homes without a male relative during their 1996-2001 rule. 

""We live in fear,"" she told Reuters. ""We are the third generation, my nephew and niece are the fourth generation, in Pakistan. We never experienced any war and we don't want to go back to the area where peace is uncertain.""

Relations between Tehran and Washington reached crisis point in 2018 after U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 pact between Iran and world powers under which Tehran accepted curbs to its nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions.
Tensions spiked further following the killing of Iran's most prominent military commander Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3 by U.S. drone attacks at Baghdad airport. In retaliation, Iran attacked U.S. targets in Iraq in January. 
Trump has adopted a policy of ""maximum pressure"" to force Tehran to negotiate a broader deal that further curbs Iran's nuclear work, ends its missile program and its involvement in regional proxy wars. 
""Iran will never negotiate under pressure ... We will never yield to America's pressure and we will not negotiate from a position of weakness,"" Rouhani said in a televised news conference.
Although the reimposed U.S. sanctions have crippled Iran’s economy, slashing its oil exports, Tehran has repeatedly dismissed talks over any new deal, saying they are possible only if the United States returns to the pact and lifts trade curbs.
""America's 'maximum pressure' toward Iran is doomed to failure ... our enemy (the United States) is very well aware that their pressure is inefficient,"" Rouhani said. 
Iran has been involved in decades of regional proxy wars with its key regional rival Saudi Arabia, from Syria to Iraq. European and Arab states have since scrambled to avert a full-fledged conflict between the two sides.
""Securing peace and stability in the sensitive region of Middle East and in the Persian Gulf is impossible without Iran's help,"" Rouhani said. 
""Several countries have delivered messages to us (from Saudi Arabia) ... we don't have issues with Saudi Arabia that cannot be resolved,"" he said. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Saturday Riyadh had contacted Iran after the killing of Soleimani, but when Iran had responded the contact had ended. He suggested the United States had pressured Riyadh.

Zarif's comments were dismissed by his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud who said there had been neither private messages nor direct contacts between the two countries.

Former prime minister Matteo Renzi, who heads Italia Viva, challenged Conte last week to put together another government if he could following a row over legal reform.
Conte saw the Italian head of state at the weekend amid speculation that he was seeking to poach senators from Renzi’s party to keep his administration afloat in parliament.
However, his office denied widespread media reports that he was looking for other majorities and played a conciliatory tone.
""Conte is working on the government's 2023 agenda along with all the ruling parties, including Italia Viva,"" Conte's office said in a statement released on Sunday.
While the row between Renzi and Conte seems unlikely to trigger a political crisis any time soon, it underscores the difficulties the prime minister has in keeping a stable coalition after his first government made up of the 5-Star and the right-wing League party collapsed in August.
""Renzi's behavior poses serious problems because it make Conte unstable and the government action insufficient,"" said prominent PD member Goffredo Bettini on Sunday.

Turkey and Russia have collaborated on a political solution to the Syrian conflict but back opposing sides, and a Syrian government offensive in Idlib has raised tensions between them.
""We told (Russia on Saturday) ...that the aggression in Idlib must stop and that a lasting ceasefire has to be achieved now,"" Cavusoglu told reporters in Germany after the Munich Security Conference.
Turkish and Russian officials will discuss the issue in Moscow on Monday, he added.
Russia supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey backs Syrian rebels looking to oust him in the nearly nine-year war.
The Russian-backed offensive marks a major strategic accomplishment for Assad, having driven insurgents from the main highway between Aleppo and Damascus to reopen the fastest route between Syria's two biggest cities for the first time in years. 
Recently, Syrian forces have turned their focus to an area northwest of Aleppo where they are trying to seize more ground to push rebels away from the city. Russian warplanes mounted heavy air strikes in the area on Sunday, bombing towns including Anadan, activists reported.
A suicide bomber with the main insurgent group in the area, the jihadist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham faction, blew himself up in an attack on Russian positions in the town of Kafr Aleppo, the Ibaa news outlet affiliated with the group reported.
In a meeting with Iranian parliament speaker Ali Larijani, Assad said ""the Syrian nation was determined to liberate all Syrian land from terrorism"", Syria's state news agency SANA reported.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said his military will drive back Syrian forces if they do not withdraw out of Idlib by the end of the month. On Saturday, he appeared to pull that date forward, saying Turkey would ""handle it"" before the end of the months if there was no pullback.
Cavusoglu also said he met with some U.S. lawmakers at the conference, saying Washington should work to improve its relations with Ankara anyway, not just due to current tensions between Turkey and Russia. 

""We told them that we expected a sincere approach from the United States in line with our spirit of alliance,"" he said.

According to the Central Election Commission (CEC), the ruling Yeni Azerbaijan (New Azerbaijan) party won 72 out of 125 seats in the single-chamber parliament last Sunday, with nearly all other seats going to small parties and independents loyal to President Ilham Aliyev.
Before Sunday's unauthorized protest was scheduled to start, police detained either at their homes or outside their party headquarters the leader of the REAL party, Ilgar Mamedly, the leader of the Musavat Party, Arif Gajily, and the head of the D18 opposition movement, Ruslan Izzetly. All three failed to win seats in last week's election.
Dozens of riot police surrounded the election commission's building, where the protest had been due to start from, and put anyone arriving to take part in the demonstration on a bus, a Reuters witness at the scene said.
Some protesters held up posters saying: ""Abolish election results!"" or ""We demand free elections!""
Police officials declined to comment on arrests.
International monitors found widespread procedural violations in the vote count, which they said raised doubt about the honesty of the election. Aliyev had called the election nine months early to consolidate his authority and speed economic reforms.
The CEC has so far canceled the results in four election constituencies following reports about violations.
Azerbaijan has been governed by Aliyev since 2003 when he succeeded his late father Heydar.
Western nations have courted Azerbaijan because of its role as an alternative to Russia in supplying oil and gas to Europe, but various European bodies and rights groups have accused Aliyev of muzzling dissent and jailing opponents, charges Baku denies."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Hundreds of passengers were preparing to be evacuated from a cruise ship on Sunday after spending two weeks under quarantine off Japan over the coronavirus, with Americans expected to begin flying home on chartered planes as soon as Sunday evening.
Seventy more people were confirmed with the virus on board the Diamond Princess on Sunday, bringing the number of cases from the ship to 355, the most anywhere outside China.
Canada, South Korea, Hong Kong and Italy have followed the United States in announcing flights to bring home their citizens from the ship, which has been under quarantine since Feb. 3.
Countries have said passengers should be symptom-free to board the flights, and are likely to face quarantine on arrival.
An announcement from the captain blared over loudspeakers on Sunday, informing American guests who were willing to disembark that they were scheduled to leave from 9 p.m. (1200 GMT)
""Leaving in a few hours. No details. Might be going to Texas or Nebraska,"" Gay Courter, one of the American passengers on board, told Reuters. She said she expected to spend another two weeks in quarantine on U.S. soil. 
Another American passenger, Matthew Smith, posted a photo on Twitter showing a fleet of about 11 coaches parked on the shore near the ship to transport U.S. nationals. 
Smith said American officials, dressed in full hazmat suits and face masks, had visited his room to check if he would disembark. He said he wanted to stay.
Yardley Wong, a passenger from Hong Kong, told Reuters: ""We are planning to leave if we test negative,"" although she said she had yet to receive any official notice from Hong Kong authorities.
The ship, owned by Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp., has been held in the Japanese port of Yokohama with 3,700 passengers and crew on board since a man who had disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus two weeks ago.
Those with the disease have been taken to hospital in Japan and no one from the ship has died. Around half of the guests onboard are from Japan.
The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said passengers and crew on board the ship were at high risk of exposure to the virus and it recommended that its citizens get off and take one of the flights home.
""This is a rapidly evolving situation and we are taking additional steps to assist U.S. citizens,"" it said.
All passengers would be screened before being allowed to board the chartered flights and everyone would be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival back in the United States.
""No symptomatic or infected passengers will be allowed to board,"" it said.
Clyde Smith, 80, who was taken from the ship to a Tokyo hospital after testing positive for the virus, told Reuters on Sunday he had not been told if he would be allowed on a U.S. evacuation plane.
Latest figures from Beijing on Sunday showed 68,500 cases of the illness and 1,665 deaths, mostly in Hubei province. 

Japan detected six fresh cases of the coronavirus on Sunday, apart from those on the ship, NHK reported, taking the total number of in-land infections to 59.

MUNICH (Reuters) - An arms embargo aimed at curbing fighting in Libya has become meaningless because of violations and it is imperative that those who breach it are held to account, a senior U.N. official said on Sunday.
""The arms embargo has become a joke, we all really need to step up here,"" U.N. Deputy Special Representative to Libya Stephanie Williams (NYSE:WMB) said after a meeting of foreign ministers to follow up on a Berlin summit last month that agreed to uphold the embargo. Fighting has continued despite a call for a truce.
""It's complicated because there are violations by land, sea and air, but it needs to be monitored and there needs to be accountability,"" Williams told a news conference, adding that Libya was now awash with advanced weapons.
Several countries backing rival factions in Libya have repeatedly violated an arms embargo, according to the United Nations, which has previously named the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey for breaching the embargo. After the Berlin conference the violations increased and the U.N. denounced them without naming countries. 
The Libyan National Army led by eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar and forces aligned with the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli have been fighting since April last year for control of the capital.
The UAE and Egypt support Haftar while the GNA is backed by Turkey. 
A joint statement issued on Sunday by 13 countries involved in Libya, included Egypt, UAE and Turkey, said there had been a discussion on the ""deplorable"" arms embargo violations and ""renewed determination to contribute to its thorough implementation.""
However, there was no mention of how the embargo would be monitored, enforced or whether there would be any consequences for violating it. 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he wanted EU foreign ministers to make a decision on Monday on their role in monitoring the embargo. 
""Everyone needs to know that - if they violate the embargo in future - then they violate a U.N. resolution and that this can't remain without consequences,"" Maas said, without elaborating. 
The head of the GNA, Fayez al-Serraj, said on Saturday that the country faces a financial crisis because of a blockade of oil terminals and oil fields by Haftar.

""The situation on the ground remains deeply troubling. The truce is holding only by a thread... the economic situation continues to deteriorate,"" the U.N.'s Williams said.

The CDU was thrown into disarray this week when leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer stood down little over a year into the job. She must now find a successor to steer the conservative party through the election, due by Oct. 2021, after Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would not seek a fifth term.
Merz narrowly edged Greens leader Robert Habeck, by 37% to 35%, when voters were asked which of the two they would pick to run the country, Bild am Sonntag said.
The other contenders for the CDU leadership, North Rhine-Westphalia state premier Armin Laschet and Health Minister Jens Spahn would lose a head-to-head context with Habeck, the poll showed.
None of the three have yet formally declared their candidacies.
Germany does not elect its chancellors directly, but the snap poll by Kantar gives an indication of who might be the biggest draw on election day.
In its regular tracking poll for Bild am Sonntag, Kantar put the conservative alliance of the Christian Democrats and their Bavarian CSU partner party stable at 28% - down from 33% at the last national election - while the Greens were also unchanged on 20%.
The Social Democrats, Merkel's junior coalition partners, were on 15%, as was the far-right Alternative for Germany."

The waterway between Iran and Oman - 33 km (21 miles) wide at its narrowest point - is the conduit for some 30% of all crude and other oil liquids traded by sea.
Friction between Iran and the West had led several nations to send task forces to guard shipping there, and Washington has blamed Tehran for attacks on international merchant vessels in or near the area, something Tehran denies.
""There are a lot of military ships in the Hormuz (area) and our concern is there could be a mistake,"" Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah said late on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference.
That would make that area the riskiest flashpoint in the Gulf over the coming months, he added.
Iran cannot legally close the waterway unilaterally because part of it is in Omani territorial waters. However, ships that sail it pass through Iranian waters, which are under the responsibility of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Navy.
Tehran has also threatened reprisals for the Jan. 3 killing of its top military commander, Qassem Soleimani, in a U.S. drone strike, though regional analysts have said that is unlikely to involve an intervention in the Strait.
Washington, which in 2018 decided to pull out of an international nuclear deal with Iran and re-impose sanctions on it, is leading a naval mission to protect oil tankers and cargo ships that includes Britain.
France leads a separate European mission, and Japan, Russia, South Korea and China have also sent naval assets to the region.
There have been periodic confrontations between the Iranian Guards and the U.S. military in the Gulf in recent years. U.S. officials have said closing the Strait would be crossing a ""red line"" and America would take action to reopen it.

""The only thing for Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar is the Strait of Hormuz and if it is blocked we will all be in trouble so that's why it is important to maintain the safeguard of maritime navigation,"" Kuwait's foreign minister Sheikh Ahmad Nasser al-Mohammad al-Sabah told the same conference.

The EU is the world's largest trading bloc but it often fails to speak with one voice on foreign policy because its policy-making requires consensus among members. EU governments are divided on issues from Libya to Venezuela.
""Europe has to develop an appetite for power,"" the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told the Munich Security Conference, stressing that did not only mean military power.
""We should be able to act ... not everyday making comments, expressing concern,"" he told leaders, lawmakers and diplomats.
With its economic power, the bloc has been able to boast of a ""soft power"", but its influence in the world has waned, partly because U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First""' policies have undermined European priorities.
Trump's decision to pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, as well as the Paris climate accord, his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital before a final peace settlement and his criticism of NATO are at odds with European positions.
With new leadership in Brussels, the EU has launched into a flurry of diplomacy since January, particularly on the Middle East.
But the bloc was still divided on how to react to Trump's peace proposal for the Palestinians and Israel. Efforts to revive a maritime mission off Libya to uphold a U.N. arms embargo have run into difficulties, diplomats say.
""When there is no unanimity (in the EU), the remaining majority have to act,"" Borrell said."

The men were arrested on Friday, four on suspicion of forming a right-wing terrorist organization last September and the rest of offering them financial support. .
They were planning to stage attacks on politicians, asylum seekers and Muslims, and a federal court judge ordered them detained pending further investigations on Saturday, prosecutors said.
Popular support for far-right groups is growing in Germany, notably in the country's former Communist east, as part of a polarization at both ends of the political spectrum that is undermining the mainstream establishment that been in government since World War Two.
The men, aged between 20 and 50, named their group 'Der harte Kern' (The Hard Core), the Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported on Sunday, saying they had been arrested in six different states.
The suspects, some with blankets draped over their heads, were escorted by police wearing balaclavas and body armor into the Federal Court in Karlsruhe for Saturday's hearing, Reuters TV footage showed.
Citing investigators, Welt am Sonntag said the men had got to know each other via WhatsApp, a messaging service owned by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and met up subsequently. The group was put under surveillance in late summer 2019.
In the raids, investigators found stores of materials that could be used to produce home-made bombs, the newspaper wrote.
No further comment was immediately available from federal prosecutors.
German law allows for individuals suspected of being on the verge of committing serious offences to be detained for up to six months, extendable to 12 months in extreme cases, according to legal experts."

A report in the Financial Times said China had offered to build the rail line, known as HS2, in five years and for less money.
""I've certainly had no advice on the subject, obviously I will be asking to see what the communication has been,"" Shapps told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hundreds of demonstrators rallied for a second day in Hong Kong on Sunday to protest against plans to turn some buildings into coronavirus quarantine centers, reviving anti-government protests in the Chinese-ruled city.
The virus has opened a new front for protesters after months of demonstrations over the perceived erosion of freedoms had largely fizzled out over the past month, as people stayed at home amid fears of a community outbreak of the virus.
About 100 people braved rain in the New Territories district of Fo Tan, where authorities plan to use a newly built residential development that was subsidized by the government as a quarantine center. Riot police stood by.
A 38-year-old mother of two said she had waited eight years for her home in the Chun Yeung estate and was expecting to get her keys by the end of this month.
""There's no consultation and we don't know how long they'll use Chun Yeung estate. That's why we are so mad,"" she the woman.
Father-of-two Koby, 36, also expressed frustration at not being told for how long the public housing might be used for quarantine.
""I've waited eight years. I have two children studying in kindergarten and have already transferred them to the school in Fo Tan,"" he said.
Protesters gathered in other districts on Sunday.
With Hong Kong property prices among the most expensive in the world, owning a home is a distant dream for many, and frustration over housing has triggered protests in the past.
Many Hong Kong people, already angry about what they see as meddling by Beijing in the former British colony's affairs - which it denies - have criticized the government's handling of the virus scare, piling pressure on embattled city leader Carrie Lam.
On Friday, the government sought to appease families that have been allocated a flat in the Fo Tan estate by pledging a special subsidy.
Three weeks ago, protesters set alight the lobby of a newly built residential building in another district in the New Territories, that authorities had planned to use as a quarantine facility. The government dropped the plan.
Hong Kong has had 57 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. One person has died of it in the city.
Some Hong Kong people have called on the city government to seal the border with the mainland to block the virus but Lam has ruled that out."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The National Basketball Association All-Star Game MVP Award has been permanently named for the late Kobe Bryant, league Commissioner Adam Silver said on Saturday.
Bryant, an 18-time All-Star who won a record-tying four All-Star Game MVP awards, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash near Los Angeles on Jan. 26. He was 41.
""His loss, together with his daughter and those other seven people on the helicopter, is unspeakable,"" Silver said at a news conference before the All-Star Saturday Night event at the United Center in Chicago. ""As the father of a child ... that's the unimaginable.""
The Kobe Bryant MVP Award will be presented on Sunday to the most valuable player at the end of the 2020 NBA All-Star Game.
“Kobe Bryant is synonymous with NBA All-Star and embodies the spirit of this global celebration of our game,” Silver said in a statement. “He always relished the opportunity to compete with the best of the best and perform at the highest level for millions of fans around the world.”
Bryant made his NBA All-Star Game debut in 1998 at age 19 – the youngest player to ever play in an All-Star Game. His 18 All-Star selections are the second most in NBA history behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, at 19.
Silver said the decision to name the MVP award in honor of Bryant was made collectively by league officials and some players.
""To all of us, it seemed like the appropriate way to bring honor to him,"" Silver said. 
Silver also spoke about the loss of former NBA Commissioner David Stern, who oversaw explosive growth in the popularity of the game during his 30-year tenure. Silver said that Stern, who died in January, and Bryant had a lot in common. 
""They were both determined to win,"" he said. ""They could be difficult at times because they prioritized winning, and often, they didn't have time for some of the niceties around personal relationships because it was about winning."" 

Moments after Silver's news conference ended, the packed United Center stood and cheered as the game clock was wound up to 24.2, in honor of Bryant's No. 24 jersey number and the No. 2 that Gianna Bryant wore when she played basketball at her father's Mamba Sports Academy.

KABUL (Reuters) - Gunmen shot dead nine homeless drug users in the Afghan capital, officials said on Sunday, shining a light on chronic drug abuse in the world's biggest producer of opium but a rare incident of apparently coordinated violence against addicts.
The motive for the Saturday night attack by the unidentified gunmen in Kabul was not known and police said they were investigating. The men had been sleeping in an open area and a forensic examination had shown they were drug users.
""The shooting took place at the side of the Qrough mountain,"" a spokesman for Kabul police, Ferdaus Faramarz, told Reuters.
There are an estimated 2.5 million drug users in Afghanistan, the Ministry of Public Health says, with most thought to addicted to heroin made from opium poppies grown in Afghanistan.
Some 20,000 drug users are homeless, with half that number in Kabul, at times straining relations with residents of some communities.
""It's a social crisis,"" said Dr Shokoor Haidari, deputy of the ministry's counter drugs department.
The ministry can only treat 40,000 people a year but far more seek help, said Haidari.
Lack of social services, unemployment and easy access to drugs have fueled drug abuse in Afghanistan, Haidari said.
Harsh winter weather killed at least 50 homeless drug users in the past two months, the Ministry of Public Health said.
Afghanistan has been the world's biggest producer of opium for years despite some $8.9 billion spent since 2002 by the U.S. government to stop production and trafficking in narcotics.
With compelling economic incentives and politically protected networks - from cultivators to producers and distributors - deeply entrenched, officials say there is little they can do to stop it.
The Interior Ministry this month announced the arrest of five top police officials, including the head of Kabul's counter-narcotics force, for suspected involvement in drug trafficking."

Washington has blamed Iran-backed paramilitary groups for increasingly regular rocketing and shelling of bases hosting U.S. forces in Iraq and of the area around the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. 
An attack last month hit the U.S. Embassy compound itself, and a rocket attack on a military base in the north in December killed a U.S. civilian contractor.
There have been no claims for the attacks.
Tension between Iran and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has mostly played out on Iraqi soil in recent months. 
The United States killed top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a drone strike in Baghdad last month, after which the region braced for full-scale conflict. Iran launched its first direct missile attack on two bases hosting U.S. forces in response.
Sunday's attack, before dawn, was carried out with ""small rockets"" and caused no casualties, the coalition spokesman said in a statement on Twitter. He provided no further details.
An Iraqi military statement said three Katyusha rockets had hit the fortified Green Zone which hosts the U.S. Embassy, other foreign missions and Iraqi government buildings. It said a fourth hit a nearby logistics base for Iraqi paramilitary groups.
Iraq, caught between its two allies Washington and Tehran, also faces an unprecedented domestic crisis as months of anti-government unrest continues. 
Protesters, whose numbers have reduced from the hundreds of thousands who took to the streets in October, are still demanding the overhaul of Iraq's political system and ruling elite which they say are corrupt.
Prime Minister-designate Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi said on Saturday that the formation of a new government would take place in the coming week. 
He said his appointments would consist of independent ministers free from the influence of parties, including Iran-backed Shi'ite groups, that have controlled cabinet posts and state institutions since the U.S.-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003.

SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (Reuters) - More tests are needed to confirm that an American passenger from a cruise ship docked in Cambodia has the new coronavirus after she tested positive in Malaysia, the MS Westerdam's operator said on Sunday.
The 83-year-old woman was the first passenger from the MS Westerdam, operated by Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp unit Holland America Inc, to test positive for the virus.
""While the first results have been reported, they are preliminary at this point and we are awaiting secondary testing for confirmation,"" Holland America said in a statement.
Cambodian authorities called on Malaysia to review its test results.
Holland America said 236 passengers and 747 crew remained aboard the vessel, which is docked in the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville.
It arrived on Thursday carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew. It had spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand.
The passengers were tested regularly on board and Cambodia also tested 20 once it docked. None was found to have the new coronavirus that has killed more than 1,500 people, the vast majority in China.
The American woman flew to Malaysia on Friday from Cambodia along with 144 others from the ship, the Malaysian health ministry said in a statement, adding that she was in stable condition. 
The woman's husband had shown symptoms but tested negative, it said. The couple were the only ones among the 145 to show symptoms, the ministry said.
Cambodia's government said its own tests had been done in collaboration with the World Health Organisation and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""The Ministry of Health requests the Malaysian authorities to review the results of the test,"" Cambodia's Ministry of Health said in statement.
There are widespread fears that cruise ships around Asia may be spreading the virus. The biggest cluster outside China has been on the Diamond Princess, quarantined off Japan's Yokohama. Out of about 3,700 passengers and crew on board, 285 people have tested positive and been sent to hospital.
Vietnam turned back two ships on Friday.
The American woman's case brings the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Malaysia to 22. 
An 80-year-old Chinese tourist infected with the coronavirus has died in France, the first fatality in Europe and the fourth outside mainland China.

Most of the deaths so far have been in the central Chinese province of Hubei, where the virus is believed to have originated at a wildlife market.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's military on Saturday held exercises that deployed civilian militia and armored vehicles in the capital Caracas and around the country, an effort by President Nicolas Maduro to show strength as Washington prepares to escalate sanctions.
Maduro accuses the United States of preparing an invasion of the OPEC nation, which in 2017 U.S. President Donald Trump described as a possibility. Since last year the United States has ramped up economic sanctions against his government.
The exercises were launched days after Maduro formally incorporated the civilian reserve, a group of some 4 million volunteers with limited military training, into the armed forces alongside the army, navy, air force and National Guard.
""We have proven the level of command and control of the Bolivarian militia, complemented by the National Bolivarian Armed Forces,"" said Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino in statements broadcast on state television.
In one exercise seen by Reuters along a highway in eastern Caracas, a group of several hundred people including soldiers and militia members participated in a 10-minute drill that involved blocking ""invaders"" from entering the capital.
They were joined by civilian members of the ruling Socialist Party dressed in red shirts who served as look-outs, while soldiers drove armored vehicles.
The ""invaders"" were represented by a group of cars that blocked the highway.
Maduro's adversaries dismiss such exercises as theatrics meant to disguise the decay of the armed forces amid hyperinflation that has made Venezuelan salaries - including those of soldiers - insufficient to buy basic food.
""It's a propaganda exercise by the dictatorship today,"" opposition leader Juan Guaido said in a press conference.
""I say to the armed forces ... we are with you, we know about those malnourished soldiers.""
Maduro has held on to power despite the country's economic crisis in large part because of support from the military.
The United States has implemented a broad sanctions program against his government and has urged the armed forces to turn against him.
State Department officials this month said they plan new measures to increase the pressure on Maduro, who says the sanctions are to blame for the country's economic problems."

Benjamin Griveaux, one of Macron's closest lieutenants, abandoned his bid to become mayor of Paris on Friday after it was alleged he sent sexual images of his genitals to a woman who is not his wife. Griveaux has not disputed that he sent the messages.
Pyotr Pavlensky, who has lived in exile in France, said he had posted the sex video to expose Griveaux's ""hypocrisy"".

It added that Griveaux had filed a complaint on Saturday afternoon for privacy violation and that an investigation had been opened.
Under French law, so-called ""revenge porn"", or the publishing of pornographic material without a person's content, can be punished by up to two years in prison and a 60,000-euro ($65,000) fine.

However shortly after Alexander Donskoy unveiled his ""Putin is Russia?"" project in Istiklal Street, authorities took down his paintings because he had not received permission to display them there.
""Currently, we have an exacerbation of relations with Turkey,"" artist Alexander Donskoy told Reuters. ""So, I show here, right in the center of Turkey, on its main street where the Russian embassy is at, that Putin is Russia.""
""I wanted to draw attention to how Putin is taken in Russia: like a superhero. So I wrote on portraits 'Putin is superhero',"" Donskoy said.
Turkey and Russia back opposing sides in the Syrian war but have collaborated to seek a political solution, while forging close ties in the defense and energy sectors.
But a Russian-backed Syrian government offensive since December in the northwestern Idlib region has disrupted ties. Ankara and Moscow have traded barbs in recent days, accusing each other of flouting agreements to curb violence in Idlib.
Media reports this week have cited the Russian ambassador to Turkey as saying he had received several death threats since tensions flared after 13 Turkish troops were killed in Idlib in Syrian government attacks.
Donskoy said he wanted to provoke emotions in people passing by the paintings and see their reactions. He said he planned to hold more exhibits elsewhere, including in the United States.

Yemen has been mired in fighting since the Iran-backed Houthi movement ousted the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi from the capital in late 2014.
A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore him. The conflict is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and its regional foe, Shi'ite Muslim Iran.
The United Nations has been trying to re-launch political negotiations to end the war and, separately, Riyadh has been holding informal talks with the Houthis since late September about de-escalation.
""We have a back channel and it's not yet ready to move to the highest level,"" Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud told the Munich Security Conference.
""It's making progress. We have seen some deterioration recently, but we are committed to moving it forward,"" he added, referring to a recent rise in military activity by the Iran-backed rebels.
After a lull in hostilities in recent months on many fronts, violence has escalated at a frontline east of Yemen's Houthi-held capital Sanaa, since a Jan. 19 missile attack on a government military camp that killed more than 100 people.

Prince Faisal said Saudi would continue to respond to attacks, but that the recent Houthi assaults were not yet at the point that they were endangering the back-channel talks.

A notice issued on Friday by the FAA rescinded restrictions imposed on U.S. air carriers in early January that prohibited flights over large swaths of the Gulf and the Gulf of Oman as tensions rose between Iran and the United States.
“Iran has de-escalated its military posture in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman as of early February 2020,” said the notice. “Given the de-escalation, the FAA assesses there is sufficient reduced risk of Iranian military miscalculation or misidentification that could affect U.S. civil aviation operations.”
The notice applied to the airspaces of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.
The FAA, however, advised U.S. carriers to “exercise caution and avoid operating” near the boundaries of the Tehran flight information region “whenever possible.”
“Military posturing and political tensions in the region remain elevated, and there remains some inadvertent risk to U.S. civil aviation operations due to the potential for miscalculation or misidentification,” it said. “The situation in the region remains fluid and could quickly escalate if circumstances change.”
It cited the Jan. 8 accidental downing by Iran of a Ukrainian passenger jet shortly after it departed Tehran’s international airport, killing all 176 people aboard, as showing the inadvertent risk to civilian flights during periods of heightened military tensions.
Iranian forces downed the plane hours after firing missiles at bases in Iraq hosting U.S. troops.

ANKARA/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Turkey dismissed on Saturday Russian accusations that it has flouted de-escalation agreements with Russia and Iran in Syria's Idlib province, and threatened to take military action in the area if diplomatic efforts with Moscow fail.
Turkey and Russia, which back opposing sides in Syria's war, agreed in 2018 to set up a de-escalation zone in the northwestern province. But their fragile cooperation has been disrupted by a Syrian government offensive in Idlib, in which 13 Turkish soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks.
Ankara has said it will use military power to drive back the Syrian forces unless they withdraw by the end of February, and President Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey will strike government forces anywhere in Syria if another Turkish soldier was hurt.
Erdogan discussed the situation in separate phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday and U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday, but there was no immediate word of a diplomatic breakthrough.
Russia, which backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, says Turkey, which has poured military forces into Idlib, has aggravated the situation and failed to neutralize militants there.
But Turkey blames the situation on the advances by Syrian government forces in Idlib.
""We cannot overlook the cruelty happening in our neighbor,"" Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told broadcaster NTV. ""Turkey has fulfilled its responsibilities in Idlib.""
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey wanted to resolve matters with Russia over Idlib through diplomacy. But, speaking during an international security conference in Munich, he added: ""If it won't work through diplomatic channels, we will take the necessary steps.""
Ankara has been angered by the seizure by Syrian government forces of Turkish military observation posts established in Idlib under the 2018 deal.
""It is impossible for us to remain silent against their siege. We are doing what is necessary against them,"" NTV quoted Erdogan as saying on a flight back from Pakistan.
Erdogan also chided the United States, a NATO ally, saying U.S. statements of support did not instill trust.
Speaking in Istanbul later on Saturday, Erdogan again said Turkey would drive back Syrian forces unless they withdrew to the borders outlined by Ankara and Moscow in 2018. But he also appeared to bring forward his end-of-February deadline.
""The solution in Idlib is the (Syrian) regime stopping its hostility and withdrawing to the borders in the agreements. Otherwise, we will handle this before the end of February,"" Erdogan said.
""We would like to do this with the support of our friends. If we have to do it the hard way, we are also up for that,"" he said, apparently referring to Ankara's Western allies.
""Until we clear Syria of terrorist organizations and the cruelty of the (Syrian) regime, we will not rest easy.""
TALKS
Despite the tough rhetoric, Russian and Turkish officials are talking behind the scenes. Turkish and Russian officials held talks in Ankara on Saturday and Cavusoglu said a Turkish delegation would go to Moscow on Monday for talks.
Cavusoglu also had talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Munich on Saturday - the first ministerial level meeting between Ankara and Moscow since the situation deteriorated in Idlib.
Cavusoglu tweeted that he had a ""positive meeting"" with Lavrov but that Turkey would not be ""making an evaluation"" until after Monday's talks in Moscow. Lavrov said Russia had very good ties with Turkey, but the sides did not always agree on issues.
Cavusoglu was also quoted by Russian news agencies as saying differences over Syria should not affect Ankara's relations with Moscow or disrupt a contract for the purchase of Russian S-400 missile defense systems which has strained Turkey's ties with Washington.
Erdogan said his phone call with Putin - his second since the Turkish troops were killed - had been positive and that statements by other Russian officials that criticized Turkey did not reflect the tone of the call. 
However, Erdogan later criticized Russia for its support of Assad in the conflict: ""Russia's efforts to capture land for a regime that is the enemy of its own people is nothing more than extending its life through a respirator. Soon even a respirator won't work and, God willing, the regime will suddenly turn into a corpse.""
In the conflict in Syria, which began in 2011, Turkey has supported rebels looking to oust Assad. Erdogan said this week the Turkey-backed rebels launched an offensive to retake some areas they had lost to Syrian forces.
State-run Anadolu news agency said buses carrying commandoes and trucks with more military equipment had been sent to reinforce the Turkish observation posts.
The increased violence in Idlib has caused hundreds of thousands of people to abandon their homes and head north to the Turkish-Syrian border. Turkey, which hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, has said it cannot handle a new influx. 
Syrian state media said Syrian troops had began clearing barricades from a highway between Damascus and Aleppo after recovering full control of the road for the first time in more than seven years.
Syrian state media also reported advances by Syrian government forces towards rebel-held Atarib, some 24 km (15 miles) west of Aleppo, and three towns to its northwest.

On Friday, Turkish and Syrian state media reported Turkish-backed Syrian rebels shot down a government helicopter west of Aleppo in the Idlib region.

MUNICH (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended on Saturday his nation's global role despite misgivings in Europe, vowing that Western values would prevail over Russian and Chinese desires for ""empire"".
Seeking to reassure Europeans troubled by U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America first"" rhetoric, his ambivalence over the NATO military alliance and tariffs on European goods, Pompeo said there was no crisis in Western leadership.
""I'm happy to report that the death of the transatlantic alliance is grossly exaggerated. The West is winning, and we're winning together,"" he said in a speech at the Munich Security Conference, listing U.S. steps to protect liberal democracies.
Pompeo's Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, accused him of telling ""lies, not based on facts"" about Beijing's intentions.
Pompeo had been, in part, responding to German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who on Friday accused the United States, Russia and China of making the world more dangerous.
French President Emmanuel Macron told the conference of international leaders, lawmakers and diplomats he was not surprised by Steinmeier's speech and had liked it.
""We cannot be the United States' junior partner,"" Macron said, adding that while he supported NATO, Europe needed to be able to tackle threats in its neighborhood and at times act independently of Washington.
""I'm impatient for European solutions,"" Macron said.
Trump's decision to pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, as well as the Paris climate accord, have undermined European priorities, while moves such as recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital have weakened European diplomacy, envoys say.
Pompeo defended the U.S. strategy, saying Europe, Japan and other American allies were united on China, Iran and Russia, despite ""tactical differences.""
Pompeo, however, reiterated Washington's opposition to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline under construction between Russia and Germany under the Baltic Sea, a project backed by the government of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Citing Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, cyber threats in Iran and economic coercion by China, Pompeo said those countries were still ""desiring empires"" and destabilizing the rules-based international system.
Wang responded to Pompeo by saying: ""All these accusations against China are lies, not based on facts.""
But he added that Beijing was willing to sit down with Washington for ""serious dialogue"" and seek a less confrontational relationship.
POLICY OF DEFIANCE
Macron said the West's policy of defiance toward Russia in recent years had failed and, as nobody wanted to confront Moscow directly, the only option was to have a closer dialogue to resolve differences.
""I hear the defiance of all our partners, I'm not mad, but I know that being defiant and weak ... is not a policy, it's a completely inefficient system,"" Macron told the conference.
""There is a second choice, which is to be demanding and restart a strategic dialogue because today we talk less and less, conflicts multiply and we aren't able to resolve them, he added.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, who spoke immediately after Pompeo, focused his remarks solely on China, accusing Beijing of a ""nefarious strategy"" through telecommunications firm Huawei.
""It is essential that we as an international community wake up to the challenges presented by Chinese manipulation of the long-standing international rules-based order,"" Esper said.
He said Washington is working with technology companies in the United States and allied nations to develop alternatives to Chinese 5G vendors and is testing them at U.S. military bases.

He added that it was not too late for Britain, which last month said it would allow Huawei a limited role in building its 5G networks, to take ""two steps back,"" but said he still needed to assess London's decision.

The commission chairman Pierre Claver Ndayicariye told journalists on Friday that the remains of 6,032 victims as well as thousands of bullets were recovered. Clothes, glasses and rosaries were used to identify some of the victims.
The tiny East African nation is struggling to come to terms with a violent past, characterized by suffered colonial occupation, civil war and decades of intermittent massacres.
Referring to a massacre which is believed to have targeted people from the Hutu ethnic group, Ndayicariye said families of the victims were able to ""break the silence"" that was imposed 48 years ago.
Burundi’s population is divided between the Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups. The civil war - which killed 300,000 people before it ended in 2005 - had ethnic overtones. 
The government-run commission was set up in 2014 to investigate atrocities from 1885, when foreigners arrived in Burundi, until 2008, when a stalled peace deal to end the civil war was fully implemented. 
So far it has mapped over 4,000 mass graves across the country and identified more than 142,000 victims of violence. 
Its mandate does not cover most of the rule of the current president, Pierre Nkurunziza, who took office in 2005. 

The United Nations has warned that human rights abuses might increase again ahead of May 2020 elections. Since 2015, when Nkurunziza ran for a third, disputed term in office, hundreds of Burundians have been killed in clashes with security forces.

Juan Jose Marquez was detained on Tuesday on his return to Venezuela after a three-week international tour. He was together with Guaido, who is recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela's legitimate president.
""The preposterous charges that have been put forward further exemplify the increasing desperation of Maduro and his corrupt associates,"" said State Department spokesman Morgan Ortagus in a statement. ""Manufacturing evidence to justify arbitrary, politically motivated detentions is a common tool of the illegitimate former Maduro regime.""
According to the State Department, Marquez was being accused of smuggling explosive material aboard a direct international flight from Portugal. Ortagus scoffed at the charges saying Marquez had gone through strict security screening and protocols at Lisbon airports. He also noted TAP Air Portugal had affirmed publicly that it was impossible to travel with explosives.
""These despicable actions by the former Maduro regime detaining innocent civilians and inventing false charges are sadly typical,"" said Ortagus. ""Rather than abide by the rule of law, Maduro and his cronies follow mafia-style practices, intimidating the opposition by targeting their family members.""
Venezuela’s information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Venezuela's economic collapse under President Nicolás Maduro has prompted nearly 5 million people to emigrate, creating a migration crisis in nearby Latin American nations. Maduro calls Guaido a U.S-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup.
According to the State Department, there were 2,219 arbitrary arrests reported in Venezuela last year, and more than 15,000 were reported from 2014 to 2019."
949,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2020 12:08PM ET</span>",Bosnian police tussle with migrants protesting over camp conditions,"VELIKA KLADUSA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Bosnian police scuffled on Saturday with hundreds of migrants who tried to break out of an overcrowded camp during a protest over conditions at the facility and their treatment by authorities in nearby Croatia.
The Miral camp lies in western Bosnia, just 10 km (six miles) from the Croatian border, and currently houses about 1,000 migrants -- 300 more than its capacity.
Witnesses saw police scuffling with migrants and detaining several people during Saturday's protest, in which the mostly male protesters chanted ""Freedom"", ""Give us our money back"" and ""Stop beating us"".
There were no reports of any injuries.
Many of the migrants' complaints were directed at Croatian border authorities, whom aid groups and migrants have repeatedly accused of violent push backs and mistreatment.
""The Croatian police are very, very bad. We want the border to be opened. Please don't hit us anymore. Don't remove our jackets, shoes and socks. They take it all,"" camp resident Salam Batu told Reuters.
Croatian authorities deny accusations of police brutality.
Bosnia, which saw relatively few people crossing its borders during the big migrant wave of 2015, is now seeing an influx of people trying to reach wealthier nations via European Union-member Croatia.
Although the Balkan route was closed off in 2016, about 50,000 migrants, mainly from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Morocco and Syria, passed through Bosnia in 2019.
Some 6,000 remain stranded in the Balkan country, the majority of them sheltered in poorly equipped facilities in Velika Kladusa, where the Miral camp is located, and Bihac.
""Everybody here wants to go to the border and go to Italy, Germany or France,"" said a man from Pakistan who asked to be named only as Simon.
""If we go to the border, the Croatian police are burning our jackets and shoes, they take mobile phones,"" he told Reuters.
Croatia is preparing to enter the EU's visa-free Schengen zone -- a move that requires compliance with EU standards on border controls and human rights as well as proof that national authorities can effectively manage the bloc's external border.
Bosnia has accused Croatia of returning migrants to Bosnia even when they are found deep within its territory."

CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer plunged the party into crisis on Monday when she gave up her ambitions of succeeding Merkel - a move that raised questions over the future of the conservatives' coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD).
The center-left SPD has signaled it could quit the coalition if Merkel is forced out as chancellor - a scenario that Baerbock said could not be allowed to unfold during Germany's EU presidency, starting on July 1.
""We cannot have a situation in the middle of the EU presidency - when we have big, big questions in Europe - for there to suddenly be a vote of confidence raised in Germany,"" Baerbock told Reuters at the Munich Security Conference.
Her comments suggest the opposition Greens, which are strong contenders to take a role in Germany's next government, are not looking to take advantage of the CDU turmoil any time soon.
Germany's next federal election is due by October 2021.
The CDU is starting a selection process - that could take months - to decide who will lead the party and run as chancellor in that election. The same person will probably, but not necessarily, hold both posts.
The possibility of having a rival as party leader while she remains chancellor may be unworkable and force Merkel, who will not seek re-election after leading Europe's biggest economy for around 15 years, to stand down early.
This could trigger an early election, not least because the SPD have made clear their coalition deal is only with Merkel.
But Baerbock urged the CDU to show stability.
""Germany needs a stable government in the year of the EU Council presidency,"" she said on Saturday. ""Otherwise we don't need to talk about a common European foreign and security policy at all.""
A survey by pollster Forsa on Saturday put support for the Greens at about 24%, second only to the CDU's conservative alliance with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), on 27%."

MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Facing a costly and damaging two-season ban from European football, English champions Manchester City will now turn to the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in an appeal that is likely to focus heavily on procedure.
The Premier League club's key players on the pitch may be the likes of Sergio Aguero, Raheem Sterling and Kevin De Bruyne, but off it their line-up of British and Swiss lawyers will also be in focus as they fight to get the ban overturned.
European soccer's governing body UEFA said on Friday the club had committed ""serious breaches"" of its Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations by ""overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even information submitted to UEFA between 2012 and 2016.""
UEFA will also issue a 30 million euro ($32.5 million) fine to City, who it said had ""failed to cooperate in the investigation"", possibly contributing to the harshness of its punishment.
City said within minutes of UEFA's announcement that they will appeal.
The FFP regulations are designed to stop clubs running up big losses through spending on players and ensure that sponsorship deals are based on real market value and are genuine commercial deals - and not ways for owners to pump cash into a club to get around the rules.
UEFA opened an investigation into City last March after the publication of 'Football Leaks' documents led to allegations that the club’s Abu Dhabi owners had inflated sponsorship agreements to comply with the FFP requirements.
The leaked documents included club emails which referred to money being ""routed"" through sponsors. Reuters was unable to verify if such payments were made. https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/soccer-files-fairplay-mancity
City's response to media reports at the time gave an early indication of the approach they may take at CAS in Lausanne.
""We will not be providing any comment on out of context materials purported to have been hacked or stolen from City Football Group and Manchester City personnel and associated people. The attempt to damage the Club's reputation is organized and clear,"" it said.
As well as questioning the nature of the documents, City have been unhappy at the way in which UEFA's Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) conducted the investigation.
In a statement on Friday, the club referred to the ""flawed and consistently leaked UEFA process"".
""Simply put, this is a case initiated by UEFA, prosecuted by UEFA and judged by UEFA,"" it said.
ATTEMPT TO HALT PROBE
City had turned to CAS in November to try to have the probe halted, arguing that the CFCB's decision to refer the case to its Adjudicatory Chamber was taken ""improperly and prematurely"".
The club's legal team argued that what it viewed as leaks from UEFA to the media about the investigation showed ""UEFA has systematically breached, and continues to breach, its duty of confidence"" in the case.
It also called for UEFA to conduct an inquiry into the alleged leaks.
Although CAS rejected that appeal saying ""internal remedies"" had not been exhausted, it did express concern in its written judgment about the leaks.
Now that the verdict has been handed out and CAS becomes the arena for an appeal, City may well return to these procedural matters as part of their strategy.
At the CAS hearing, City were represented by Monckton Chambers as well as Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in London and Kellerhals Carrard in Lugano, Switzerland.
The club may be pinning their hopes for getting the UEFA ban overturned or greatly reduced on previous FFP cases.
Paris St Germain faced a UEFA investigation over its own FFP declarations and faced no punishment, while AC Milan received a one-year ban - half of City's sanction."

SHANGHAI/PARIS (Reuters) - An 80-year-old Chinese tourist infected with the coronavirus has died in France, the first fatality in Europe and the fourth outside mainland China from an epidemic that has shut Chinese factories, curbed travel and disrupted global supply chains.
The outbreak, thought to have originated at a wildlife market in the central Chinese province of Hubei, has presented China's ruling Communist Party with the huge challenge of halting its spread while at the same time minimizing damage to the world's second-largest economy. 
Beijing's latest figures on Saturday showed 66,492 cases of the illness and 1,523 deaths, mostly in Hubei. Outside mainland China there have been about 500 cases in some two dozen countries and territories, with four deaths - in Japan, Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, the Philippines and France.
In the French case, the Chinese man died at the Bichat hospital in Paris of a lung infection due to the flu-like virus, authorities said on Saturday.
""We have to get our health system ready to face a possible pandemic propagation of the virus, and therefore the spreading of the virus across France,"" said Health Minister Agnes Buzyn.
Robin Thompson, an expert in mathematical epidemiology at Britain’s University of Oxford, said that with nearly 50 cases in Europe, a death was not surprising. ""The most important thing to point out, however, is that there still hasn't been sustained person-to-person transmission in Europe,"" he added. 
After an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. But some cities remain in lockdown, streets are deserted, employees are nervous, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country. 
Those returning to Beijing from the holiday have been ordered to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine to prevent the spread of the virus. Many factories are yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains for everyone from smartphone makers to car manufacturers. 
While there has been some hope expressed this week that the disease may be peaking in China, numbers keep rising and a trend has been hard to discern, especially after a reclassification that widened the definition of cases.
World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was impossible to tell where the epidemic will spread.
""We are concerned by the continued increase in the number of cases in China,"" Tedros told the Munich Security Conference in Germany. ""...We are concerned by the lack of urgency in funding the response from the international community.
""Most of all, we are concerned about the potential havoc this virus could wreak in countries with weaker health systems.""
CRUISE SHIPS
The biggest cluster outside China has been on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, quarantined off Japan's Yokohama. Out of about 3,700 passengers and crew on board, 285 people have tested positive and been sent to hospital. 
The United States said on Saturday it plans to send an aircraft to pick up American passengers and take them back home where they face another two weeks of isolation ""out of an abundance of caution"".
Passengers on another cruise ship, which finally docked in Cambodia on Thursday after being rejected by several other countries, were taking their saga in good heart. 
""Everyone says 'poor you'. But there was no poor you. We had free internet and free wine. We had three-course meals. There was so much choice,"" said Zahra Jennings, a retired staff nurse from Britain who had been on the MS Westerdam with more than 2,300 passengers and crew.
An 83-year-old American woman from the Westerdam had tested positive for the coronavirus on landing in Malaysia, health authorities there said on Saturday.
U.S. President Donald Trump thanked ""beautiful"" Cambodia for taking the castaway cruise ship in a rare message to a nation that has often been at odds with Washington.
The United States has imposed some of the toughest curbs on travelers from China, going beyond WHO recommendations and offending Beijing.
HONG KONG PROTESTS 
In Hong Kong, which has seen months of anti-Beijing protests, hundreds marched on Saturday to demand full closure of the border with mainland China and to oppose plans to turn some buildings into quarantine hubs.
""Doing that (opening such centers) is like creating more wounds rather than trying to stop the bleeding,"" said Chan Mei-lin among the protesters. TV images showed police making some arrests and using pepper spray.
The sickness, now officially labeled Covid-19, has killed around 2% of those infected. Cases have spread faster than other respiratory viruses this century.
A senior Chinese official sought to project optimism.
""The impact of the epidemic on the Chinese economy will be short term and temporary,"" foreign affairs vice minister Qin Gang said at the Munich Security Conference.
""When the epidemic is over, the subdued consumer demand will be released rapidly and the economy will rebound strongly.""
The Chinese central bank said the country's lenders will tolerate higher levels of bad loans as part of efforts to support firms hit by the epidemic.
The economic ripple effects go far beyond China, with supply chain disruptions affecting multiple companies worldwide. 
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the coronavirus might knock two- to three-tenths of a percent off U.S. growth in the first quarter.

The sporting world has suffered too. In the latest disruption, Chinese gymnasts were forced to cancel attendance at next week's World Cup in Melbourne because of Australian travel curbs.

MUNICH (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a former comic actor, joked on Saturday that after dreaming of Oscars and popularity in the United States, he had achieved at least the fame part through President Donald Trump's impeachment. 
Asked at the Munich Security Conference about Ukraine being dragged into U.S. politics, Zelenskiy reverted to his previous career as a comedic actor when he played a fictional president in a popular TV series. 
""I get many questions about impeachment everywhere,"" said Zelenskiy, who took office in 2019.
""In my previous profession as a producer, screenwriter and actor, I wanted an Oscar and wanted to be very popular in the United States. Now I am very popular in the USA, but I didn't want to find (it in) such a way.""
Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives, charged with abusing his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival. He was acquitted this month in the Republican-led Senate.
At the heart of the impeachment case was a transcript of a July 25 telephone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to work with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
""It's like Santa Barbara... or no, Dallas,"" Zelenskiy said, referring to U.S. TV shows and how questions on impeachment repeatedly come back to him. 
The United States has been the most powerful backer of Ukraine in its standoff with Russia over Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea and support for separatist fighters in a simmering conflict in the eastern Donbass region.
Zelenskiy said he wanted to change Ukraine’s global image so that people did not associate the country with corruption. He also thanked the United States for all its help, asked for more and said he was was ready for more time with Trump. 

""If it helps Ukraine, I am ready for the next call with Mr Trump.""

Varosha, a southern suburb of Famagusta, has been fenced off and abandoned since Turkey invaded northern Cyprus after a Greek-inspired coup in 1974.
Ringed by a fence which extends into the sea, the former holiday resort has been off limits to anyone but the Turkish military since its 39,000 Greek Cypriot residents fled advancing Turkish troops.
Speaking in Varosha after touring the area, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said opening Varosha would have benefits for tourism, the economy and trade.
""Keeping this coast of paradise under the sovereignty of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus idle is not acceptable legally, politically or economically,"" Oktay said.
Turkish and northern Cypriot officials were continuing their inventory efforts there, he said.
""There is unfortunately an abandoned area here as well as rotting buildings. Our hope is that Varosha is revived in a way that will revitalize the economic, trade and social life here,"" Oktay said.
Oktay's visit to the region with Turkish and northern Cypriot officials marks one of the most concrete steps by either side towards re-opening Varosha.
The island of Cyprus was divided in 1974. The island's Greek Cypriots live predominantly in the south, and Turkish Cypriots in the north since the 1974 war. Several peacemaking efforts have failed and the discovery of offshore resources has complicated the negotiations."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The United States said it would send an aircraft to Japan to bring back U.S. passengers on the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess, where the most coronavirus infections outside China have occurred.
The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said in a letter on Saturday to passengers that a chartered plane would arrive in Japan on Sunday evening and that it recommended ""out of an abundance of caution"" that U.S. citizens disembark and return home for further monitoring.
The passengers would be required to undergo further quarantine of 14 days upon arriving in the United States and if they choose not to return on the flight, they would not be able to return home ""for a period of time"", the letter said.
""We understand this is frustrating and an adjustment, but these measures are consistent with the careful policies we have instituted to limit the potential spread of the disease,"" it said.
It also said passengers would be screened before the flight and the U.S. government was working with Japan so that any people with symptoms would receive proper care if they could not board the plane.
Japan confirmed it was coordinating with the U.S. government for Americans to leave the ship and return home, saying that would ease its burden in resolving the situation.
Other countries might follow suit and ask to bring back their own citizens from the ship before the quarantine period ends next week, a Japanese government official told reporters.
The cruise ship, owned by Carnival Corp (N:CCL), has been quarantined since arriving in Yokohama on Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong before it traveled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus.
It had some 3,700 passengers and crew on board. Another 67 people have tested positive for the virus, Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Saturday, bringing the total to 285 cases. Those testing positive are transferred to Japanese hospitals.
Japanese public broadcaster NHK has reported that there were more than 400 U.S. citizens on board.
The cruise liner's quarantine is set to end on Wednesday and while some passengers were disheartened at the prospect of more time in quarantine, others were more understanding.
""They are very concerned about spreading the virus, and there’s no good way to transport people from Japan without possible transfer of virus, so it is the logical thing to do,"" Sawyer Smith, 25, told Reuters.
The plane will land at Travis Air Force Base in California and some passengers will then continue onward to Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. 

The letter did not specify how long U.S. citizens who choose not to board the chartered flight might have to wait before they could return home, saying only that the final decision would be up to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It marks a major gain for President Bashar al-Assad, as reopening the M5 highway will restore the shortest route between Syria's two biggest cities for the first time in more than seven years of conflict.
A reporter with state-run al-Ikhbariya news channel, broadcasting from the highway on the Aleppo outskirts, said clearing the barriers started in the early hours of Saturday.
Restoring government control over the M5 has been seen as a major objective of a Russian-backed offensive that has been underway since early December in the rebel-held northwest.
The offensive has forced more than 800,000 people to flee.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which reports on the war using a network of sources on the ground, said government forces had captured a belt of territory around the road, securing it completely.
Observatory Director Rami Abdulrahman told Reuters the Russian-backed offensive may stop now that the road had been secured but added that the government could yet seek to seize more ground north of Aleppo to secure the city.
The reopening of the highway was part of a 2018 agreement between Russia and Turkey which was concluded with the stated aim of stabilizing the situation in the Idlib region of the northwest, a major foothold for the anti-Assad insurgency.
The pact called for establishing a de-militarized zone between the warring sides in addition to the reopening of a second highway, the main road linking Aleppo with the government-held coastal region.
In agreement with Russia, Turkish forces deployed into the northwest at a dozen observation posts.
But tensions have spiraled between Russia and Turkey during the latest offensive, as 13 Turkish soldiers have been killed by Syrian attacks in the past two weeks.
Turkey has vowed to drive back Syrian troops beyond the Turkish observation posts in Idlib by the end of this month.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Saturday Turkey has fulfilled its responsibilities in the Idlib region in line with its de-escalation agreements with Russia and Iran, which also backs Assad."

JUBA, South Sudan (Reuters) - South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir said on Saturday he was cutting the number of states from 32 to 10, unlocking a stalled peace deal and paving the way for the formation of a long- awaited unity government. 
""The compromise we have made today is a painful decision but a necessary one if that is what brings peace"", Kiir said in a statement. ""I expect the opposition to be prepared to do the same.""
The regional group IGAD had given the government until Saturday to find a solution over the number of states the country should have. 
Disagreement between Kiir and former rebel leader Riek Machar over the number of states as well as a failure to integrate different fighting forces have been major obstacles to completing the peace process.
""In general we welcome the decision taken by the president to take the country to 10 states,"" said Manawa Peter, deputy spokesman of Riek Machar, adding, ""this is a win win decision for the people and we commend the president for his wise choice.""
Alan Boswell, a senior analyst with the Brussels-based think-tank International Crisis Group, said: ""This paves a path forward. The peace deal was stuck. Now the parties will need to complete the negotiations to form the long-awaited unity government.""
South Sudan's five-year civil war erupted soon after the country's formation in 2011 and created the worst refugee crisis in Africa since the Rwandan genocide.
Kiir and Riek Machar agreed a peace deal in 2018, pressured by the United Nations, the United States and countries in the region. 

Under the deal, the two agreed to form a unity government by November 2019. They then pushed then the deadline back by 100 days, prompting Washington to recall its ambassador and impose sanctions on senior officials for their role in perpetuating the conflict.

MUNICH (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday he would allow North Macedonia and Albania to begin talks on joining the European Union if the bloc's executive gave them a positive review next month.
Macron's comments at the Munich Security Conference look set to end his freeze on the two Balkan countries' progress towards EU membership and reassure other European leaders that France still backs expanding the bloc to new members. 
""We are waiting for the (European Commission) report in March ... depending on that, if the results are positive and confidence is established, then we should be in a position to open the negotiations,"" Macron told the conference. 
Macron had refused to approve the start of so-called accession negotiations at a summit in October, saying the process of admitting new members needed to change. One French minister called the accession process an ""endless soap opera"".
Worried by Chinese and Russian influence in the six states that aspire to join the bloc - Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia and North Macedonia - Germany and the European Commission said Macron was wrong to block them. 
This month, the Commission suggested reforms to the accession process along the lines of a French proposal made in November, giving EU governments more say and making it easier to stop or reset negotiations and freeze funds.
Macron's shift sets the stage for the 27 EU governments' assent before an EU-Balkan summit in Zagreb in May. Denmark and the Netherlands, who supported Macron's position last year, are expected to drop their resistance, EU diplomats told Reuters.
France and its allies are concerned about the EU's ability to bring in a region scarred by ethnic wars in the 1990s and struggling with crime and corruption, anxious not to repeat what they believe was the rushed accession of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007. Membership talks, once underway, will take years.
Macron also cautioned that so-called EU enlargement was not a panacea for the bloc's difficulties in speaking with one voice and that more members also meant the need for a bigger EU common budget, something northern EU members reject.
""It doesn't work at 27 (EU members) so do you think it will work if we're 32 or 33? We are not coherent,"" Macron said.
""The implicit strategy is that we think of Europe as a big market ... but not a political power with collective preferences and a minimum of convergence.""

Five countries turned away the Westerdam, worried its passengers could be carrying the coronavirus despite it having no known cases before Cambodia's authoritarian prime minister, Hun Sen, agreed the passengers could disembark there.
""Thank you to the beautiful country of Cambodia for accepting the @CarnivalCruise ship Westerdam into your port. The United States will remember your courtesy,"" Trump said in a post on Twitter late on Friday. 
The Westerdam, operated by Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp unit Holland America Inc, docked in the port of Sihanoukville on Thursday after being shunned for two weeks. 
Its 1,455 passengers began to disembark on Friday. 
The passengers were tested regularly on the cruise ship and Cambodia also tested 20 once it docked. None were found to have the new coronavirus that has killed more than 1,500 people, the vast majority in China.
Cambodia's Hun Sen has often sparred with the United States over its accusations of human rights abuses and its condemnation of a crackdown on the opposition since 2017.
He has brought Cambodia much closer to China, which has provided billions of dollars in aid for infrastructure projects and stood by Cambodia in the face of Western criticism.
""We are very grateful that Cambodia opened its port ... We hope that other countries can be equally as helpful to people in need,"" U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia W. Patrick Murphy told reporters at the Westerdam.

BERLIN (Reuters) - A top Chinese official acknowledged on Friday that the new coronavirus is a deep challenge to the country, but defended Beijing's management of the epidemic while lashing out at the ""overreaction"" of other countries.
In a wide-ranging interview with Reuters in the German capital, State Councillor Wang Yi, who also serves as China's foreign minister, urged the United States not to take unnecessary virus-response measures that could hamper trade, travel and tourism. 
""The epidemic overall is under control,"" he said. ""This epidemic is truly sudden. It has brought a challenge to China and the world.""
""We've taken such complete prevention and control efforts, efforts that are so comprehensive, that I can't see any other country that can do this,"" Wang said, adding that any leader in another country would find the challenge very difficult.
""But China has been able to do this.""
The virus, coming on the back of a disruptive trade war between the United States and China, has again exposed underlying tensions on multiple fronts between the world's two biggest economies. 
It has also posed one of the toughest challenges for President Xi Jinping since he assumed power in 2013.
During the roughly 90-minute interview, on topics ranging from the coronavirus to Hong Kong, and the Middle East, Wang repeatedly pinned blame on Washington. 
Beijing has criticized the United States in particular for taking drastic measures on coronavirus, which have included travel curbs on visitors from China. The United States was the first to announce it was evacuating citizens from Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the virus outbreak. 
""Some countries have stepped up measures, including quarantine measures, which are reasonable and understandable, but for some countries they have overreacted, which has triggered unnecessary panic,"" he said.
""I'm sure that those countries are reflecting on this as the situation evolves and the epidemic is gradually brought under further control,"" he said. ""They will gradually release such restrictions. Because at the end of the day, these countries need to interact with China."" 
The U.S. State Department and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while the White House declined to comment. 
Wang rejected the idea that China was not transparent enough in its initial handling of the outbreak. Top Communist Party officials in Wuhan and Hubei province, where the city is located, were sacked this week.
""From the beginning, we took a very open and transparent manner in releasing information to the international community's cooperation on this effort,"" he said, noting that fewer than 1% of global cases have been reported outside of China.
The coronavirus has infected nearly 64,000 people in China and killed more than 1,300. 
""We're not just defending the life, safety and health of Chinese citizens, but also making our contribution for global public health, and that should be recognized,"" he said.
Beijing has urged countries to ease travel restrictions and resume flights after numerous airlines stopped flying to China.
""Only under the leadership of President Xi can we control this sudden epidemic, which has spread so quickly. This is not only to defend the health of the Chinese people, but also will prevent the rapid spread of this epidemic in the world,"" he said.
""We have taken the most correct, the most rigorous and decisive measures to fight against the epidemic. Many measures went beyond international health regulations and the WHO recommendations,"" Wang said.
'IMMORAL' TREATMENT OF HUAWEI
In the far-ranging interview, Wang said he did not understand why the United States was using its power and trying to get its allies to attack a private company like China's Huawei [HWT.UL].
On Thursday, U.S. prosecutors accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets and helping Iran track protesters in its latest indictment against the Chinese firm, escalating the U.S. battle with the world's largest telecoms gear maker.
The United States has been waging a campaign against Huawei, which it has warned could spy on customers for Beijing. Washington placed the company on a trade blacklist last year, citing national security concerns. 
""We don't know why this superpower country is using its state power, and moving its allies to attack Huawei, which is a private company,"" Wang said.
""Why can't a Chinese company succeed based on its own efforts? Why can't America accept that other countries' companies can also display their talent in the economy, in technology?"" he said.
""Perhaps deep down, it doesn't hope to see other countries develop. It doesn't want to see that other countries can become big and strong. It even resorts to rumors to defame other countries' companies,"" he said.
He called U.S. attacks on Huawei ""immoral"" and said there was no credible evidence that the company has a so-called back door that harms U.S. security.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that U.S. officials believe Huawei can covertly access mobile phone networks around the world through ""back doors"" designed for use by law enforcement. Huawei denies the accusations.
PHASE 1 TRADE DEAL INTACT
Wang also said he does not see a need to revisit what was agreed in the Phase 1 trade deal reached with Washington, after questions have arisen as to whether China would be able to fulfill its commitments to make vast purchases of U.S. goods due to the coronavirus outbreak.
""As we implement the Phase 1 trade agreement, we will accumulate experience and then we can consider when we should start Phase 2. I think this is a reasonable approach,"" he said.
Still, he decried U.S. curbs on movement of people between the two countries. 
""Objectively, this will bring some difficulties to implementing this agreement,"" he said.

Wang noted that U.S. President Donald Trump has praised Xi's leadership in China's battle to contain the virus, and that his administration has said it stands ready to spend up to $100 million to assist China and other countries affected by coronavirus.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday renewed pressure on China to join nuclear arms control talks with Washington and Moscow, seeking to overcome Beijing's long-standing opposition to entering such a dialogue.
""China has long said it will never enter into an arms race and does not seek numeric parity with the U.S and Russia. Now is the time for China to put its money where its mouth is, and prove that it is a responsible international actor,"" said a senior Trump administration official.
The official was one of several who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
The nuclear arsenals of the United States and Russia dwarf that of China. But Beijing's military buildup in the Asia-Pacific region has alarmed U.S. allies and policymakers.
President Donald Trump has sought to entice China into joining the United States and Russia in talks on an arms control accord to replace the 2010 New START treaty between Washington and Moscow that expires next February.
China has rejected Trump's proposal, arguing that its smaller nuclear force is defensive and poses no threat.
""Continued silence from China creates uncertainty about their intentions and only brings about the need for a renewed focus on deterrence and military readiness for the United States,"" said one administration official.
New START maintains the only remaining limits on U.S. and Russian nuclear deployments. Some experts and lawmakers have called Trump's proposal to include Beijing in a new treaty a ""poison pill"" strategy aimed at killing New START and ending the restraints on U.S. deployments.
New START restricted the United States and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 nuclear warheads, the lowest level in decades, and limited the land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers that deliver them.
It can be renewed for up to five years if both sides agree. Moscow has offered to immediately extend the treaty. Washington has yet to decide.
""On New START, we have made no decision on a possible extension as we are focused on addressing a broader range of threats beyond just the weapons subject to the treaty,"" said an official.
China is estimated to have about 300 nuclear weapons.
The official said China, ""as a major military power,"" also has major responsibilities.
""You cannot ask for global status without assuming global responsibilities for world order and this is why we believe it is high time for China to participate in arms control alongside the United States,"" the official said."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The foreign ministers of the Vatican and China met on Friday, the Vatican said, in what is believed to be the highest-level official encounter between the two sides in decades.
The meeting between Archbishop Paul Gallagher and Wang Yi, something unthinkable in the past, took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
They discussed the landmark 2018 deal between Rome and Beijing giving the Vatican the final say on the appointment of bishops, a matter that had long been contentious, a Vatican statement said.
It said the two sides agreed to continue ""institutional, bi-lateral dialogue"" aimed at benefiting both the Catholic Church and the Chinese people.
Relations between the Vatican and Beijing have improved since the 2018 deal. Conservative Catholics objected to the pact, accusing the Vatican of having sold out to the communist government.
Catholics in China are emerging from more than half a century of division which saw them split between a state-backed ""official"" Church and a ""non-official"" underground Church that remained loyal to Rome.
Both sides now recognize the pope as supreme leader of the Catholic Church.
The deal's most outspoken critic has been Cardinal Joseph Zen, the former archbishop of Hong Kong. The Vatican says no deal would have risked causing a schism.
Friday's meeting was the latest in a series of signs of improving relations in recent weeks.
Last month, the pope praised what he called China's ""great commitment"" to contain the coronavirus outbreak and later the Vatican's charity arm sent hundreds of thousands of medical masks to China as a goodwill gesture.
Many see the 2018 deal on the naming of bishops as a precursor to re-establishing diplomatic relations between the Vatican and Beijing after a rupture of more than 70 years.
If they resume full relations, the Vatican would have to break full relations with Taiwan, which Beijing considers a wayward province. The Vatican is the only state in Europe to still recognize Taipei."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike that killed a top Iranian military commander last month in response to past attacks, the White House said in a memo released on Friday, despite previous administration assertions that it was due to an imminent threat.
As required by law, the administration sent Congress an unclassified justification for the strike on Jan. 2 that killed Qassem Soleimani at the airport in Baghdad. The strike, and Iran's retaliation, raised fears of wider war and frustrated some lawmakers who said Trump had given them shifting justifications for the attack.
""The President directed this action in response to an escalating series of attacks in preceding months by Iran and Iran-backed militias on U.S. forces and interests in the Middle East region,"" the report to Congress said.
The House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee released the memo a day after the U.S. Senate, in a rebuke to Trump, passed legislation with rare bipartisan support to limit the president's ability to wage war against Iran.
The report said the purposes of the action were to protect U.S. personnel, deter Iran, degrade Iranian-backed militias' ability to conduct attacks and ""end Iran's strategic escalation of attacks.""
It also said the U.S. constitution gives the president the right to direct the use of force to protect the country from an attack or threat or imminent attack.
And it said an Authorization for the Use of Military Force that Congress passed in 2002, for the Iraq War, also applied.
Democratic Representative Eliot Engel, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the memo contradicted Trump's previous assertion that the strike prevented an imminent attack and said lawmakers needed more answers.

A committee aide confirmed that Pompeo had agreed to appear on Feb. 28. The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - English champions Manchester City have been banned from European competition for the next two seasons and fined 30 million euros ($32.53 million) by European soccer's governing body UEFA after an investigation into alleged breaches of Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules.
UEFA said in a statement https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/about-uefa/news/newsid=2638659.html that City had committed ""serious breaches"" of the rules while the Premier League club swiftly said on their website https://www.mancity.com/news/club-news/club-news/2020/february/manchester-city-club-statement that they will appeal the decision to the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
The ruling, if upheld, would mean Pep Guardiola's side would not be able to compete in the 2020-21 Champions League should they again qualify for Europe's top club competition. They would also be banned from European competition in the 2021-22 season.
An absence from continental action would have a significant impact on the club's revenue as well as their prestige.
UEFA's FFP rules are designed to prevent clubs receiving unlimited amounts of money through inflated sponsorship deals with organisations related to the owners.
The Adjudicatory Chamber of UEFA's Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) said City had broken the rules by ""overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even information submitted to UEFA between 2012 and 2016"" and added that the club ""failed to cooperate in the investigation"".
But City, who have denied any wrongdoing, said in a strongly worded response that they will fight the decision.
""Simply put, this is a case initiated by UEFA, prosecuted by UEFA and judged by UEFA. With this prejudicial process now over, the Club will pursue an impartial judgment as quickly as possible and will therefore, in the first instance, commence proceedings with the Court of Arbitration for Sport at the earliest opportunity,"" the club said.
INVESTIGATION PROCESS
Describing themselves as ""disappointed but not surprised"" by the decision, City took aim at the investigation process.
""In December 2018, the UEFA Chief Investigator publicly previewed the outcome and sanction he intended to be delivered to Manchester City, before any investigation had even begun.
""The subsequent flawed and consistently leaked UEFA process he oversaw has meant that there was little doubt in the result that he would deliver. The Club has formally complained to the UEFA Disciplinary body, a complaint which was validated by a CAS ruling.""
City are currently second in the Premier League and face Real Madrid in the last 16 of this season's Champions League.
UEFA had opened an investigation into City in March 2019 after German publication Der Spiegel alleged that the club’s Abu Dhabi owners had inflated sponsorship agreements to comply with FFP requirements.
The Abu Dhabi United Group, the investment vehicle owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is the majority owner of the City Football Group, with a stake of around 77%.
The City Football Group includes the Manchester club and owns or part-owns New York City FC, Melbourne City FC, Yokohama F. Marinos in Japan, Club Atletico Torque in Uruguay, Girona FC in Spain and Sichuan Jiuniu FC in China."
980,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 03:25PM ET</span>",Spanish court ruling citing gender equality helps woman retire early,"MADRID (Reuters) - A Spaniard has won a legal battle to include in her work record the time she spent attending a social program for women that was created in the Franco era, enabling her to qualify for early retirement after a ruling based on gender equality.
The woman had found herself seven days short of the minimum time spent working to qualify for early retirement because she was unable to include the period spent on the program created in 1937 to help women learn social and labor skills.
Her request to retire early was turned down by the National Social Security Institute and the decision was upheld by Catalonia's top regional court.
But Spain's Supreme Court overruled that decision on Friday, and said its ruling was based on gender equality - labor law already gave men the right in similar cases to include time spent doing military service or a substitute program.
The Women's Social Service program, for women aged from 17 to 35, was established by General General Francisco Franco's fascist organization during the Spanish civil war.
It was not abolished until 1978, five years after Franco died in power, leaving a nationalist legacy that still divides Spain and looms large over its political system.
The program was not compulsory for women but it was obligatory for those who wanted to work in public administration."
981,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 03:01PM ET</span>",No investigations of ousted White House aide Vindman: U.S. Army secretary,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said on Friday there were no investigations into Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, the former National Security Council aide who testified in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial and was fired by the White House along with his twin brother.
On Tuesday, Trump said the military may consider disciplining Vindman, who provided some of the most damaging testimony during an investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives of Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
""There's no investigations of him,"" McCarthy said during an event at the National Press Club. 
Vindman is back at the Army and will be heading to a military college in the summer. 
Vindman was escorted from the White House last week as was his twin brother, Yevgeny, who worked as a lawyer at the NSC and is also a lieutenant colonel.
""We sent him on his way to a much different location and the military can handle him any way they want,"" Trump said.
Asked if he was suggesting that Vindman face disciplinary action, Trump said that would be up to the military.
""If you look at what happened ... they're going to certainly, I would imagine, take a look at that,"" Trump said.
Vindman, then the NSC's top Ukraine expert, testified that Trump’s request for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential Democratic political rival in the 2020 presidential election, and his son Hunter during a July phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was improper.
The call led to the Republican president being impeached in the Democratic-controlled House and later acquitted in the Republican-majority Senate.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who was formerly the army secretary until taking the top Pentagon post, said in November that Vindman should not fear retaliation over his testimony.

Lu Jing, 56, was the second Chinese national to be arrested for trespassing last year at the resort where Trump often visits.
Her prosecution was left to local rather than federal authorities, as the president was not present on Dec. 18 when she entered the property and began taking pictures.
A jury on Wednesday cleared Lu of trespassing but convicted her of misdemeanor resisting arrest after police said she balled her hands into fists, crossed her arms and screamed ""no, no, no"" upon being arrested.
Palm Beach County Judge Mark Eissey imposed the six-month sentence despite defense claims that Lu was a merely a tourist who made an ""an honest mistake"" and was a casualty of the language barrier. Prosecutors contended Lu had made a ""calculated decision.""
""I'm a law-abiding citizen,"" Lu told the judge through a Mandarin interpreter at her sentencing hearing, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. ""I'm an ordinary Chinese woman. I never thought I would end up in jail.""
In March of last year, another Chinese national, Yujing Zhang, passed an initial Secret Service checkpoint by passing herself off as a relative of a resort member.
Zhang, 33, was found guilty in U.S. district court of lying to a federal officer and trespassing and sentenced to eight months in prison.
That incident raised fears Zhang could have posed an intelligence threat, but U.S. experts told Reuters it was hard to believe she was a professional spy.
Lu, whose visa had expired, remained in custody pending trial and could be subject to deportation after leaving jail.
During the trial she testified that while on vacation she hired a private tour guide who showed her sites including the president's resort, the Palm Beach Post reported. She said she walked onto the property and began taking cellphone pictures.
A security guard told the jury he tried to tell her she was not allowed and resorted to hand signals upon realizing she did not speak English, the Post said.
She left but then came back onto the property through another entrance, he said.
Lu testified that after leaving she continued on her sightseeing tour. Town police officers later arrested her in the Palm Beach shopping district."

Australia signed a production contract with Naval Group in February 2019 for a fleet of 12 attack-class submarines, ending a two-year wrangle over one of the world's most lucrative defense deals.
Australia had selected the French firm as its preferred bidder in 2016 ahead of other offers from Japan and Germany. However, final contracts were delayed amid reports of cost blowouts and production delays.
The project was again under scrutiny this week when Naval Group's Australia boss John Davis told The Australian newspaper he had concerns over the capability of local contractors, and suggested Australian businesses could fail to secure half of the value of the total contracts.
Those comments were met with anger by Australian Defence Minister Linda Reynolds, who said in a statement she would hold ""Naval Group to account for the commitments they signed on for"".
Reynolds met with France's Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday to discuss the spat.
The two said in a joint statement they had reaffirmed their full commitment toward the program, its calendar and the ramping up of Australian industrial capacity.
""We agreed on a follow-up process at our level for the implementation of the program on a quarterly basis this year with a meeting in France in April and another in Australia in mid-year,"" the two said.
Australia’s 12 new submarines are at the center of its plan to significantly expand its military to protect strategic and trade interests in the Asia-Pacific region. The first of the new submarines is scheduled to be delivered in the early 2030s and the final vessel during the 2050s.
An official aware of the issue said the project was still in its early stages and it was strange to make an assessment on local firms.
""There is nothing to suggest Australian partners can't do this and work is being done to help them. Everything is being done so that the a large part of the engineering is done in Australia,"" the official said.

""Peace is made ONLY with defeated enemies,"" said the billboards, which showed photo-shopped images of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, blindfolded and supplicating in a war-zone as helicopters hover.
Israel's stand-off with the Palestinians has grown newly tense since last month's unveiling of U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan, which they rejected as biased.
It was not immediately clear who sponsored the billboards around Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial capital, or if the campaign was meant to help rightist parties in a March 2 national election.
Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai said in a statement that the billboards would be removed, saying that their image ""incites violence and recalls the actions of ISIS and the Nazis - whom we do not want to counted among"".
""Even in election season, there are red lines,"" he said."

A government statement did not say who carried out the attack on Friday morning on Ogossagou, a village of Fulani herders in central Mali. Moulaye Guindo, mayor of the nearby town of Bankass, said at least 20 people had been killed.
In the attack on Ogossagou last March, suspected militiamen from a rival group killed more than 150 civilians, part of spiraling ethnic and jihadi violence in West Africa's vast Sahel region.
""They came and shot everything that moved,"" said Hamadou Dicko from Fulani association Tabital Pulaaku, who put the death toll at 22 minimum.
Guindo and another local official, who declined to be named, said Ogossagou had come under attack less than 24 hours after Malian troops who had been stationed near Ogossagou left their base.
An army spokesman said soldiers had been deployed to respond to the attack but declined to comment on whether they had previously left the local base.
Central Malian residents have criticized the army for failing to protect them against violence that has displaced 200,000 people and left many communities with no local government or means of defense.
They have turned to self-defense militias for protection against jihadists and rival ethnic groups though the defense groups have also used their weapons to settle scores.
Malian officials have said they suspect Dan Na Ambassagou, an anti-jihadi, ethnic Dogon group of carrying out last year's massacre in Ogossagou. The group denies responsibility.
French forces intervened in 2013 to drive back al Qaeda-linked jihadists who had seized northern Mali the previous year, but the militants have regrouped, stoking ethnic rivalries in central Mali and elsewhere to boost recruitment and destabilize the region."

""The promise I made to Canadians was to find answers for them and ensure that Iran leads a full investigation with the international community ... and holds to account the people responsible for this and that is my focus,"" Trudeau told reporters after meeting Mohammad Javad Zarif earlier on Friday.
Iran has rejected Trudeau's call to send the ""black box"" flight recorders from the plane abroad to be decoded. Trudeau said he had repeated that demand on Friday.
Many of the 176 who perished in the disaster were Iranians with dual citizenship, which is not recognized by Iran. Canada had 57 citizens on board.
Zarif said on Feb. 11 that Canada's complaint about the plane that was mistakenly shot down by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in January had no legal basis.
Canadian lawyers, who previously successfully sued Iran, are seeking class action status in a lawsuit on behalf of relatives of victims aboard the plane, looking for at least C$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) in compensation.

Trudeau added that he wanted to draw up something positive from the tragedy by working toward the implementation of international frameworks to prevent passenger aircraft flying near conflict zones.

The speech by Hariri, the country's top Sunni Muslim politician, laid bare growing political divisions that could complicate Beirut's push to enact painful reforms and recover from the worst economic crisis since its 1975-1990 war.
A cabinet formed last month by the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies, the first since Hariri resigned in October in the face of protests, must contend with a severe liquidity crunch and fast-approaching debt payments, with a $1.2 billion Eurobond due on March 9.
The government clinched a parliamentary vote of confidence on Tuesday but several major parties, such as Hariri's Future Movement, the Christian Lebanese Forces and Kataeb parties, and the Druze Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Socialist Party, all withheld support.
Speaking on the 15th anniversary of the assassination of his father, ex-premier Rafik al-Hariri, Hariri lambasted his rivals, casting their obstruction of reforms as largely to blame for the depth of the current crisis.
""We organized the Cedar conference, and we got $11 billion dollars for the economy based on reforms we agreed to and promised to implement,"" said Hariri, referring to a 2018 Paris donor conference. ""But what can I do if someone does not keep to his word?""
Hariri, an ally of Western and Gulf Arab states at odds with Iran, threw his most scathing jabs at former Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, the son-in-law of President Michel Aoun, who he called a ""shadow"" president who had subverted his work and helped push the country to collapse.
The remarks underscored the end of a fragile cross-sectarian alliance that had held between Hariri, Aoun's Christian Free Patriotic Movement and Hezbollah, a coalition that formed the basis of two previous governments.
In his speech Hariri raised prickly questions about how the new cabinet, seen as dominated by Hezbollah, could win the badly needed support of countries at odds with Iran, another potential obstacle to its recovery bid.
""Can we establish tourism without Arab and Gulf citizens? Can we open markets for Lebanese goods without having Arab and Gulf markets in particular?"" said Hariri.
""Iran's cash can solve the problems of a party, but not a country's,"" said Hariri, in a pointed reference to Hezbollah."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Dozens of activists flocked to Mexico's presidential palace on Friday to protest violence against women, chanting ""not one murder more"" and splashing one of its large, ornate doors with blood-red paint and the words ""femicide state.""
The heated Valentine's Day demonstration, led by women, stemmed from outrage in recent days over the killing of 25-year-old Ingrid Escamilla in Mexico City and the publication of graphic photos of her mutilated corpse in newspapers.
One protester spray-painted ""INGRID"" in tall pink letters on another palace door in tribute. Many participants noted that her death was only the latest example in a wave of brutal murders of women that have been dubbed ""femicides.""
An average of 10 women are killed a day in Mexico, and last year marked a new overall homicide record, official data shows.
""It's not just Ingrid. There are thousands of femicides,"" said Lilia Florencio Guerrero, whose daughter was violently killed in 2017. ""It fills us with anger and rage.""
She called on President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who was inside the palace as the protests continued, to do more to stop the violence.
Others graffitied slogans including ""they are killing us"" on the building's walls and ejected bright flames from cans of flammable spray-paint.
Inside the stately palace, where Lopez Obrador lives with his family, the president attempted to reassure the activists during his morning news conference.
""I'm not burying my head in the sand... The government I represent will always take care of ensuring the safety of women,"" he said, without detailing new plans.
Protesters also admonished the newspapers that published photos of Escamilla's corpse, chanting, ""the press is complicit.""
La Prensa, a newspaper that ran the gruesome image on its cover, defended its record of reporting on crime and murder, subjects it said the government prefers to keep quiet. The paper also said it was open to discussion on adjusting its standards beyond legal requirements.
""We understand today that it hasn't been sufficient, and we've entered a process of deeper review,"" the paper said in a front-page statement on Friday.
Newspaper Pasala had filled nearly its entire tabloid cover with the photo, under the Valentine's Day-themed headline: ""It was cupid's fault."" The cover sparked anger not only at the gory display, but also the jocular tone over a crime for which Escamilla's domestic partner has been arrested.
Pasala editors did not respond to requests for comment."

""The allegations of gross human rights violations against Shavendra Silva, documented by the United Nations and other organizations, are serious and credible,"" Pompeo said in a statement.
U.S. sanctions imposed on Friday by Washington bar both Silva and his immediate family members from entering the United States.
Sri Lanka's Ministry of Foreign Relations called on Washington to review its decision and said there were ""no substantiated or proven allegations of human rights violations against him.""
""The Government of Sri Lanka takes strong objection to the imposition of travel restrictions on Lt. Gen. Silva and his immediate family members by the Government of the United States, based on independently unverified information,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Silva's appointment as army commander of the island nation in August drew sharp criticism from the United States and the United Nations, which later suspended the Sri Lankan army from its peacekeeping operations.
Silva led an army division against Tamil Tiger rebels in the final phases of Sri Lanka's 26-year-long civil war, which ended in 2009.
His victory, however, was highly controversial. Thousands of civilians were killed in the last phases of the conflict, including in areas declared by the government to be a ""no fire zone,"" which came under sustained army shelling, including hospitals.

A U.N. panel has accused Silva's division of suspected extrajudicial executions of unarmed rebels in the final week of the war and systematic torture of people in custody.

MUNICH (Reuters) - Germany's president took an indirect swipe at U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday in accusing Washington, China and Russia of stoking global mistrust and insecurity with a ""great powers"" competition"" that could threaten a new nuclear arms race.
In opening remarks at the annual Munich Security Conference, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier deplored the three big powers' approach to global affairs and, without naming Trump, took issue with his vow to ""make America great again"".
""'Great again' - even at the expense of neighbors and partners,"" quipped Steinmeier, a former Social Democrat foreign minister whose comments on foreign policy carry authority.
As foreign minister in 2014, he was central to the so-called ""Munich consensus"" when German leaders said Berlin was ready to assume more responsibility in global affairs. Steinmeier pressed that point again on Friday, but not before bemoaning the foreign policy approaches of Russia, China and the United States.
""Russia...has made military force and the violent shifting of borders on the European continent the means of politics once again,"" he said in the text of a speech for delivery at the opening of the conference.
""China...accepts international law only selectively where it does not run counter to its own interests,"" Steinmeier said. ""And our closest ally, the United States of America, under the present administration itself, rejects the idea of an international community.""
The upshot was ""more mistrust, more armament, less security...all the way to a new nuclear arms race,"" he said.
In response, he said, Germany should raise defense spending to contribute more to European security and to maintain its alliance with the United States, recognizing that U.S. interests were gravitating away from Europe toward Asia.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas later said: ""Germany is prepared to become more involved, including militarily.
""But let us not narrow the discussion down to a single question. The strength of our alliance is not measured in euros or dollars alone,"" he added, responding to U.S. pressure on Germany to increase its defense spending.
""Relentless discussion, not maximum disruption, brings good results,"" he said, adding of NATO: ""Only together do we have the economic strength, the military potential and the ideas of political order needed to defend the rule-based world order.""
Steinmeier called for a European policy toward Russia ""that is not limited to condemning statements and sanctions alone"". 

Europe, he added, ""must find its own balance with China between intensifying competition between systems and the need for cooperation.""

The official told reporters at a security conference in Munich the seven-day reduction of violence agreement had yet to begin.
The announcement followed a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani during the conference on Friday. It came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump said there was a ""good chance"" of reaching an agreement with the Taliban on a reduction of U.S. troops nearly two decades after the U.S.-led invasion.
An agreement that leads to a major U.S. troop withdrawal could be a political boost for Trump, who has repeatedly promised to stop ""endless wars"" as he seeks re-election in November.
The senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the reduction of violence agreement covers the entire country and also applies to Afghan forces, even though the Afghan government has been excluded from the talks between the United States and Taliban in Qatar.

""This was a very tragic incident,"" Institute for Social Welfare Director Arielle Jeanty Villedrouin told Reuters, saying the priority now was to find a new home for surviving children from the Orphanage of the Church of Bible Understanding on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital.
""We are going to place them in a transit center while we do research on their family and see if we can reunite them with their parents,"" she said.
She did not elaborate and the cause of the fire, as well as the exact number of victims, were not immediately clear.
Many of the children in the orphanages of the poorest nation in the Americas have living parents who gave them up because they were too impoverished to look after them.
Contacted for comment, a woman who answered the Church of Bible Understanding's local telephone number said: ""We will make it known when it is appropriate.""
She did not identify herself and hung up without saying anything further.
The group says on its website it started its first orphanage in Haiti nearly 40 years ago. It says its primary goal is ""to spread the Gospel to any and all who will receive it.""

KIEV (Reuters) - A group of three U.S. Senators visited Kiev on Friday to convey a message of continued bipartisan support for Ukraine after it got entangled last year in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.
The United States has been the most powerful backer of Ukraine in its standoff with Russia over Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea and support for separatist fighters in a simmering conflict in the eastern Donbass region.
But their relationship was tested after Trump froze nearly $400 million in security aid and pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate one of the Republican president's Democratic rivals, former vice president Joe Biden.
Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives but was acquitted this month in the Republican-led Senate. 
""I think we all are confident that President Zelenskiy does not want to be involved in U.S. politics, and we hope that any pressure (that) existed in the past to do so is over,"" Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said after meeting the Ukrainian leader.. 
""Our message is we want to put this impeachment question behind us, and we want to be moving together, Republicans and Democrats, in supporting Ukraine."" 
Murphy was accompanied to Kiev by Republican Senators Ron Johnson and John Barrasso. 
In a statement, posted on his office's website, Zelenskiy said he wanted to change Ukraine's global image so that people did not associate the country with corruption.
At the heart of the impeachment case was a transcript of a July 25 telephone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to work with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to investigate Biden. 
The fallout from the impeachment trial continued in Washington this week, as Trump said the military may consider disciplining former National Security Council aide Alexander Vindman, who testified in the case.
Asked if he regretted sending Giuliani to Ukraine last year, Trump said on Thursday in a radio interview: ""No, not at all."" He also defended engaging Giuliani, a former New York mayor.
""Rudy is a high-quality guy,"" he said in an interview that aired on iHeart Radio. 
Trump also said he may stop allowing government aides to listen in on his telephone calls with foreign leaders.

Barr this week acknowledged that the U.S. Department of Justice was accepting and reviewing information from Giuliani ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, sparking concern from Democrats and some legal experts.

ASUNCION (Reuters) - Paraguay health officials said on Friday that deaths from dengue fever increased to 16 in the South American country's worst outbreak of the disease in the last decade, severely straining its health system.
There are also 89 deaths under review to determine if they were caused by dengue. The death toll indicates a sharp increase from the previous week, when the Public Health Ministry registered six deaths from dengue with 50 other deaths under review since the start of the year.
The outbreak led the Senate to call for a 90-day health emergency, which is expected to be endorsed by the Chamber of Deputies on Monday. The government has said the emergency measure is not necessary and that it has adequate resources to cope.
Cases of dengue, a virus transmitted by mosquitoes, typically increase in the summer months between January and March, when mosquito activity is at a peak. Numbers of dengue cases tend to gradually decrease toward the end of March.
Health officials said there were 85,000 cases of dengue fever in Paraguay, up from 57,000 cases last week.
""We have an increase, but it has slowed down in the last two weeks of the epidemic,"" Public Health Minister Julio Mazzoleni told journalists.
""We have approached a point of stability and hope that from there we go quickly into a gradual decline,"" Mazzoleni added.
The Ministry said the number of cases in the first weeks of 2020 were the highest in the last decade.
The death toll, however, remains lower than the 250 from a 2013 epidemic.
Clinics in the capital city Asuncion, which has more than three quarters of the country's confirmed cases, are crowded with patients with high fevers and headaches, the main symptoms of dengue.

The family's encounter with the virus began when the parents of a 29-year-old Beijing man surnamed Liu, who are from central China's Hubei province, briefly stopped in Wuhan, the outbreak's epicentre, on their way to Beijing for the Lunar New Year.
The mother was diagnosed with coronavirus on Jan. 29, and her son and his wife and their one-year-old son were all subsequently found to have been infected with coronavirus.
""I was a little bit scared at the beginning, but the fears eased as medical workers took good care of us and encouraged us everyday,"" Liu's 31-year-old wife said during a group interview organized by the government at the Beijing YouAn Hospital, where the couple and their one-year-old son were all treated.
The family only provided surnames, and the grandmother's condition was not immediately available.
The coronavirus outbreak has killed 1,380 in China and infected more than 63,000 in the country.
The city of Beijing has reported 372 infections and three deaths as of Thursday. Of those infected, 79 had recovered and returned home as of Thursday, according to the Beijing Municipal Health Commission.
On Friday, the Liu family was among eight recovered coronavirus patients who left the YouAn hospital, headed for a few days of home quarantine.
According to the National Health Commission, the fatality rate for confirmed coronavirus cases in Hubei province was 3.1% as of Feb 3, and 0.16 percent in the rest of the country."

Alstom confirmed that Michele Viale, head of its Italian unit Alstom Ferroviaria, was among individuals being investigated over the incident on Feb. 6 that killed two train drivers and injured scores of passengers.
On Thursday the head of rail transport security agency ANSF told an Italian Senate hearing that prosecutors were looking into the possibility that faulty cabling in switching equipment supplied by Alstom may have been a factor in the accident.
ANSF has alerted other rail network operators to a possible malfunction in switching equipment supplied by the group.
Alstom said it is cooperating with investigators. ""We are mobilizing all our resources to provide the support that has been requested,"" it said in a statement.
Viale was not reachable for immediate comment.
The accident happened in the early hours of Feb. 6 when a high-speed Frecciarossa train skipped the tracks while traveling at an estimated 280 kph (175 mph). The front engine jumping onto an adjacent track and smashing into idle freight wagons before coming to a stop several hundred meters away.
Officials said immediately following the accident that maintenance had been carried out on the line overnight and investigators were looking to see if this work might have caused the disaster."

LONDON (Reuters) - When Victoria Beckham sends her models down the London catwalk on Sunday, many of her most important clients will not be sitting in the front row but following from afar as the coronavirus outbreak hobbles international events.
The drive by London Fashion Week to communicate with absent Chinese buyers is just one of the ways the global events industry is adapting, quickly, to keep the show on the road.
Caroline Rush, head of the British Fashion Council, said it wanted to keep dialogue open and buyers engaged.
""Through the platforms that we've put in place, we know that is possible,"" she told Reuters. ""It will be promoted through Weibo and WeChat and all of the social media channels as well as media platforms and partners that we work with in China.""
The disruption is more serious for others, with dozens of large trade fairs and industry conferences postponed in Asia after airlines cancelled flights and companies curbed travel.
Events due to be held as late as the end of March have already been rescheduled, while the venue of China's oldest and biggest trade fair, the Canton Fair, has suspended events until further notice. It was due to hold its spring exhibition from April 15, an event that led last year to some $30 billion worth of deals being signed.
In Barcelona, the world's biggest telecoms conference, Mobile World Congress (MWC), was called off this week.
With more than 100,000 attendees due to be mingling inside the halls, restaurants and conference rooms of the Fira de Barcelona, operators like  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) and tech groups such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) felt they could not risk attending.
By Friday 1,380 people had died of the new coronavirus, with 63,851 infected, the majority of which were in China.
RESILIENCE
While cancellations will undoubtedly hit short-term economic output, the global exhibitions and events industry has proved to be remarkably resilient in the face of previous challenges such as SARS, the global financial crisis and the ash cloud that disrupted flights in 2010.
Figures from management consultancy JWC show industry turnover rose steadily after the financial crash, but much of that growth came from China, soon to be home to the world's biggest exhibition centre in Shenzhen.
""The industry has shown time and again that when there is a disruption, you may have an event being cancelled...but usually that leads to a bounce back effect the year after,"" said Kai Hattendorf, chief executive of the Global Association of the Exhibition Industry.
Mats Granryd, director general of the GSMA which organises MWC, concurred.
""(MWC) is the place where business takes place, and that is not going to go away any time soon,"" he said.
However, the blow was particularly tough for smaller companies, many of which sink their entire annual marketing budget into making a success of the trade fair.
When a major event such as the financial crash forces companies to reduce the number of staff they send to a trade fair, the hunt for sales generally means they still attend in some form. And when tougher times force a sector's third or fourth biggest event out of business, it often makes the leading shows even more important.
""If you are running a global platform people will travel a long distance, across many time zones, to attend,"" Hattendorf said.
MOVING ONLINE?
Worth an estimated $325 billion in business sales a year, the global events and exhibitions industry has adapted as the economy evolves.
Where Relx, the world's second largest exhibitions provider behind Britain's Informa, once held a large computer hardware show, it now hosts events on rechargeable batteries in Japan, waste technology in Russia and Infosecurity in Mexico.
And for years now the industry has faced talk of whether shows and trade fairs will move online - both Sony and Nokia (HE:NOKIA) said they would hold digital product launches when they pulled out of Mobile World Congress.
Holding so-called virtual exhibitions would enable attendees to cut back on spending and travel, an issue that is becoming more important as companies and consumers rein in flying, in part due to environmental concerns.
""Over the last 10, 20 years there have been dramatic developments in how people interact, whether they do that online, by video,"" Relx Finance Director Nick Luff told reporters. ""But face to face remains a very important part for many industries.""
Many shows now broadcast core presentations and speeches online as well, widening the potential audience and building new revenue streams.
According to a 2019 report for industry body UFI, there was 138 million square meters of exhibitor stands across the world, with 303 million people attending exhibitions.
The British Fashion Council's Rush said she had faced questions around the long-term viability of London Fashion Week ever since it started streaming some shows back in 2009.
""I think there is something around fashion week, around seeing the fabric, touching and feeling it, and the convening of people and the discussion that happens around it, that sort of community network is hard to recreate online,"" she said."

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday there was a ""good chance"" of reaching an agreement with the Taliban on a reduction of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said an important breakthrough had been made in peace talks with the Taliban in recent days, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper said they had negotiated a proposal for a week-long reduction in violence.
But on Friday a vehicle carrying civilians was targeted in an air strike in the eastern province of Nangarhar, according to residents, who added that among the eight killed was a child. Taliban insurgents have a strong presence in the region.
A spokesman for the provincial governor of Nangarhar confirmed the incident but did not say who the victims were.
Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said 11 civilians were killed in the incident.
Afghan, Taliban and U.S. sources said over the last 48 hours that a deal to curb violence was on the verge of implementation. Details about when that was set to begin were not immediately clear but a Taliban official said it would be this week.
While U.S. and Taliban negotiators pressed on with meetings in Doha, Qatar, the Taliban and the Afghan government also reported fighting on the ground over the last 24 hours.
An air strike on Thursday evening killed a senior Taliban commander and eight others in northern Balkh province, the Afghan defense ministry said.
The Taliban's Mujahid said the insurgents had killed six Afghan soldiers, including two officers, in an attack on a checkpoint in northern Kunduz province."

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenian President Borut Pahor will hold more talks with political parties on Feb. 24 and 25 to try to form a new government following the resignation of the center-left Prime Minister Marjan Sarec in January.
Sarec, whose government only held 43 seats in the 90-seat parliament, resigned saying he did not have sufficient support to enforce important legislation.
Pahor has until Feb. 28 to nominate a candidate for a new prime minister or tell parliament he will nominate no one, in which case members of parliament have 16 days to nominate their own candidates. If no one is nominated or gets majority support, Pahor would have to call a new election.
The main tasks of a new government would include improving the inefficient national health system, reducing the pressure of the rapidly aging population on the budget, and holding the European Union presidency in the second half of 2021.
On Thursday former Prime Minister Janez Jansa, who leads the largest party, the center-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), told reporters he was confident he could get majority support in parliament to become prime minister again.
Jansa's SDS last week started coalition talks with the center-left Party of Modern Center, the conservative New Slovenia and pensioners' party Desus. The four parties together would have a comfortable majority of 48 seats."

""We will not stop,"" chanted a crowd in the center of the capital Algiers, despite a large police presence. 
Over the past year the protesters have changed the face of Algeria's power structure, causing the fall of a veteran president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and the arrest of dozens of leading figures including a once untouchable former intelligence chief.
However, while the new president has released people detained in the protests, set up a commission to amend the constitution and offered talks to the opposition, much of the old ruling elite remains in place. 
The leaderless protest movement, known as ""hirak"", is demanding more concessions, including the release of more activists and the departure of more senior figures from positions of power. 
""Our hirak is tireless. We are ready to keep marching for months more,"" said Yazid Chabi, a 23-year-old student on the central Didouche Mourad street in central Algiers. 
However, since December's presidential election the number of protesters has fallen according to people attending the marches each week.
Hirak opposed the election, regarding as illegitimate any vote that took place while the old ruling elite was in power and while the military was involved in politics. 
Abdelmadjid Tebboune, a former prime minister seen by the protesters as part of the old elite, was elected, but turnout was only 40% according to official statistics. 
Even without the political unrest, his new government now faces a difficult economic year with energy revenues rapidly sinking, hitting state finances hard. 
Chabi, who is studying law, said he has no expectation of finding work after he graduates. ""Algerians have been getting only promises. Nothing has improved in recent years because corruption is still there,"" he said.
Two former prime ministers, several ex-ministers and prominent businessmen have been jailed after anti-graft investigations that followed protests demanding the prosecution of people involved in corruption.
Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad this week said corruption and mismanagement resulted in a ""delicate"" economic situation for Algeria, an OPEC member country that is also facing a negative impact from falling global crude oil prices.

Russia labeled the Jehovah's Witnesses an extremist organization in 2017 and ordered it to disband. Since then a crackdown has seen dozens of adherents detained and hundreds hit with criminal charges.
Law enforcement officers in the city of Chita, six time zones east of Moscow, put a bag over Vadim Kutsenko's head, drove him to a wooded area where they beat his head and legs, put him in a chokehold and used a taser on him, lawyer Artur Ganin said.
The National Guard and police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The alleged incident occurred on Monday after police searched nearly 40 homes of Jehavoh's Witnesses including that of Kutsenko whom they detained and then released after questioning him.
The officers, who were dressed in plain clothes, detained Kutsenko again later at his mother-in-law's house. They threatened him and told him to confess and to disclose information about other Jehovah's Witnesses, Ganin told Reuters.
After he refused to confess or divulge information, Kutsenko was taken to an investigator's office where the officers who detained him identified themselves as members of the Russian National Guard, Ganin said.
Kutsenko, who is being held in police custody pending a court hearing, is suspected of helping to organize the Jehovah's Witnesses' activities in Chita."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Villagers along the Mekong River have asked a court in Bangkok on Friday to slow down Thai purchases of electricity from a hydropower dam in Laos, which they say has harmed their livelihoods since it began operation last year.
The 1,285-megawatt Xayaburi Dam, financed by Thai companies and banks, is the first hydropower dam on the lower Mekong River in Laos and sells 90% of its power to Thailand. The start of its full commercial operation last year coincided with parts of the Mekong River drying to a trickle.
""We want a temporary measure to decelerate the purchasing of electricity in the initial agreement. We believe that if the buying is slowed down, then the power production would halt,"" Rattanamanee Polkla, a lawyer representing the Mekong community told reporters.
""We can then take a look at the impact and conduct studies on how to mitigate them if power generation resumes,"" she said.
Officials from the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) said that the state-owned company will continue to buy electricity from the Xayaburi Dam as long as there is no court order against it.
The same group of villagers took EGAT to court before in 2012, claiming that the construction of the Xayaburi Dam would damage the river's ecosystem and therefore their livelihoods, but the court dismissed the complaint in 2016.
The villagers also on Friday lodged an official appeal to the 2016 court's decision and said new evidence has emerged since the dam began full commercial operations last year.
""The concerns we raised eight years ago are now apparent,"" Ormbun Thipsuna, a representative of the Mekong community in Thailand said.
""Whether the changes in the tide, the extra-dry conditions, the unusual daily fluctuation of the river and the missing sediment, these impacts are very clear,"" she said."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Strains between Turkey and Russia over the escalating Syrian offensive in Idlib appear not to have shaken Turkish plans to deploy Russian missile defense systems, a senior U.S. official said on Friday, despite a threat of U.S sanctions.
The fighting in the northwestern Syrian province has led to testy exchanges between Russia, which supports the offensive by Syrian troops, and Turkey which has deployed thousands of its own soldiers to support insurgents trying to halt the advance.
Last week President Tayyip Erdogan angrily told Russia to ""step aside"" and let Turkey retaliate after a number of Turkish troops were killed. Both countries have accused each other of flouting accords aimed at containing the conflict.
The falling-out has offered the United States a rare opportunity to highlight its common ground with NATO partner Turkey, after years of worsening relations which could deteriorate further if Turkey goes ahead with plans to activate the Russian S-400 missile system in coming months.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted support for Turkey. Special envoy James Jeffrey, speaking in Turkish in the capital Ankara, referred to the fallen Turkish soldiers as ""martyrs"".
Turkey was defending its interests in Idlib ""in a manner that is appropriate and one that the United States supports,"" the senior U.S. State Department official, who spoke on condition he was not further identified, told reporters.
Washington has also sought to emphasize Moscow and Ankara's divergent goals - not just in Syria but also in the Libyan conflict, where the two countries also support opposing sides.
""What we are seeing in Syria and Libya in particular is demonstrative of the way in which Turkish and Russian interests do not overlap,"" he said. ""I'm hopeful that our Turkish partners will take that message away from this.""
TURKEY'S COURSE ""IS SET""
The official, speaking after talks in Turkey, said Russia's ""destructive role"" was having an impact on Turkish authorities, but had not led to a change of policy on the S-400s.
""I have not seen that translate into a rethink of Turkey's position specific to the S-400s. It is my expectation that Turkey's course on this is set,"" he said.
Turkey took delivery of a first batch of the S-400 missile defense batteries last July and has said it plans to activate them in April. Washington says they are incompatible with NATO defenses and has halted Turkey's purchase of F-35 stealth fighter jets, which it says would be compromised by the S-400s.
The dispute, which could trigger U.S. sanctions on Turkey, is one of several disagreements which have soured relations including a U.S. conviction of a Turkish bank executive for evading U.S. sanctions on Iran and Washington's support for Kurdish YPG fighters in northeast Syria.
Until the latest escalation of fighting in Idlib, Turkish and Russian troops had carried out regular joint patrols in northeast Syria as part of an accord between Ankara and Moscow under which YPG fighters withdrew from the border.
A Turkish security source said a planned patrol last week had been postponed because of ""harsh weather"", but the U.S. official said the Idlib dispute could be having an impact.
""I assess that that is spilling over into Turkish-Russian cooperation in the northeast as well. The one has to complicate the other. You cannot isolate them."""

The other eight men were detained on suspicion of supporting the organization with money and weapons, the GBA said.
The suspects wanted their attacks to create havoc and an atmosphere of fear that resembles a civil war, it added.
""The goal of the organization was to shake and eventually destroy the democratic system and social cohesion of the federal republic,"" the GBA said. ""For the purpose of creating an conditions that resemble a civil war, attacks that were not yet concrete against politicians, asylum seekers and members of the Muslim faith were planned.""

Harry Miller posted 31 ""gender critical"" tweets between November 2018 and January 2019 which were reported to police by a transgender woman, referred to as Mrs B, who said they were ""brazen transphobic comments"".
In one message Miller, a former police office himself, wrote: ""I was assigned mammal at birth, but my orientation is fish. Don't mis-species me"", and in another he said: ""You know the worst thing about cancer? It's transphobic.""
He also made references to the Olympic success of Caitlyn Jenner, America’s best-known transgender celebrity who announced her transition from gold medalist Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn in 2015.
Police categorized Mrs B's complaint as a ‘non-crime hate incident’ and an officer visited Miller's workplace. In a later phone call, the officer left him with the impression that he could face criminal prosecution if he continued to tweet. 
Miller took legal action against the local police force and on Friday judge Julian Knowles at London's High Court upheld his claim, ruling the tweets were lawful and that police had disproportionately interfered with his right of freedom of expression.
""In this country we have never had a Cheka, a Gestapo or a Stasi,"" the judge said. ""We have never lived in an Orwellian society.""
However, he rejected Miller's complaint about the College of Policing's wider guidance on hate crimes, saying it served legitimate purposes.
Miller, who works in a plant and machinery company in eastern England, denied that he was prejudiced against transgender people, saying his position was ""accurately described as gender-critical"".
""I want to raise awareness by stating that which used to be instinctively obvious – a biological man is a man and a biological woman is a woman. To claim otherwise is extraordinary,"" he said in a statement to the court.
After the ruling, he said the judge's decision had sent a message to police about how they should treat such cases.

A rebel military source and eyewitnesses told Reuters Russian jets had been targeting areas in the countryside west of Aleppo earlier on Friday, but they evacuated back to the city after the helicopter was downed.
""One of our military helicopters was hit by an enemy missile in the western countryside of Aleppo...where armed terrorist organizations supported by Turkey are deployed, and this led to the fall of the helicopter and death of its crew,"" Syrian state news agency SANA cited a military source as saying.
Turkey's military has sent additional arms and troops to Idlib, on its southern border, to confront a push by Russia-backed Syrian government forces to retake the country's last major rebel stronghold after nearly nine years of war.
The Syrian Observatory war monitor said on Friday that Turkey had deployed around 6,500 soldiers to reinforce existing units in northwest Syria, as well as some 1,900 military vehicles since early February. 
The helicopter was struck as it flew over the front lines after leaving Aleppo, which is controlled by the government, Turkish state-owned Anadolu news agency said. Rebels downed another government helicopter on Tuesday near the town of Nairab, to the south.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - An Istanbul court acquitted novelist Asli Erdogan on Friday of charges of terrorist group membership, in one of a series cases which have fueled concern among European Union states and rights groups about a deterioration in media freedom in Turkey.
Erdogan, who is now living in self-imposed exile in Europe, was one of some two dozen staff from the pro-Kurdish Ozgur Gundem newspaper who were detained in 2016 as part of an investigation into their alleged links to Kurdish militants.
The court also acquitted her of ""undermining national unity"", while charges of spreading terrorist propaganda were dropped.
Two of her colleagues were acquitted of the three charges, while the cases of six others were separated. The court did not set a date for the next session of their trial.
Erdogan had faced a sentence of up to nine years and four months in jail if found guilty, although she has lived largely abroad since a travel ban was lifted against her in 2017. She is not related to President Tayyip Erdogan.
At the time of her arrest, a court closed the newspaper on grounds of spreading propaganda of the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), deemed a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and European Union.
The paper was among more than 130 media outlets which Turkey closed during a state of emergency declared following a failed military coup in July 2016 in a crackdown which alarmed Ankara's Western allies and rights groups.
Ozgur Gundem had focused on the PKK conflict in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast and had faced many investigations, fines and the arrest of correspondents in the years before it was closed.

The PKK took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

The decision followed a warning by Taiwan, which has only reported 18 cases of the virus compared to more then 63,000 in China, of possible retaliation against the ban.
Taiwan had complained the ban was due to the World Health Organization. The WHO considers self-ruled Taiwan a part of China, listing the island under China for virus case numbers, which Taiwan said gave a misleading impression that it had the same rampant outbreak of the disease as China.
Curbs imposed on Taiwan were removed effective immediately, and its people are again free to travel to and from the Philippines, Salvador Panelo, spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said in a statement.
""The lifting of travel restrictions for Taiwan has been agreed by the members of the Inter-Agency Task Force by reason of the strict measures (against the virus) they are undertaking,"" Panelo said.
The decision was first confirmed to Reuters by a senior government official, who asked not to be identified prior to the signing of the order. Safeguards will be put in place, including ""heightened standard precautionary measures"" and port-of-exit screening, the official said.
The Philippines health and tourism ministers confirmed the order's signing and said safety protocols would be implemented.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry welcomed the news, saying the island had the virus situation well in hand.
The WHO needs to recognise that Taiwan does not come under China's remit, and make amends, it added.
The ministry said the WHO's mistaken designation of Taiwan and listing it as part of China's virus area had ""misled"" the international community, causing huge problems for Taiwan's government and people.
Taiwan and the Philippines have close economic ties and there are more than 115,000 Filipinos living and working in Taiwan, mainly in factories and as household helpers.
Taiwan is the Philippines' fifth largest tourist market, with 327,273 arrivals in January to November last year, up 35% versus the same period in 2018, tourism ministry data showed.
The coronavirus has killed more than 1,380 people, almost all in China where the outbreak originated, with one each in Hong Kong the Philippines and Japan.
The Philippines, which recorded the first fatality from the epidemic outside of China, imposed the travel ban on travellers from Taiwan on Monday. Taiwan appealed for its lifting.
Panelo said an inter-agency panel will evaluate other jurisdictions, including the Chinese territory of Macau, for release from the ban as well, Panelo said."

SEOUL (Reuters) - Wearing virtual reality goggles, Jang Ji-sung burst into tears as her 7-year-old daughter, Na-yeon, emerged from behind piles of wood in a neighborhood park, her playground until she died from blood-related diseases three years ago.
""Mom, where have you been? Have you been thinking of me?"" Na-yeon said, prompting a choked-up Jang to reply: ""Always.""
Jang tried to reach closer, only to see her hands penetrate the virtual figure wearing her daughter's favorite violet dress and carrying a pink purse featuring Elsa and Anna, sisters from Disney's animated musical ""Frozen"".
""I really want to touch you just once,"" Jang said, her voice and hands quivering. ""I really missed you.""
The tearful reunion, aired last week in a documentary by South Korean broadcaster MBC, was made possible by virtual reality (VR) technology which embodied Na-yeon in a digital avatar modeled upon a child actor using photos and memories from her mother.
The documentary, entitled ""Meeting You"", struck a chord with many South Koreans while highlighting the growing scope of the new technology beyond gaming.
""People would often think that technology is something that's cold. We decided to participate to see if technology can comfort and warm your heart when it is used for people,"" said Lee Hyun-suk, director of the Seoul-based VIVE Studios, who led the project.
Kim Jong-woo, who produced the documentary, said he focused on ""remembering"" Na-yeon instead of recreating her, so Jang and her family would feel as if her daughter had lived on.
For Jang, her last wish was to tell Na-yeon she loved her and has never forgotten her.
""It's heartbreaking that her time has stopped at the age of 7,"" Jang said, with a faint smile. ""But I was so happy to see her that way."""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - An Indian court on Friday ordered a state government to explain why police interrogated children who performed a play critical of a new law, a lawyer said, in a case that has raised questions about freedom of speech.
Parliament in December passed a law, championed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Hindu-nationalist party, aimed at facilitating citizenship for migrant members of non-Muslim religions from India's Muslim-majority neighbors.
Critics say the law violates India's secular constitution and discriminates against minority Muslims. At least 25 people have been killed in protests against it.
Students at a school in the southern state of Karnataka performed a satirical play on Jan. 21 in which reference were made to ""dictators"" and dialogue that suggested hitting Modi with a shoe, which is seen as particularly insulting.
Police, lawyers and school officials said that following a complaint from a member of the public, the headmistress of the school, Farida Begum, and the mother of one of the children who took part in the play were arrested on Jan. 30.
Police later questioned children as young as nine, some of them as many as five times, said Thouseef Madikeri, chief executive of a foundation that runs the Shaheen English Primary and High School, and Narayan Ganesh, a lawyer for the two accused women.
Karnataka's top court on Friday gave the state government, ruled by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), until next Wednesday to respond to a rights group's allegations that police illegally questioned the children, said Nayana Jhawar, a lawyer for the group.
A senior police official, Basweshwar H., said the incident was being investigated. He declined to comment further.
According to an initial police report, seen by Reuters, the complainant accused school officials of raising ""ill-will and fear among communities"" by staging the play.
The two women have been charged under a colonial-era sedition law that rights groups have long argued stifles freedom of expression.
""It's a silly case. Lampooning political leaders is not sedition,"" said Madikeri."

Helmut Oberlander, who was born in Ukraine and became a German citizen during World War Two, was stripped of his post-war Canadian citizenship when Ottawa learned of his wartime activities.
In December, Canada's Supreme Court rejected an appeal to restore his citizenship that he obtained in 1960.
Russia's Investigation Committee, which handles probes into serious crimes, said it wanted Canada's case and legal files on Oberlander and said it was checking his possible involvement in a massacre at an orphanage in the then-Soviet town of Yeysk.
In a statement, the committee said a death squad equipped with mobile gas chambers was deployed in 1942-43 to the German-occupied Krasnodar region, now in southern Russia.
""As a result of one such operation, on Oct. 9 and 10, 1942, a mass murder of children at the Yeysk orphanage was committed.""
Oberlander first served as a translator for Nazi death squads and later as an infantryman in the German army, according to 2018 court documents.
Oberlander has said he was forced to join one of the Nazis' ""Einsatzkommando"" mobile killing squads at the age of 17 and did not take part in any atrocities.
The Investigative Committee said in October it had opened a inquiry into suspected genocide over the murders and that the bodies of 214 children had been found in 1943 after Nazi forces were driven out of the region.
The Investigative Committee said several translators and members of the death squad in the Krasnodar area were arrested and convicted in the 1940s and 1960s.
""However, Oberlander, was able to escape criminal responsibility by hiding from preliminary investigative organs immediately after Germany's capitulation (in 1945),"" it said."

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Friday said he would help Pakistan stay off a terrorism financing blacklist at a meeting of a global finance watchdog, a move he suggested would counter ""political pressure"" from Islamabad's critics.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which tackles money laundering, told Islamabad late last year that it could face blacklisting if it continued to apply inadequate controls over terrorism financing.
The FATF is meeting next week in France, and support from Turkey and longtime allies like China, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia could help Pakistan remain off the blacklist. A minimum of three votes are required for any country to escape the blacklisting.
If it joined the blacklist alongside Iran and North Korea, Islamabad would face sanctions and economic setbacks at a time when its economy is struggling with a balance of payment crisis.
""We will be supporting Pakistan at the Financial Action Task Force meetings, where Pakistan is subject to political pressure,"" Erdogan told Pakistan's parliament a day after he arrived in Islamabad.
The FATF already has Pakistan on its ""gray-list"" of countries with inadequate controls over curbing money laundering and terrorism financing.
But its arch-rival India, which came close to war with its nuclear-armed neighbor last year, wants Pakistan blacklisted.
Of 40 recommendations made by the watchdog, Pakistan had fully complied with only one, largely complied with nine, partially complied with 26, and totally missed four parameters, which were mandatory if Islamabad wanted to be removed from the gray-list, a review by the group last year said.
The FATF says Pakistan should adequately identify, assess and understand risks associated with militant groups operating in Pakistan such as Islamic State group, al-Qaeda, Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD), Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), which continue to raise funds openly.
Pakistan says it has made a significant improvement on the requirements since the last review.
Islamabad says it has seized the groups' assets and put the militants on trials, like the entire leadership of the JuD, including its chief Hafiz Saeed, the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks in India, which killed 166 people.
In a move praised by Washington as an important step forward, Saeed was jailed for 11 years on Wednesday on terrorism financing charges.
Pakistan remained committed to the earliest completion of its FATF action plan, Minister for Economic Affairs Hammad Azhar tweeted on Wednesday."

PARIS (Reuters) - Benjamin Griveaux, French President Emmanuel Macron's preferred candidate to become the Mayor of Paris, withdrew his candidacy on Friday following what he said were ""ignoble attacks"" on his private life relating to internet leaks over sexual material.
Griveaux, a close Macron ally and a former government spokesman, was central to Macron’s bid to control Paris City Hall to build a local power base for his party.
""I have decided to withdraw my candidacy from the municipal election,"" Griveaux said in a televised address.
""For more than a year my family and I were subjected to defamatory, false statements, anonymous attacks, the disclosure of private and stolen conversations and death threats,"" he said.
He said a new level had been reached on Thursday with ""websites and social networks carrying ignoble attacks about my private life.""
Griveaux, 42, is one of the “Macron boys” - the clique that helped propel the former investment banker to the Elysee Palace.

While negotiators from the warring sides pressed on with meetings in Doha, Qatar, the Taliban and the Afghan government both reported fighting on the ground.
The Afghan defense ministry said an air strike had killed a senior Taliban commander in northern Balkh province on Thursday evening.
""As result of a targeted air strike by Afghan air forces, Mawlavi Sardar Mohammad, a key member of the Taliban military commission was killed along with eight others,"" the ministry said in a statement.
The Taliban did not confirm the air strike.
A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said the insurgents had killed six Afghan soldiers, including two officers, in an attack on a checkpoint in northern Kunduz province.
Afghan, Taliban and U.S. sources said a peace deal could be signed this month, allowing a withdrawal of some of 13,000 U.S. troops and thousands of other NATO personnel that remain in Afghanistan following the U.S. intervention to oust the Taliban in 2001.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday there was a ""good chance"" of reaching an agreement with the Taliban on a reduction of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

Italy's cabinet on Thursday approved a reform of the statute of limitations, which wipes out trials if a verdict is not reached within a set limits.
Renzi, the leader of the Italia Viva party, which opposes the reform, challenged Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to put together a new coalition after Conte appealed for unity among the feuding ruling parties.

BEIJING (Reuters) - There were no doctors, nurses or medical equipment at the Wuhan hotel converted into a temporary quarantine facility for suspected coronavirus patients when brothers Wang Xiangkai and Wang Xiangyou arrived two weeks ago. 
The next day, Xiangkai, 61, woke to find that Xiangyou, 62, had died.
The Wangs are among tens of thousands of families devastated by the coronavirus in Wuhan, where the medical system has been overwhelmed by the outbreak, despite massive reinforcements and two speedily built new hospitals.
""What did we do to deserve such punishment?"" Wang Wenjun, Xiangkai's daughter, said over the phone to Reuters.
A crematorium sent a car to pick up Xiangyou's body, but the family was told no mourning ceremony would be allowed. They could only collect his ashes after 15 days.
Two days before Xiangyou died, doctors at the 4th Hospital of Wuhan had written in a diagnosis that both brothers were likely infected by the coronavirus which has now killed over 1,350 people in China. CT scans showed their lungs had turned ""white"" with patterns resembling cracked glass, symptomatic of severe viral infections. 
But the hospital did not have any RNA test kits to confirm their cases, and thus could not admit them for treatment, according to the doctors. They were told to contact their community government, which on Jan. 30 offered to house the brothers at the hotel.
Hubei province on Thursday reported a sharp rise in the number of deaths and cases after changing its methodology to include those diagnosed through CT scans like Xiangyou. More than 63,000 people have now been infected nationwide and 1,380 have died. 
Xiangkai, a retired cab driver, refused to remain at the Echarm hotel after his brother died, instead staying alone at a relative's home. His wife visited daily, bringing food and Chinese medicine, until she too fell ill with what doctors suspect is the coronavirus. 
Wenjun lives on the other side of Wuhan. Closed transportation lines means she is unable to visit her parents. 
Desperate for treatment for her father, she issued a plea for help on the Twitter-like Weibo. The community government responded, saying the decision was up to the virus taskface.
At around midnight on Monday, the family received a call saying a hospital bed was available. With no public transport, Wang's 58-year-old wife pushed him in a wheelchair for the 10-minute trip to the hospital.
A new CT scan showed Xiangkai's lung infection had worsened. He now has trouble walking to the toilet on his own and is awaiting the results of an RNA test.
""On Jan. 22, our entire family had a Lunar New Year dinner, and we even took a photo together. It has been bad news every day since then,"" Wenjun said.

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 02:16AM ET</span>",Lenders cheered as Kenya binged on medical equipment. Did patients get help?,"By Maggie Fick
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya's health minister celebrated the delivery of a CT scanner at a large county hospital, telling journalists that sick patients could now be diagnosed locally.
Nine months later, the scanner has never been used: the hospital has no radiologists. Patients must still travel 160 kilometers from central Nyandarua to Nairobi's overwhelmed Kenyatta National Hospital, where getting scans can take months.
Kenya won praise from international lenders in 2015 for launching Africa's biggest public-private healthcare program, an unprecedented seven-year scheme to spend hundreds of millions of dollars leasing medical equipment from foreign firms.
At the time, the World Bank described the program as a model that could be rolled out to other African countries, a cost-effective way to obtain expensive equipment that requires specialist staff and resources to service.
But five years on, high tech machines are lying idle in more than a third of the hospitals that received them, according to data from the Ministry of Health and the doctors' union.
Critics say the program has worsened the country's debt burden and diverted urgently needed resources from basic healthcare that would otherwise save lives. They warn that the same costly mistake could be made in other African countries, where lenders are still promoting similar schemes.
""It’s very disappointing that the government missed the opportunity to do something great for the health care system because it wanted to do procurement,"" said Dr Ouma Oluga, head of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union, which estimates Kenya would 10,000 more medical staff to operate the new equipment. ""I think it’s criminal."" 
""BETRAYAL OF TRUST""
The government leased the equipment under a 38-billion-shilling ($370 million) deal with foreign companies including China’s Shenzhen Mindray, India’s Esteem Industries,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and Philips.
According to Mutula Kilonzo, a lawmaker on a Kenyan senate committee that investigated the deal, its cost nearly doubled to 63 billion shillings as the health ministry ordered more equipment.
General Electric,  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) and Philips told Reuters they fulfilled their contracts by delivering and installing the equipment. GE said out of the 585 items it had leased to the government, “13 are not in use but will be fully functional once they are powered.” The other two companies did not respond to requests for comment. The senate committee has not accused the foreign companies of wrongdoing.
Edward Ouko, who left office last year after eight years as Kenya's first auditor general, a post tasked under the constitution with tracking public funds, told Reuters the health ministry had not asked hospitals about their needs before supplying them with identical sets of equipment.
The ministry rebuffed his repeated requests to review the contracts, he said. He described the deal as a ""betrayal of the trust of the Kenyan taxpayer"".
Ouko said funds would have been better spent on expanding basic healthcare, adding that more midwives and more clinics might have saved more lives in a country where 342 women die from pregnancy complications per 100,000 live births.
Neither the ministry’s spokeswoman nor the permanent secretary for health responded to requests for comment.
In October, Health Minister Sicily Kariuki told parliament that regional governments of Kenya's counties had been asked about their equipment needs. However, five county governors have denied their administrations were consulted.
""LOOTING OPPORTUNITY""
When Kenya announced the leasing scheme in 2015, the World Bank praised the government for being the first in Africa to adopt a contracting model widely used in developed countries.
The Bank is still encouraging other African states to follow Kenya's example by shifting procurement budgets to leasing contracts, which include the cost of servicing equipment. Such contracts provide a way for hospitals to ensure that machines are properly maintained, the Bank says. Otherwise, hospitals can end up as graveyards of equipment that falls into disrepair.
Khama Rogo, the World Bank's top health sector specialist in Africa, acknowledged that there were problems in how the contracts had been carried out in Kenya, but said the principle of acquiring medical equipment through leases was still sound.
""It is a fault of the contracting, it's not the concept,"" Rogo said. ""We can’t throw the baby out with the bath water.”
He also said the World Bank had offered Kenya free advice on structuring its contracts, but the government did not take it.
Oluga, the doctors' union head, said government officials viewed the vast new equipment leasing program as an opportunity to divert health spending from basic care into procurement, a form of expenditure prone to corruption.
""The people who are at the top of decision-making in our health care system look at the system first from a looting opportunity: ‘How much can I make?’ No one is interested in the interaction of the patient and the health care system.""
SURGERY BY MOBILE PHONE LIGHT
Some of the new equipment has been useful. Reuters spoke to staff at the main hospitals in the towns of Naivasha and Embu who said dialysis machines they had received through the leasing deal had enabled them to improve care for patients.
But Kenya's health sector faces huge challenges. Doctors say power cuts and shortages of basics like gloves and medicine often force them to improvise, including performing surgeries by the light of cell phones. Public hospitals often ask patients to find their own blood donors.
A CT scanner at King Fahad hospital in coastal Lamu County has been out of service since October because the local county lacks a dye needed to interpret the scans, top county health official Ann Gathoni told Reuters.
So 36-year-old Fatma Kasimu, who was suffering from stomach pains after giving birth last year, had to spend nearly 11,000 shillings ($110) to travel to the city of Mombasa for a scan, nearly a month's wages for her fisherman husband. 
At Garbatulla hospital in northeastern Isiolo County, there is not enough electricity to power radiology and surgical equipment, said four staff who did not want to be identified for fear of being fired. At other locations, equipment goes unused because of water shortages and insufficiently trained or absent staff, hospital employees said.
Most people need only primary health care, said Dr Githinji Gitahi, chief executive officer at Nairobi-based aid agency Amref Health Africa, which runs programmes in 35 African countries. But fancy equipment -- even if unused -- scores more points with voters.

""That's why we ended up with such a high level of waste.""

MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) would help the Spanish government attain a stable majority in parliament and support its budget only if the region's independence drive is addressed in talks, a top party official told Reuters.
The leftist ERC was instrumental in facilitating Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez's confirmation as prime minister last month. Its votes will be crucial for the approval or rejection of the left-wing coalition government's budget plan, potentially defining the government's survival in a fragmented parliament.
""What's important is the resolution of the (Catalan) political conflict. The stability or not of the government will be a consequence on whether the first issue is being addressed correctly,"" ERC's national coordinator, Pere Aragones, said in an interview at the Catalan government's delegation in Madrid on Thursday.
""We will be extremely demanding"" on the political requests to support the Spanish budget and on the details of the budget itself, he said. Further down the road, the party would negotiate support with the Socialists on a case-by-case basis.
ERC's support to the Spanish budget will depend on the evolution of a negotiation table between the central and regional governments on Catalonia's political situation. Talks are due to start later this month.
The talks promise to be difficult as ERC wants an independence referendum and an amnesty for the separatist leaders. Madrid has flatly rejected both.
The talks were a condition set by ERC to abstain in Sanchez's confirmation vote, whose dependence on Catalan separatists was highly criticized by conservatives.
Catalonia has been a dominant theme in Spanish politics since it briefly declared independence in 2017 following a referendum deemed illegal by courts, prompting the country's biggest political crisis in decades.
ERC's chairman was sentenced in October to 13 years in jail for his role in the 2017 bid for independence and its secretary general fled to Switzerland, leaving Aragones as the party's most visible face. In addition to being ERC's national coordinator he is also deputy head of the regional government."

Former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who lagged in the first two nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, targeted Bloomberg over past policing tactics in the largest U.S. city and his comments about a mortgage practice widely seen as racially discriminatory.
Biden did a quick swing through New York City, where he headlined a pair of high-dollar fundraisers and vowed he would win the nomination despite his slow start in early voting.
Democrats are vying to face Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election. Other candidates headed to Nevada, where reaching Latino voters and winning union support will be key to success in the state's caucus on Feb. 22.
Below are highlights from the campaign trail on Thursday:
BIDEN ON THE MONEY TRAIL
Ahead of a weekend visit to Nevada, Biden's fundraisers in midtown Manhattan on Thursday evening raised what one donor said was close to $800,000.
Biden acknowledged coming up short in Iowa and New Hampshire but emphasized that 98 percent of voters had yet to weigh in - including, black voters in more diverse states who have consistently supported Biden in opinion polls.
""I'm confident we'll win South Carolina. I think we'll win or be in a very tight race, one or two, in Nevada,"" Biden said of the next two states to vote.
Biden's poor showing has dented his early status as the campaign front-runner.
But he said his base of support - African Americans and working-class voters with a high-school education - made him the favorite on March 3, Super Tuesday, when 14 states weigh in.
Biden took aim at leading rival Senator Bernie Sanders, questioning the viability of his Medicare for All proposal, and asking if down-ballot Democrats in battleground states would be happy having a self-described democratic socialist at the top of the ticket.
""I'm the only one running that has ever gotten big things done,"" he said.
ON TO NEVADA
Several candidates headed to Nevada late Thursday for a week of campaigning ahead of its nominating caucus. Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and billionaire progressive activist Tom Steyer fielded questions from the audience at a presidential forum in Las Vegas held by the League of United Latin American Citizens, which calls itself the largest and oldest Hispanic organization in the United States. Sanders addressed the group by video link.
Klobuchar told the group of her grandfather's travails immigrating from Switzerland at a time when there were quotas on Swiss immigrants, while Buttigieg, who speaks several languages, answered questions that were put to him in Spanish. Unlike largely white and rural Iowa and New Hampshire, the earliest states to hold nominating contests, Nevada's population is nearly 30% Hispanic or Latino, 10% black and 9% Asian, according to the U.S. Census, highlighting the need to win support in diverse communities. 
NEVADA UNION WILL NOT ENDORSE
Nevada's largest labor union, Culinary Workers Local 226, said it would not endorse any of the eight leading Democrats ahead of its state's caucuses, de-escalating a war of words with Sanders, who finished first in this week's New Hampshire primary.
The 60,000-member union, with outsized influence in a state heavily dependent on tourism, opposes Sanders' proposed government takeover of healthcare funding, amid fears of losing members' hard-won union health coverage.
The union's criticism of Sanders' plan in recent days raised the possibility it would endorse a centrist like Biden. 
The Las Vegas Weekly endorsed Biden and fellow Democrat Klobuchar, both moderates.
Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, U.S. Representative Ted Deutch of Florida and former North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue all endorsed Bloomberg.
TARGET BLOOMBERG 
Biden said he planned to debate Bloomberg on his record on racial discrimination, while Warren slammed his past defense of a discriminatory housing practice known as redlining.
Bloomberg, who is self-financing his campaign, has come under fire for comments he made in 2008 that tied a collapse in the U.S. housing market to a ban on redlining, in which banks decline to make mortgage loans to entire neighborhoods.
""Once you started pushing in that direction, banks started making more and more loans where the credit of the person buying the house wasn't as good as you would like,"" Bloomberg said in remarks that resurfaced in a report by the Associated Press.
""We need to confront the shameful legacy of discrimination, not lie about it like Mike Bloomberg has done,"" Warren wrote on Twitter.
Biden told ABC's ""The View"" he would challenge Bloomberg on the matter and on Bloomberg's past support for a policing strategy known as ""stop and frisk"" that ensnared disproportionate numbers of blacks and Latinos during Bloomberg's mayoral tenure.
Bloomberg has not yet qualified for next Wednesday's Democratic debate in Nevada. He is not competing in Nevada or South Carolina, which votes on Feb. 29.
The Bloomberg campaign declined to comment on Biden's and Warren's statements. Bloomberg apologized for stop and frisk in November a few days before announcing his candidacy.
BLOOMBERG TAKES AIM AT TRUMP
Bloomberg drew crowds of hundreds in North Carolina, one of the states that vote on Super Tuesday, where he will first appear as a declared candidate.
At a coffee shop in Winston-Salem, Bloomberg said he was not afraid of Trump.
""I am a New Yorker. I know how to deal with New York bullies,"" he said.
Trump on Thursday lobbed a fresh series of insults at Bloomberg, calling him a ""loser"" on Twitter. 
Bloomberg's personal fortune, estimated at about $60 billion, dwarfs that of the president.
Several voters in the crowd in Winston-Salem said they wanted a moderate candidate who could beat Trump in November. Some said they were looking for an alternative to Biden after becoming concerned by his debate performances and weak showings in the first two voting states.
Cassaundra El-Amin, a black voter, said she was concerned about Bloomberg's stop-and-frisk policy but felt his apology was sincere.

""I just feel like he might be able to beat Trump,"" she said.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - About 20 gunmen dressed in military fatigues and police uniforms on Thursday killed three policemen and wounded two others during an attack to free one of the most senior leaders of the powerful MS-13 gang, police said.
Alexander Mendoza, a notorious MS-13 figure also known as ""El Porky,"" escaped during the attack in the city of El Progreso, 175 kilometers (108 miles) north of the capital, Tegucigalpa. He was on way to a trial hearing.
The notorious MS-13 crime group was founded by Salvadorans in Los Angeles in the 1980s and spread to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the United States deported waves of migrants.
The most important MS-13 leader on the northern city of San Pedro Sula, Mendoza had been captured in 2015 and sentenced to 20 years in jail on charges of illicit association and money laundering. 
""We are going to recapture this man and arrest those who helped him escape,"" said Deputy Minister of Security Luis Suazo.
Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández offered a reward of 2 million lempiras ($80,000) for information that leads to Mendoza's recapture.
Local television showed images of about 20 uniformed men and with their faces covered shooting and then climbing into several vehicles to escape with Mendoza.

MS-13, along with its rival Mara 18, are among the most powerful gangs operating in Central America, with most of their activities dedicated to extortion, assassinations and drug trafficking.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Residents in Mexico's sprawling capital were encouraged to play it safe on Valentine's Day, as 100,000 condoms were distributed across the city's metro stations on Thursday in the run up to the annual love fest.
Dozens of volunteers, some dressed as garish-coloured condoms, dished out packets of rubber protection across 24 metro stations as part of a campaign to prevent venereal diseases, rising HIV infections across Mexico and unwanted pregnancies.
Celebrating 'International Condom Day' on Feb. 13, sexual safety campaigners from AIDS Health Foundation (AHF) organization launched their campaign using the ""Condom use is sexy"" tagline.
""Unfortunately, every year, because of shame or misinformation, people are infected with various diseases,"" said Miriam Ruiz, head of the AIDS Rapid Testing Area at AHF.
Only 15% of Mexican couples use condoms, according to AHF, and the organization wants to break the ""taboo"" around the use of condoms.
The campaign resonated with many residents in Mexico City, which is home to nearly 9 million people, with over 21 million in its greater metropolitan area.
""I use condoms, but the truth is that there is still a lot of machismo in Mexico and men do not want to use a condom,"" said 23-year-old student Manuela Zepeda.
""I tell men: if you want (sex), put it on,"" she added, while showing the female condom that she had just been given.
Daily HIV infections increased to 44 from 33 per day between 2017 and 2018, according to Mexico's National Centre for the Prevention and Control of HIV and AIDS (Censida).
Lourdes Zamuro, a 63-year-old woman, took two strips.
""These condoms are for my grandchildren,"" she said in front of her smiling husband, Adrian Carrera, 65.
""Things were different before. We can't stop them having sex. Better to inform them and help them."""
1033,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 09:53PM ET</span>",Passengers on ship turned away over virus fears disembark in Cambodia,"SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (Reuters) - Passengers on a cruise ship that spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by five countries over coronavirus fears started disembarking in Cambodia on Friday. 
The MS Westerdam, carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew, docked in the Cambodian port town of Sihanoukville on Thursday. It had anchored offshore early in the morning to allow Cambodian officials to board and collect samples from passengers with any signs of ill health or flu-like symptoms. 
After tests, no one on board was found to be carrying the virus, Cambodia's health ministry said.
Cambodian authorities granted permission for passengers to disembark on Friday morning, the ship's operator, Holland America Line, a unit of Miami-based Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp, said in an emailed statement, ending two weeks of uncertainty for the cruise.
Charter flights were being organized to help passengers return home, the statement said.
""Flight details are being communicated to guests as they are finalized, and it is expected that a full disembarkation will take a few days given the charter flight schedule,"" the statement said.
The sound of cheering inside the ship could be heard from Sihanoukville port when the Westerdam finally docked on Thursday evening.
Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen personally greeted the passengers with handshakes and bouquets of roses as they stepped off the ship and boarded a waiting bus.
""My wife and I gave him some chocolates as a show of our appreciation,"" Lou Poandel, a tourist from New Jersey, told Reuters after he disembarked and met the Cambodian leader.
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Cambodia for its example of ""international solidarity"" that the WHO has been calling for.
Stoking authorities' fears in countries on the ship's route had been the quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp. Of the 3,700 passengers and crew on that vessel, 218 have tested positive for the virus.
On Tuesday, the Westerdam tried to dock in Bangkok, but Thai authorities denied permission. On Wednesday, a Thai Navy warship escorted it out of the Gulf of Thailand, and it set a course for Cambodia, the Marine Traffic website showed.
William Gregory, a 76-year-old American tourist, said he was very happy with how he had been treated on board during the ordeal.

""They kept us in good spirits,"" he told Reuters. ""I didn't stress. Very relaxing. We took tai chi"".

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 09:16PM ET</span>",Fake flyers and face-mask fear: California fights coronavirus discrimination,"By Andrew Hay and Maria Caspani
(Reuters) - A flyer in Los Angeles' Carson area, with a fake seal of the World Health Organization, tells residents to avoid Asian-American businesses like Panda Express because of a coronavirus outbreak. A Los Angeles middle schooler is beaten and hospitalized after students say he is as an Asian-American with coronavirus.
And over 14,000 people sign a petition urging schools in the Alhambra area to close over coronavirus risks, even though there is only one case of the virus in Los Angeles County, with its population of 10.1 million.
These are some of the hoaxes, assaults and rumors Los Angeles authorities spoke out against on Thursday to stamp out anti-Asian bigotry bubbling to the surface in California, where over half of the 15 U.S. coronavirus cases are located.
Bullying and assaults of Asian-Americans are being reported from New York to New Mexico, sparked by unfounded fears that they are somehow linked to a virus that originated in China.
With by far the largest Asian-American population of any U.S. state, officials in California are aggressively trying to get ahead of such hate crimes before they spread.
""We're not going to stand for hate,"" Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis told reporters, flanked by law enforcement officials. She urged residents to report crimes to a special 211 number.
Existing prejudice against Asians has combined with media images from China to create fears that Asian-Americans are more likely to be virus carriers. The discrimination could get worse given chances the virus may spread in U.S. communities in the weeks and months ahead, said Robin Toma, head of the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission.
Face masks commonly warn by Asians to protect against germs or prevent their spread have become a flashpoint, with wearers insulted or attacked out of fears they have the virus, he said at the news conference.
""We need you to step up and speak out when you see it happening to others,"" he said.
FACE MASKS A TRIGGER
Anti-Asian sentiment emerged in 2003 during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, which also originated from China. That was before the emergence of social media platforms like Twitter, where racism, hoaxes and slurs get amplified.
The issue is not isolated to California.
New York City designer Yiheng Yu works in an office where many colleagues have recently returned from China and where she and others wear face masks as a precaution.
On one occasion when she wore a mask outside her office she was accosted by a woman.
""She started yelling, 'Are you Crazy? Get the heck out of here,"" said Yu, 34. ""I realized it was because I was wearing a mask.""
Even coughs can provoke fear, said Ron Kim, a New York state assembly member representing a Queens district with a large Asian and Asian-American population.
""I had a staff member who was in the Albany train station and she was coughing a little bit and someone approached her asked if she had the virus,"" said Kim, who on Feb. 7 established the Asian American Health Advisory Council to educate New Yorkers about the virus.
""We live in a very fear-driven society as it is, so if we add an extra layer it's bound to happen, people are going to be ugly,"" he added.
Manjusha Kulkarni, head of A3PCON, which represents Los Angeles County's more than 1.5 million Asian-American and Pacific Islander residents, saw an urgent need for information to separate coronavirus fact from fiction.
""Businesses and restaurateurs have seen a steep decline in their patronage,"" Kulkarni said of Asian proprietors. ""We only have one case of the coronavirus here in LA."""
1035,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",Barr: Won't be 'bullied' by Trump on Stone case; jurors appalled,"By Sarah N. Lynch and David Morgan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr said on Thursday that President Donald Trump's attacks on prosecutors, the judge and jurors in the trial of a longtime adviser undermined the Justice Department's work, adding he would not be ""bullied"" by anyone.
In an ABC interview, Barr, the country's top law enforcement officer, said Trump's criticism of those involved in the case of Roger Stone ""make it impossible for me to do my job.""
Barr spoke after his Justice Department abandoned prosecutors' initial recommendation to give the veteran Republican operative seven to nine years in prison, prompting all four prosecutors to quit the case. 
Trump has weighed in on Twitter all week with comments that have aroused concerns his administration is weakening the rule of law. 
""I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody ... whether it's Congress, a newspaper editorial board or the president,"" Barr said. 
""I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me,"" Barr said, adding: ""I think it's time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases.""
The White House said Trump was not bothered by Barr's remarks.
""The President has full faith and confidence in Attorney General Barr to do his job and uphold the law,"" White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.
Trump's fellow Republicans also expressed support for Barr.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a staunch Trump supporter, said Barr was ""a great choice"" as attorney general.
""I think if the attorney general says it's getting in the way of doing his job, maybe the president should listen to the attorney general,"" McConnell told Fox News. 
Stone was found guilty in November on seven counts of lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering.
Trump posted a Fox News story on Thursday that accused some of the jurors of political bias. ""This is not looking good for the 'Justice' Department,"" he tweeted.
Seth Cousins, who served as a juror in Stone's trial, told Reuters he was ""appalled"" by Trump's remarks.
""It feels like something outrageous is going on,"" Cousins said in an interview.
""I think it is appalling for the president of the United States to be attacking American citizens for patriotically fulfilling their duties,"" he said.
TWITTER ATTACKS
The Twitter attacks started on Tuesday when Trump criticized U.S. prosecutors in the case stemming from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election to benefit Trump's candidacy.
The Republican president called their sentencing recommendation for Stone ""horrible"" and a ""miscarriage of justice."" Stone's friendship with Trump dates back decades.
Trump on Wednesday thanked Barr, whom he appointed last year, for ""taking charge"" of the case. He also tweeted criticism of U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is scheduled to sentence Stone on Feb. 20.
Trump and the Justice Department said they had not had direct talks on the matter.
Former U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu, who oversaw the Stone case, resigned from the Treasury Department this week after the White House dropped her nomination for a post overseeing economic sanctions, a source confirmed to Reuters on Thursday.
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump's comments on the Stone case amounted to interference in the workings of the U.S. government's judicial branch.
""This is an abuse of power - that the president is again trying to manipulate federal law enforcement to serve his political interest,"" Pelosi, a Democrat, told a news conference. ""This is not what America is about. It is so wrong.""
Chief Judge Beryl Howell, the top judge on the U.S. District Court in Washington on which Jackson sits, also weighed in, saying in an unusual public statement that public criticism ""is not a factor"" in sentencing decisions.
'LITTLE BIT BETRAYED'
In his interview, Cousins said the jury had not discussed politics.
""As a whole group, and in every single conversation that I was involved in or overheard, we never discussed politics as a jury. I have no idea what anyone's political affiliation is,"" he said.
The jurors have kept in touch and followed developments, Cousins said, adding they all ""echo the sense of being appalled. Maybe a little bit betrayed.""
Grant Smith, one of Stone's lawyers, told Reuters the defense team was examining jurors' social media posts. 
Early on in the jury selection process, Jackson overruled Stone's lawyers when they tried to strike prospective jurors who worked for the government or had opinions about Trump. 
All 10 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee called for an investigation. The panel's Republican chairman, Lindsey Graham, dismissed that idea.
He wrote on Twitter that he hoped the court would take the jury allegations seriously if the report was accurate, calling it ""not fair.""
Other Republicans shrugged off the furor.
""I'll leave it up to a judge to decide whether a juror is biased or not,"" Senator Chuck Grassley said. 
Stone was one of several close Trump associates charged in Mueller's probe, which Trump called a ""witch hunt."" His supporters are pushing for a presidential pardon. Trump has declined comment.

The Republican-led Senate last week acquitted Trump on impeachment charges brought by the Democratic-led House accusing him of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his dealings with Ukraine.

1036,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 08:19PM ET</span>",Former chief of staff Kelly rejects Trump North Korea approach as futile: report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's former chief of staff John Kelly has dismissed the U.S. president's unprecedented engagement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as futile, saying he had never believed North Korea would give up its nuclear weapons and Pyongyang had played the United States to its benefit.
Kelly, a former Marine Corps general who fell out with Trump and left the White House in December 2018, laid out his misgivings about the president's policy approaches at Drew University in New Jersey on Wednesday night, the Atlantic magazine said in a report on its website. 
""He will never give his nuclear weapons up,"" the Atlantic quoted Kelly as saying of Kim, who Trump met three times between mid-2018 and June 2019 in fruitless attempts to persuade him otherwise.
""Again, President Trump tried - that’s one way to put it. But it didn’t work,"" Kelly said. ""I’m an optimist most of the time, but I’m also a realist, and I never did think Kim would do anything other than play us for a while, and he did that fairly effectively.""
Kelly's remarks were similar to those of John Bolton, who Trump fired as his national security adviser last September, calling him a ""disaster"" on North Korea policy.
Kelly's comments followed indications that Trump could be losing interest in his efforts on North Korea.
CNN on Monday quoted two sources familiar with the matter as saying that Trump, frustrated at the lack of progress, had told top foreign policy advisers he does not want another summit with Kim before the U.S. presidential election in November.
Talks between the two sides have stalled since last year over an inability to reconcile North Korea's demands for relief from punishing sanctions and other concessions and U.S. demands for North Korea to denuclearize.
On Tuesday, the White House announced that Trump plans to nominate the State Department's deputy special representative for North Korea to a post at the United Nations.
The senior U.S. envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, took over the job of deputy secretary of state in December.
While North Korea has not tested a nuclear bomb or long-range missile since 2017, a confidential U.N. report seen by Reuters on Monday said it continued to enhance its nuclear and ballistic missile programs last year in breach of U.N. sanctions.

North Korea did not act on a threat to present the United States with a ""Christmas surprise"" that some feared could involve a return to testing, but Kim has warned that the world would soon see a ""new strategic weapon.""

1037,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 07:31PM ET</span>","Fake news makes disease outbreaks worse, study finds","By Kate Kelland
LONDON (Reuters) - The rise of ""fake news"" - including misinformation and inaccurate advice on social media - could make disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic currently spreading in China worse, according to research published on Friday.
In an analysis of how the spread of misinformation affects the spread of disease, scientists at Britain's East Anglia University (UEA) said any successful efforts to stop people sharing fake news could help save lives.
""When it comes to COVID-19, there has been a lot of speculation, misinformation and fake news circulating on the internet – about how the virus originated, what causes it and how it is spread,"" said Paul Hunter, a UEA professor of medicine who co-led the study.
""Misinformation means that bad advice can circulate very quickly – and it can change human behavior to take greater risks,"" he added.
In their research, Hunter's team focused on three other infectious diseases - flu, monkeypox and norovirus – but said their findings could also be useful for dealing with the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.
""Fake news is manufactured with no respect for accuracy, and is often based on conspiracy theories,"" Hunter said.
For the studies - published on Friday in separate peer-reviewed journals - the researchers created theoretical simulations of outbreaks of norovirus, flu and monkeypox.
Their models took into account studies of real behavior, how different diseases are spread, incubation periods and recovery times, and the speed and frequency of social media posting and real-life information sharing.
They also took into account how lower trust in authorities is linked to tendency to believe conspiracies, how people interact in ""information bubbles"" online, and the fact that ""worryingly, people are more likely to share bad advice on social media than good advice from trusted sources,"" Hunter said.
The researchers found that a 10% reduction in the amount of harmful advice being circulated has a mitigating impact on the severity of an outbreak, while making 20% of a population unable to share harmful advice has the same positive effect."
1038,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 07:07PM ET</span>",Nigeria's military razed villages in war on Islamist insurgents: Amnesty International,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's military burned down villages and forcibly displaced hundreds of people in its fight against Islamist insurgents in the country's northeast, rights group Amnesty International alleged on Friday.
Nigeria's military, which has frequently been accused of human rights abuses in its decade-long fight against Boko Haram and more recently Islamic State's West African branch, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Previous allegations have sparked investigations by the International Criminal Court in the Hague and hampered Nigeria's ability to purchase arms, a source of frustration for its military's leaders. However, convictions of soldiers have been rare and the military has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.
In the latest allegations, Amnesty said Nigerian soldiers razed three villages after forcing hundreds of men and women to leave their homes in the northeastern state of Borno in January.
The human rights group said it interviewed 12 victims and reviewed satellite images that showed several large fires in the area and almost every structure razed.
Residents described soldiers going house to house and rounding people up, then making them walk to a main road and board trucks, it said.
""We saw our houses go into flames,"" a woman of around 70 told Amnesty. ""We all started crying.""
The trucks took more than 400 people to a camp for people displaced by the conflict in Maiduguri, the main city in the region.
""These brazen acts of razing entire villages, deliberately destroying civilian homes and forcibly displacing their inhabitants with no imperative military grounds, should be investigated as possible war crimes,"" said Osai Ojigho, director for Amnesty International Nigeria, in Friday's statement detailing the group's investigation.
Soldiers also detained six men, beating some of them, and held them for almost a month before releasing them without charge on Jan. 30, Amnesty said.
It cited Nigerian Army statements from the time that said six Boko Haram suspects had been captured and hundreds of captives freed from the militants.
""They say they saved us from Boko Haram, but it's a lie,"" said one man aged roughly 65, according to Amnesty. ""Boko Haram isn't coming to our village.""
Amnesty's report was published as the military struggles to contain the insurgencies, particularly Islamic State. Last July, troops began to withdraw to larger garrisons, dubbed ""super camps"", from smaller bases that were frequently overrun with heavy loss of lives.
That has left the military on the defensive and the insurgents able to roam across large swathes of territory and carry out attacks, often on civilians, with few repercussions."
1039,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 06:54PM ET</span>",UK PM Johnson's meeting with Trump postponed until June: the Sun,"(Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has postponed a trip to the United States to meet U.S. President Donald Trump so he can stay at home to focus on delivering his domestic agenda, the Sun newspaper reported late on Thursday.
The decision to delay the trip would be a further blow to relations between the close allies who are set to begin discussing a trade deal, which Britain hopes will be one of the biggest prizes from its departure from the European Union.
The countries are divided on several issues, including Britain’s decision to allow the Chinese telecoms company Huawei [HWT.UL] a limited role in its mobile network, a proposed digital services tax, and the Iran nuclear deal.
Johnson was expected to visit Washington early this year. This has now been postponed until June when a summit of G7 leaders is due, according to the newspaper.
Downing Street did not have any immediate comment.
The dates for Johnson's trip to Washington had never been finalised, according to one British official.
One of the biggest strains between the two countries came to the forefront last month after Britain granted Huawei a limited role in Britain’s 5G mobile network, frustrating a global attempt by the United States to exclude the company from the West’s next-generation communications.
The allies have also been increasingly at odds over Britain’s planned digital services tax, the U.S. government's threats of more tariffs on goods and the fate of the Iranian nuclear deal — all areas in which Britain has been more aligned with European nations. 
British media reported late in December that Trump had invited Johnson to visit him in the White House in the new year. 
Trump had said Britain and the United States were now free to strike a ""massive"" new trade deal after Brexit.

A possible trade trip to Australia and New Zealand by Johnson has also been scrapped, the Sun reported on Thursday.

""The hostile missiles came from the occupied Golan ... and they were downed before they reached their targets,"" an army statement said. 
Damascus earlier this month accused Israel of attacking military targets in southern Syria including near the capital.
An Israeli military spokesman said they do not comment on foreign reports. 
Israel, which considers Iran its biggest threat, has repeatedly attacked Iranian targets in Syria and those of allied militia, including Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Iran's growing influence in Syria, where it has struck economic and trade deals, has deepened the concerns of Israel and in the last few years raised the prospect of a military confrontation.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Fires across Australia's most populous state are now contained for the first time in nearly six months, authorities said on Friday, as heavy rains aid firefighters and boost some dam levels to their highest in nearly two years.
Australia has been battling hundreds of blazes since September in an unusually prolonged summer wildfire season that was fueled by three years of drought, which experts have attributed to climate change.
Aided by storms that lashed Australia's east coast earlier this week, the New South Wales (NSW) Rural Fire Service (RFS) said 24 blazes remain alight across state, though all are now under control.
""After what's been a truly devastating fire season for both firefighters and residents who suffered through so much this season, all fires are now contained in New South Wales. Which is great news,"" NSW RFS Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
The current situation is a far cry from the peak of the crisis in early January when NSW firefighters were battling almost 150 fires that produced a firefront about 6,000 kilometres (3,700 miles) long.
Blazes across the country have razed nearly 12 million hectares (29.7 million acres) of tinder-dry bushland, killing 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals, since September. 
The fires destroyed thousands of homes and prompted mass evacuations of both locals and tourists under apocalyptic-like red skies during Australia's peak summer holiday period.
As well as aiding firefighting efforts, the deluge of rains has boosted dam levels across NSW, home to more than 7 million people.
With little rain for three years, some parts of the state had less than a year's worth of drinking water left, forcing some authorities to begin to truck in expensive fresh water from other parts of the country.
But nearly 400 millimetres (15.8 inches) of rain fell in the Sydney area and surrounding areas. The Warragamba Dam, which supplies about four-fifths of Sydney’s water, is now 76.5% full - up more than a third in just the last week - and the highest level since April 2018.
Further rains are also seen arriving over the coming days, with more than 50 mm of moisture across the state over the next five days.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro said on Thursday he had picked Army General Walter Braga for his chief of staff, cutting links to political parties in his closest circle of advisors that are now all military men.
Braga, currently the Army's chief of staff and its second highest-ranking officer, will take office on Tuesday,replacing Onyx Lorenzoni, who will move to head the Citizenship Ministry.
Bolsonaro tweeted the announcement of the long-awaited ministerial shuffle that removes Lorenzoni as the last politician in his inner Cabinet.
The appointment of Braga, the second active-duty general in the Cabinet, raises to seven the number of military men in the 20-member Cabinet, not counting Vice President Hamilton Mourao, a retired general.
""This militarization, especially of the inner circle of ministers in the Planalto Palace, reinforces the image Bolsonaro wants to have, that he is not allied to any political group,"" said Leonardo Barreto at Vector Analysis political consultancy.
Distrust of politicians likely was another reason Bolsonaro, a former Army captain, preferred to rely on military advisors to help run the government, Barreto said.
Bolsonaro took office last year on a wave of conservative sentiment by Brazilians fed up with corrupt politics and vowed to break away from traditional parties. He has since broken with the small party he piggy-backed on to get elected and launched his own movement called the Alliance for Brazil.
The replacement of Lorenzoni, one of the first politicians to back Bolsonaro's presidential 2018 bid, was expected since last year. He failed to mobilize political support for the government's agenda in Congress, a job that went to Army General Luiz Eduardo Ramos in June.
The chief of staff post also lost power with the recent transfer to the Economy Ministry of a program responsible for drawing investment for the privatization of state assets.
Among the most active military cabinet members is Infrastructure Minister Tarcisio Freitas, a retired Army engineer, who is heading efforts to modernize Brazil's roads, ports, railways and airports.
A third active-duty officer in the government is Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Marcos Pontes, Brazil's first and only astronaut and now minister of science and technology.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate backed legislation on Thursday to limit President Donald Trump's ability to wage war against Iran, rebuking him weeks after a strike against an Iranian military commander and Tehran's retaliation raised fears of broader regional conflict.
Eight of Trump's fellow Republicans joined Democrats to pass the war powers resolution by 55-45. The measure would require Trump to remove U.S. troops engaged in hostilities against Iran unless Congress declares war or passes a specific authorization for the use of military force. 
Trump has promised a veto and there is not expected to be enough support to muster the two-thirds Senate supermajority to override. Fifty-three of the 100 senators are Republicans who rarely break with the president.
Senators voted nearly along party lines a week ago to acquit Trump of impeachment charges, after an investigation and trial that underscored Washington's bitter partisan divides.
Opponents said the resolution's passage sent the wrong message.
""We need to send a message of firmness, and not weakness,"" said Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, a lead sponsor of the resolution, said the vote showed strength and reflected the importance of Congress weighing in on the decision to deploy troops.
Even if the Senate cannot override a veto, Kaine said the resolution's backers hoped it would influence Trump when it came to future military action, adding that the president cared about what the public thinks, if not the Senate.
""The bill getting to his desk is an indication that we're listening to our constituents and we're telling him blundering into another war would be a bad idea,"" Kaine told a news conference after the vote. 
The bill's supporters also noted that they were gaining more support for their efforts to take back Congress' authority to declare war. The Constitution gives that authority to Congress, not the president, but presidents from both parties in recent decades have expanded the White House's authority to pursue military action without legislators' input.
In June, another resolution that would have required Trump to get Congress' permission before striking Iran failed in the Senate.

The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed a similar resolution last month, also by less than a two-thirds majority. In addition, there are enough differences between the Senate's version and the House's that it must pass that chamber again before it can be sent to Trump's desk.

""If you make the slightest error, we will hit both of you,"" Major General Hossein Salami said at a ceremony marking the 40th day since the death of top commander Qassem Soleimani. 
Soleimani, who was head of the Quds Force, a branch of the Guards responsible for operations outside Iran, was killed by a U.S. drone in Baghdad on Jan. 3 along with Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.
The killing of Soleimani will lead to the liberation of Jerusalem, the spokesman for the Revolutionary Guards said earlier, according to the Tasnim news agency.
""The cowardly and craven assassination of commander Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis by the Americans will lead to the liberation of Jerusalem, by the grace of God,"" Ramezan Sharif said.
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said last week that Iran would support Palestinian armed groups as much as it could and urged Palestinians to confront a U.S. plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace.
U.S. President Donald Trump announced a plan that would set up a Palestinian state with strict conditions but allow Israel to take over long-contested Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. Palestinian leaders reject it as biased toward Israel.
On Thursday, Iranian state TV aired an interview with Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in which he described a close relationship with Soleimani, highlighting the key role Soleimani played in helping build up Hezbollah's rocket arsenal as well as his role in military operations during Hezbollah's war with Israel in 2006. 
Founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982, Lebanese group Hezbollah is a critical part of an Iranian-backed regional military alliance.
Soleimani also played an important role in Iraq's battle against Islamic State, Nasrallah said, and asked for Hezbollah operational commanders to work with Iraqi security forces in battling the militant group when they first blazed across large swathes of Iraq in 2014.

Separately, Soleimani urged Iranians to support Khamenei and said political factions should put aside their differences. He made the call in his will, which was read by the new Quds Force chief, Brigadier General Esmail Ghaani, at a ceremony in Tehran.

BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - The Chinese province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak reported a record rise in deaths and thousands more infections using a broader definition on Thursday, while Japan became the third place outside mainland China to suffer a fatality.
The epidemic has given China's ruling Communist Party one of its sternest challenges in years, constrained the world's second largest economy and triggered a purge of provincial bureaucrats.
With China's streets, restaurants and flower markets bare, a miserable Valentine's Day was expected on Friday.
Japan confirmed its first coronavirus death - a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo - adding to two previous fatalities in Hong Kong and the Philippines. For all related coverage on the outbreak, click: https://www.reuters.com/live-events/coronavirus-6-id2921484
For related Reuters graphics on the new coronavirus, click: https://tmsnrt.rs/2GVwIyw 
Japan is one of the worst affected of more than two dozen other countries and territories that have seen hundreds of infections from the flu-like sickness. 
The Japanese woman fell ill in January but only later showed symptoms of pneumonia and was hospitalized, with coronavirus confirmed after her death and the contagion route under investigation, the health minister said.
However, the big jump in China's reported cases reflects a decision by authorities there to reclassify a backlog of suspected cases by using patients' chest images, and is not necessarily the ""tip of an iceberg"" of a wider epidemic, a top World Health Organization official said on Thursday.
Mike Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies program, said that more than 14,000 new cases reported in Hubei province overnight came after a change to include results from quicker computerized tomography (CT) scans that reveal lung infections, rather than relying just on laboratory tests to confirm cases.
""We've seen this spike in the number of cases reported in China, but this does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,"" Ryan told a briefing in Geneva.
The biggest cluster of infections outside China is on a cruise liner now quarantined off a Japanese port and a further 44 cases were reported on board on Thursday, raising the total to 219. But authorities said some elderly people would finally to be allowed to disembark on Friday.
""Outside the cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship we are not seeing a dramatic increase in transmission outside China,"" the WHO's Ryan said.
He added that the main U.N. health agency expected the rest of a special WHO team to arrive in China over the coming weekend to investigative the epicenter of the epidemic.
U.S. President Donald Trump praised China over its response and said Washington was working closely with Beijing. ""I think they've handled it professionally, and I think they're extremely capable,"" Trump said in a podcast broadcast on iHeart Radio.
But Trump's top White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, was more critical. ""We're a little disappointed in the lack of transparency coming from the Chinese, these numbers are jumping around... there was some surprise,"" he told reporters.
CHINA DEATH TOLL CLIMBING
In central China's Hubei province, officials said 242 people died on Wednesday, the biggest daily rise since the flu-like virus emerged in the provincial capital Wuhan in December. 
Total deaths in China are 1,367.
The rise, following a forecast earlier this week by China's senior medical adviser that the epidemic might end there by April, halted a global stocks rally. [MKTS/GLOB]
But it appeared largely due to the change in methodology.
Hubei had previously only allowed infections to be confirmed by RNA tests, which can take days. RNA, or ribonucleic acid, carries genetic information allowing identification of viruses.
But it has also begun using CT scans of lungs, the Hubei health commission said, to pinpoint and isolate cases faster.
As a result, another 14,840 new cases were reported in the province on Thursday, up from 2,015 new cases nationwide a day earlier. But excluding cases confirmed using the new methods, the number of new cases rose by only 1,508.
About 60,000 people have been infected in total, the vast majority of them in China. 
BACKLASH AGAINST BUREAUCRATS
The outbreak, believed to have emerged from a Wuhan market where wildlife was traded illegally, has triggered a backlash against local political leaders.
Provincial Communist Party boss Jiang Chaoliang was fired as secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee, and Ma Guoqiang removed as party chief in Wuhan, state media said. They were the two highest-profile officials to be axed since the outbreak.
Chinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are weeks away, although WHO chiefs have cautioned a vaccine could take 18 months.
While the Princess Diamond cruise liner remained in quarantine, another luxury liner, the MS Westerdam, was finally allowed to dock in Cambodia after being barred from Guam, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand over fears that one of its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus - even though none had tested positive.

The Westerdam's passengers clapped and cheered on their arrival at sunset.

In a statement, the military said the guided-missile cruiser Normandy boarded a dhow, a traditional sailing vessel, in the Arabian Sea on Sunday.
""The weapons seized include 150 'Dehlavieh' anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM), which are Iranian-manufactured copies of Russian Kornet ATGMs,"" the statement said.
""Other weapons components seized aboard the dhow were of Iranian design and manufacture and included three Iranian surface-to-air missiles,"" it said.
The military said that the weapons seized on Sunday were ""identical"" to those seized by another U.S. warship in November. 
Last year, the guided-missile destroyer Forrest Sherman seized advanced missile parts believed to be linked to Iran from a boat it had stopped in the Arabian Sea.
In recent years, U.S. warships have intercepted and seized Iranian arms likely bound for Houthi fighters in Yemen.
Under a United Nations resolution, Tehran is prohibited from supplying, selling or transferring weapons outside the country unless approved by the Security Council. A separate U.N. resolution on Yemen bans the supply of weapons to Houthi leaders.
The Houthis have built their arsenal using local manufacturing, foreign expertise and parts smuggled in from Iran, their ally, and elsewhere. The conflict in Yemen is seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

The base, known as K1 near the city of Kirkuk, is where a U.S. civilian contractor was killed in December in a similar attack, blamed by Washington on Iran-backed militias.
A Reuters witness said U.S. warplanes had scrambled and were soaring overhead shortly after the attack on Thursday. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the rocket.
The December attack was followed by retaliatory U.S. strikes that killed some two-dozen militiamen, attacks by crowds on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and then the killing by U.S. drone strike in Baghdad of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani - a series of events that brought the region close to full-scale conflict.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 02:07PM ET</span>",Sinn Fein path to power blocked as Fianna Fail rules out deal,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's largest party Fianna Fail will not consider going into government with Sinn Fein, it said on Thursday, in a decision that is likely to prevent the left-wing nationalists from entering power for the first time. 
The decision effectively leaves Ireland's two dominant center-right parties - Fianna Fail and Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael - with a choice of joining forces or risking an election that could further boost Sinn Fein.
Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army, shocked the Irish establishment by securing the most votes in a national election last weekend. Its vote almost doubled to 24% on promises of mass state house-building, a rent freeze and across-the-board increases in public spending.
But the low number of candidates it ran meant it was edged into second by number of seats -- a mistake it would not make in a repeat election. Fianna Fail, which has 38 seats in a fractured 160-seat parliament, said it will seek to form a government that does not include Sinn Fein's 37 seats.
""It was very clear and do not underestimate the strength of Fianna Fail position's at every level, grassroots, voters and members of the parliamentary party in relation to Sinn Fein,"" Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin told national broadcaster RTE in an interview after the party met to discuss the option.
Senior Fianna Fail lawmaker Niall Collins had earlier told Reuters that the party fully backed the position.
Fianna Fail first plans to speak to smaller parties before its historic rival Fine Gael, which has 35 seats. Martin said the process will be so difficult that he could not rule out another election. 
Varadkar said during the campaign that he would consider entering a full coalition with Fianna Fail for the first time. He added on Wednesday that he would be willing to help form a government if Sinn Fein fails to do so.
Both parties would need at least one of Ireland's smaller parties to join them to reach a majority.
""SLAP IN THE FACE""
Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have long shunned Sinn Fein, citing policy differences and the party's historic links to the IRA, which fought British rule in Northern Ireland for decades in a conflict in which some 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace deal.
Both parties are also opposed to Sinn Fein's high-spending promises, its pledge to scrap property tax and plans to hike income taxes on high earners they say would discourage foreign multinationals that employ one-in-10 Irish workers.
Sinn Fein on Thursday effectively admitted it could not enter power without one of the two large parties, with leader Mary Lou McDonald telling reporters it would be ""very, very tricky to construct such a government.""
But she said a Fianna Fail-Fine Gael coalition would be ""a slap in the face to the Irish electorate"" who had clearly expressed a desire for change. 
""I cannot imagine who would be prepared to facilitate these two parties,"" she said. 
The Green Party, with 12 seats, and the Social Democrats on six are the two largest of the remaining parties that may be open to a coalition deal. The Labour Party, which also has six seats, said it plans to sit on the opposition benches.
Several Fianna Fail lawmakers, including McGrath, suggested the party could lead a minority government similar to the previous administration, led by Varadkar, that relied on a co-operation deal with Fianna Fail, then the main opposition party.
Fine Gael is less keen on a mirror image of the ""confidence and supply"" agreement that led to both parties losing seats.
Any tie-up would also face considerable opposition within both parties, with lawmakers fearing it would undermine their respective identities and provide Sinn Fein the platform of lead opposition party. 

""We have always said we would speak to Fianna Fail but I think that would be a difficult process,"" Fine Gael deputy leader Simon Coveney told RTE.

AMMAN (Reuters) - More than 800,000 Syrians, mostly women and children, have fled their homes during a Russian-backed Syrian military campaign to clear the opposition in northwest Syria since Dec. 1, a senior U.N. spokesperson said on Thursday.
The exodus is expected to continue, with thousands of people on the move as whole towns and communities flee to the safety of areas near the Turkish border, David Swanson told Reuters. 
""Tragically, the number of people displaced – the vast majority of them women and children – has now surpassed 800,000,"" Swanson said.
Russian jets and Syrian artillery have pounded towns and villages since early December in a renewed assault backed by pro-Iranian militias and aimed at clearing the opposition.
""Residents are fleeing by the thousands in open trucks or by foot; often at night to escape detection despite the bitter cold temperatures,"" Swanson, the U.N. regional spokesman for Syria, told Reuters.
U.N. officials say the region is on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe. Those on the run in Idlib and adjoining Aleppo province are joining close to 400,000 people who fled earlier bouts of fighting to the safety of camps near the Turkish border.
The latest offensive has brought the military campaign closer to heavily populated northern Idlib along the border, where nearly 3 million people are trapped, according to the United Nations.
Families fleeing air strikes and advancing troops in Idlib province are sleeping rough in streets and olive groves, and burning toxic bundles of rubbish to stay warm in the biting winter weather, aid workers say.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has had ""a pretty important breakthrough"" in peace talks with the Taliban over the past couple of days, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday, but he cautioned that Washington wants to see a significant fall in violence in Afghanistan before starting wider discussions.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper said earlier that the United States and the Taliban have been negotiating a proposal for a seven-day reduction in violence, in what lawmakers said was a test for the hardline insurgents.
Sources had told Reuters a U.S.-Taliban peace deal could be signed this month, a move that would pave the way for a withdrawal from Afghanistan of some 13,000 U.S. troops and thousands of other NATO personnel, 18 years after a U.S.-led coalition invaded following the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on the United States.
The demand to sharply reduce violence has been partly why the talks had been deadlocked, according to a Western diplomat in Kabul.
Speaking to reporters traveling with him to Munich, where he will attend a security conference, Pompeo expressed both optimism and caution. 
""We have made real progress over the last handful of days and the President gave us the authority to continue to have the conversations,"" Pompeo said, adding: ""We are not there yet.""
""We hope we can get to a place where we can get a significant reduction in violence, not only on a piece of paper but demonstrated ... and if we can get there, if we can hold that posture for a while, then we'll be able to begin the real, serious discussion which is all the Afghans sitting at a table,"" Pompeo said.
He is expected to meet with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in Munich, a former senior Afghan official said on Wednesday.
Esper, during a press conference in Brussels, said that if the process goes forward there would be continuous evaluation of any violence.
The news of a potential agreement comes amid continued attacks by the Taliban, who control about 40% of Afghanistan, according to Afghan defense officials.
Last month the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a U.S. government agency, assessed that there had been a record-high number of attacks by the Taliban and other anti-government forces in the last three months of 2019.
Although the Taliban is negotiating with U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, it refuses to talk directly to Ghani's government, which it denounces as a puppet of the West.
U.S. Democratic Representative Tom Malinowski, who has expressed deep reservations about the talks with the Taliban, said he viewed the proposal of a reduction in violence as a test of the Taliban leadership.
""We also need to see whether the Taliban leadership conducting these negotiations actually can control what their forces in the field do. And I'm glad to see that intra-Afghan talks are supposed to start if this test is passed,"" he told Reuters.

1051,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 01:31PM ET</span>",Mali troops return to key northern city after six-year absence,"BAMAKO (Reuters) - More than 200 Malian troops reached the northern city of Kidal on Thursday, the army said, in the military's first permanent deployment there since being chased out by Tuareg separatist rebels in 2014.
Photos shared by the U.N.'s peacekeeping mission showed state governor Sidi Mohamed Ag Ichrach welcoming the army convoy to Kidal, the epicenter of repeated rebellions by semi-nomadic Tuaregs seeking an independent state called Azawad.
It marks a symbolic victory for the government's efforts to restore state authority in northern Mali and implement a 2015 peace deal with the rebels that promised greater local autonomy in exchange for the return of state forces.
""I confirm the army has arrived in Kidal. They got there without any problem,"" army spokesman Diarran Kone said.
A detachment of 240 soldiers - one-third each drawn from existing army ranks, former separatist rebels and pro-government militiamen - set out by road from the northern city of Gao on Monday.
In a sign of the precarious security situation, peacekeepers and helicopters from the U.N. mission in Mali had been deployed to accompany the convoy, while the foreign minister tweeted on Monday that ""all of Mali is holding its breath"".
The most recent Tuareg insurrection, in 2012, led to the takeover of Mali's entire desert north by the rebels and loosely aligned Islamist militants, before French forces intervened the following year to beat back the jihadists.
But large swathes of the desert north have remained beyond the government's full control. Malian forces were forced to flee Kidal in 2014 after gun battles broke out during a visit by the prime minister, killing 50 soldiers.
Squabbling among the parties has slowed implementation of the 2015 deal. The political upheaval has complicated Western-backed efforts to combat jihadists linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State, who have stepped up their attacks in Mali and neighboring countries.
In all, 428 soldiers will be deployed across the Kidal region in the coming days, officials say, and the army presence should be progressively extended to other parts of the north, where the state's authority is weak.
""We have worked a lot to arrive at this result,"" said Almou Ag Mohamed, the spokesman for the CMA separatist coalition. ""We are talking a lot about Kidal today but the deployment of this army has to be done in Timbuktu, Gao and ... Menaka.""
Ibrahim Maiga, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) think-tank, said the army's return to Kidal was highly symbolic but its true import remained to be seen.
""I think that this is above all a test of the good faith of the actors,"" said Maiga. ""I see it much more as a test than a turning point or decisive step."""

The filing in The Hague by Caracas against its political rival Washington does not automatically lead to an investigation and the ICC does not hear cases between states.
The United States has targeted Caracas with sanctions and, like dozens of other countries, recognizes opposition politician Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate interim leader.
In September 2018, a group of Latin American countries and Canada asked the ICC to investigate Venezuela’s government over allegations of crimes against humanity in using force to repress political opponents. That request is still under review.
Speaking to journalists in The Hague, Arreaza said Venezuela sets out its accusations in a 60-page brief to the court. It claims that the U.S. policy of sanctions has been ""a death sentence for tens of thousands of Venezuelans per year.""
The ICC prosecutes individuals and the document did not name any U.S. officials, but Arreaza said determining who was responsible was a task for the prosecutor.
The U.S. embassy in The Hague declined immediate comment on Venezuela's request to the ICC prosecutor.
The so-called referral was handed to ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda earlier on Thursday, Arreaza said, and was accompanied by a letter from Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
""Our government is seeking refuge with international law,"" Arreaza said. ""We are convinced the consequences of the unilateral measures (by the United States) constitute crimes against humanity against the civilian population.""
Venezuela said that as a member of the ICC alleged crimes on its territory fall within the jurisdiction of the world's permanent war crimes court _ created to punish the most serious international atrocities, such as war crimes and genocide.
Asked why Venezuela had not filed its request against the countries that asked the ICC for an investigation in 2018 - Canada, Peru, Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Paraguay - Arreaza said: ""It is important to go after the boss of the circus, not the staff of the circus."""

LONDON (Reuters) - Boris Johnson forced the resignation of his finance minister on Thursday for refusing to toe the line, a sign the prime minister was tightening his control in a government reshuffle designed to deliver his vision for Britain beyond Brexit.
Johnson, who had wanted to minimize any disruption from his long-planned cabinet revamp, quickly replaced Sajid Javid with his deputy Rishi Sunak, a loyal supporter of the prime minister who is often put before the media to sell government policy.
Johnson's team had carefully choreographed the reshuffle, presenting it as an opportunity to foster new talent, particularly among women, while also rewarding loyalists.
But the finance minister's resignation - which some commentators said might have been sought by Johnson's team all along - added to a sense that the prime minister would brook no dissent and wanted to have more control over the Treasury.
""Whilst I was very pleased that the prime minister wanted to reappoint me, I was unable to accept the conditions that he had attached so I felt I was left with no option but to resign,"" Javid told reporters outside his house.
""The conditions that were attached was a requirement that I replace all my political advisers ... I was unable to accept those conditions, I don't believe any self-respecting minister would accept such conditions.""
Johnson's spokesman said the British leader had set up a new economic team to advise both the prime minister and finance minister so that the two could work closely together.
""It will be based in Number 10 and Number 11 (Downing Street) and will jointly advise the prime minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer as they work to level up the economy across the UK,"" the spokesman said, adding that Sunak had worked closely with his predecessor on the budget due in March.
""EXCELLENT CHOICE""
Sunak, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker who is married to the daughter of an Indian billionaire, is seen by many Conservatives as a safe pair of hands who will easily get on board with Johnson's agenda for a post-Brexit Britain.
David Jones, a former Brexit minister, described Sunak as ""very bright"" and an ""excellent choice"".
The pound and bond yields rose on the expectation that Sunak's appointment would pave the way for a more expansionary budget.
Johnson has promised to reduce the wealth and opportunity gap between parts of Britain by channeling investment into northern and central England, where he won the votes of many traditional supporters of the main opposition Labour Party.
Johnson had not been expected to change the biggest-hitting posts in his government. But the changes he did make offered some insight into how he wanted to tighten his grip on power.
His sacking of Northern Ireland minister Julian Smith, who only a month ago had helped broker the restoration of a government in the British province, prompted criticism from politicians north and south of the border with Ireland.
Smith, who had been in charge of parliamentary discipline for Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, was the first minister to lose his job in the reshuffle. He was joined by others including business minister Andrea Leadsom and environment minister Theresa Villiers.
Ultra-loyal Alok Sharma, a former minister for international development, was appointed as the new minister for business and also the head of the COP26 climate change summit in Scotland in November, due to be attended by world leaders.
Anne-Marie Trevelyan was promoted to minister for international development, while other big departments - such as foreign, home affairs, trade and health - kept their ministers. Former Brexit minister Stephen Barclay took Sunak's old role.
It was Javid's move which shook up the 'business as usual' look that Johnson had wanted to portray. 
Downing Street aides had previously played down suggestions, based on Johnson's senior adviser Dominic Cummings' well-publicized desire to see a radical reorganization of government, that there would be major changes. 
But it was clear that loyalty mattered to Johnson to be able to deliver his agenda and meet the promises he made in the run-up to the Dec. 12 election, in which he won a large majority.
Opposition politicians said Javid's resignation had shown the reshuffle to be a mess.

""This is a historical record. A government in chaos within weeks of an election,"" said John McDonnell, Labour's finance spokesman.

He made clear he would not allow the traditional notion of mother and father to be subverted by what he called ""parent number 1"" and ""parent number 2"". 
""As far as 'parent number 1' and 'parent number 2' goes, I've already spoken publicly about this and I'll repeat it again: as long as I'm president this will not happen. There will be dad and mum,"" Putin said.
During his two decades in power, Putin has closely aligned himself with the Orthodox Church and sought to distance Russia from liberal Western values, including attitudes toward homosexuality and gender fluidity. 
He made the comments as he met a state commission to discuss changes to Russia's constitution. 
The commission was set up last month after Putin announced sweeping changes to Russia's political system that are widely seen as being designed to help him extend his grip on power after his scheduled departure from office in 2024. 
Other proposals have since been put forward and Putin was asked to comment on a proposal to add a line in the constitution defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman. 
""We need only to think in what phrases and where to do this,"" he replied. 
In separate comments during the meeting, Putin said he backed an idea to make it unconstitutional for Russia to give away any part of its territory, a move likely to irritate Japan and Ukraine that have land disputes with Moscow. 
Russia annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has been in a decades-long dispute with Tokyo over ownership of a chain of islands in the Pacific that Moscow seized from Japan at the end of World War Two. 
Russia and Japan have been holding talks on the latter dispute which has prevented the countries formally signing a peace treaty after World War Two. 

""We have talks under way with our partners on certain questions, but I like the idea itself,"" Putin said. ""So let's instruct the lawyers, ask them to formulate this in the right way.""

1055,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 11:37AM ET</span>",German president warns of racist 'poison' at Dresden WW2 bombing ceremony,"DRESDEN, Germany (Reuters) - President Frank-Walter Steinmeier told Germans they must reject racism and anti-Semitism at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of Allied bombing raids on Dresden, which killed 25,000 people near the end of World War Two.
In Dresden, a far-right stronghold where resentment over what neo-Nazis call the ""bombing holocaust"" lingers, Steinmeier addressed a somber ceremony that included forming a human chain to remember victims.
In a mission to destroy civilian morale, British planes pounded Dresden with explosive and incendiary bombs on the night of Feb. 13, creating a firestorm that tore through streets and laid waste to the city's Baroque churches and palaces. U.S. planes joined later.
The bombing of Dresden reminds Germans of the destruction of democracy, nationalist hubris, contempt for humanity, anti-Semitism and racial fanaticism, Steinmeier said in his speech.
""I fear these dangers have not been banished to this day,"" he said, adding they were starting to poison Germany's public life and democratic institutions.
It is not enough for democrats to turn away in disgust, he said. ""None of this must remain unchallenged in our country. We must all reject hatred and incitement, counter insults, contradict prejudice,"" he said.
Historians say the bombing fed a myth of victimhood invented by the Nazis, taken on by East German Communists and later adopted by the far right. 
Today, that manifests itself in annual demonstrations by neo-Nazis from across Europe. Dresden was the cradle of the PEGIDA anti-Islam group and the city is braced for far-right protests on Saturday.
On Monday, Bjoern Hoecke - a radical regional leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) who a court has ruled may be described as a 'fascist', will join a PEGIDA march in Dresden. 
The commemoration comes a week after Hoecke, who wants German history books to be rewritten to emphasize German suffering over that of Jews in World War Two, caused a political earthquake.
Breaking a post-war consensus among established parties to shun the far right, lawmakers in Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives in the eastern state of Thuringia voted with Hoecke's AfD to install a state premier from a third party.
The scandal was so great that it caused Merkel's protegee, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, to abandon her ambition of running for chancellor. 
Dresden residents still remember the night when bombers hit the city. Nora Lang, now 88, was 13. 
""Those were the most horrible hours of my life,"" Lang said in her Dresden apartment. ""The mortal fear and the helplessness - it all came from above, tonnes of it.""
Nora and her younger brother had been separated from her parents and her older brother but managed to find refuge as buildings around them were destroyed in the inferno. 

""I thought maybe this is the end of the war and at the same time I thought it's the end of the world,"" she recalled.

1056,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 11:37AM ET</span>",At least 19 children hurt by shelling at school in Myanmar’s Rakhine state: authorities,"YANGON (Reuters) - At least 19 children were wounded when at a primary school was hit by shelling in Myanmar's Rakhine state, a lawmaker and a military spokesman said on Thursday.
Clashes between government troops and ethnic insurgents have intensified in Rakhine, from where tens of thousands of people have been displaced since clashes began in December 2018, bringing new chaos to the region from which more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled a military crackdown in 2017.
The Arakan Army, which recruits from the mostly Buddhist majority, has been fighting for greater autonomy for the western region from the central government.
Artillery fire hit the school in Khamwe Chaung village in Buthidaung township on Thursday morning, Tun Aung Thein, a local member of parliament, told Reuters by telephone. He said he did not know who was responsible.
""According to the health department, 19 students are injured and one is seriously injured,"" the lawmaker said.
A military spokesman put the number of wounded at 20, and blamed the insurgents for the attack. A spokesman for the AA did not answer phone calls by Reuters seeking comment.
""We medically treated the students at the nearby military post and sent five to the hospital,"" Brigadier-General Zaw Min Tun told Reuters by phone.
The British embassy in Myanmar issued a statement urging an end to the violence, which follows the reinstatement last week of an internet shutdown in the region.
""The increased violence in Rakhine State over the past few days is causing misery for many of the people living there,"" said Dan Chugg, British ambassador to Myanmar. ""Today’s reported shelling of a school on Myanmar’s Children’s Day, following recent deaths of women and children, highlights the impact this is having on innocent people.""
The statement urged all sides to do their utmost to protect civilians and called on the government to lift the internet restrictions.
A months-long internet blackout in four Rakhine townships – including Buthidaung - and one in neighboring Chin state had been lifted in September as peace talks sought to end clashes.
Officials cited ""security requirements and public interest"" for the reinstatement."
1057,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 11:31AM ET</span>",Saudi minister denies any plans for crown prince to meet Israeli PM,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's foreign minister on Thursday denied media reports of a possible meeting between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, amid speculation about normalizing ties between Gulf Arab states and Israel.
""There is no meeting planned between Saudi Arabia and Israel,"" Prince Faisal bin Farhan told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya English website in response to reports that included Israel's daily Haaretz.
""Saudi Arabia's policy has been very clear since the beginning of this conflict. There are no relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and the Kingdom stands firmly behind Palestine.""
The two countries' interest in containing Iran have increasingly converged with both viewing Tehran as a main threat, but Saudi Arabia maintains that any relations hinge on Israeli withdrawal from Arab lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war, territory Palestinians seek for a future state.
Netanyahu appeared last month at a White House event where President Donald Trump offered a peace plan that proposed creating a Palestinian state but diverged from a 2002 Saudi initiative.
The Palestinian leadership has rejected Trump's plan, saying it heavily favors Israel and will deny them a viable independent state.
But Gulf Arab states welcomed the U.S. efforts in a move viewed as prioritizing close ties with Washington vital to countering Iran over traditional unswerving support for the Palestinians.
In 2017, an Israeli cabinet minister said the country had covert contacts with Riyadh, and Israel Radio reported that Prince Mohammed had met with officials in Israel, drawing an official Saudi denial.
Netanyahu, who faces criminal corruption charges and is seeking re-election next month, has previously pointed to covert cooperation with Arab states, without naming them.
The longest-serving Israeli prime minister met Sudan's leader last week during a visit to Uganda and agreed to start normalizing relations.
Prince Faisal said Saudi Arabia had always shown a willingness to normalize ties with Israel provided there is ""a just and fair settlement"" agreed by Israel and the Palestinians.
""Short of that, Saudi policy will remain steadfast,"" he added."
1058,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 11:19AM ET</span>",Turkey says it will hit groups violating Idlib ceasefire,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will use force against rebel groups violating a ceasefire in Syria's northwest Idlib region, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said on Thursday, in an apparent response to Russian criticism. 
Turkey has allied with some rebels in Idlib opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and has boosted its troops, arms and equipment in the region after 13 of its soldiers were killed by Syrian government forces in just over a week. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said his NATO-member military would strike Russia-backed Syrian forces if another Turkish soldier was hurt, and he blamed Moscow for targeting civilians. 
Russia, which supports Assad, in turn accused Turkey of flouting agreements it made with Moscow and of aggravating the situation in Idlib. The Kremlin said Ankara had failed to neutralize militants there, as per a 2018 agreement to establish a de-escalation zone. 
Apparently responding to the Russian criticism, Akar said Turkey was sending reinforcements to Idlib to ensure a ceasefire is maintained and to ""control"" the area, according to a ministry statement.
""Force will be used against those violating the ceasefire, including radicals, and every measure will be taken,"" Akar said, referring to a Jan. 12 ceasefire Ankara says has been violated by Assad's forces. 
The flare-up of fighting has given rise to some of the most serious confrontations between Ankara and Damascus in the nine-year-old war that, since early December in Idlib alone, has displaced hundreds of thousands. 
Aid workers said families fleeing air strikes and advancing troops in Idlib were sleeping in streets and olive groves, and burning toxic bundles of rubbish to stay warm in the biting winter weather.
Since last week, Ankara has deployed more than 1,000 troops to its military posts in Idlib.
On Wednesday, Erdogan said Ankara had given a message to the rebels it supports in the conflict to refrain from acting in an undisciplined way and give Syrian forces an excuse to strike.
The rebels are a mix of nationalist factions and Islamist militants who were rivals but are now closing ranks.
A Turkish official told Reuters: ""Talks are being held with Russia to make sure tensions don't flare more."" Yet he added rebels backed by Turkish artillery had in recent days retaken territory previously lost in Idlib.
Turkey has repeatedly urged Russia to stop the Syrian attacks in Idlib, warning that it will use military power to push back the Syrian forces unless they withdraw by the end of the month. 
Later on Thursday, Russia called on Turkey to refrain from provocative statements about Idlib. It said it was ""perplexed"" by the comments of Erdogan's nationalist partner party leader, who held Moscow responsible for attacks on Turkish troops and said Ankara should plan to ""enter Damascus"".
""We believe that in the context of the tense situation in the north-west of Syria, it is worth exercising restraint and in particular refraining from provocative comments that do not contribute to a constructive dialogue between our countries,"" the Russian foreign ministry said.

Ankara and Moscow back opposing sides, but have collaborated on a political solution to the war.

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 11:01AM ET</span>",Shelterless Syrians burn refuse for warmth in bitter Idlib winter,"By Suleiman Al-Khalidi and Emma Farge
AMMAN/GENEVA (Reuters) - Families fleeing air strikes and advancing troops in Syria's Idlib province are sleeping rough in streets and olive groves, and burning toxic bundles of rubbish to stay warm in the biting winter weather, aid workers say.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been uprooted by a Syrian government assault which has corralled ever growing numbers of people into a shrinking pocket of land near the Turkish border. 
Humanitarian agency officials say it is the biggest single displacement of civilians in the nine-year-old war. But they lack the shelter and supplies to support them.
Relief workers say 10 children have died in the last week alone in makeshift camps that now dot the border area. A seemingly endless flow of cars and vehicles packed with belongings of fleeing civilians jam the roads. Some have also fled on foot. 
In one camp in northern Idlib, a family of four died of suffocation on Tuesday after inhaling fumes from a fire they had made from shoes, old clothing and cardboard, their neighbor in the camp, known as Dia3, said. 
""Most people are bringing bundles of shoes or clothing and burning it,"" Adnan al Tayeb told Reuters by phone. ""The family were sleeping and suffocated.""
The father, mother and their two children were among tens of thousands of people who had driven north to escape the Russian-backed Syrian government offensive.
Up to three million civilians are stuck between the advancing Syrian government troops and the closed-off border with Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees and says it cannot take more.
Storms which blanketed much of northwest Syria in snow this week has worsened the plight of the displaced. Shelter is scarce, with houses and tents already packed with dozens of people. Many who have become destitute have little money to buy fuel or heaters. 
""People are burning anything they have available to them, things that are often dangerous to inhale just to stay warm,"" said Rachel Sider of the Norwegian Refugee Council. 
Mark Cutts, United Nations Deputy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis, said the situation in Idlib was catastrophic. 
""We keep hearing stories of babies and people dying as a result of cold weather and the inability to stay warm,"" he said. 
With the Syrian army on the outskirts of Idlib city, currently home to an estimated 1 million people, a full military assault there could lead to even greater upheaval.
""NO PLACE LEFT""
International humanitarian agencies say the number of people on the move has swamped existing camps in northern Idlib, set up to shelter families displaced by earlier fighting, and people were being turned away. 
""We are seeing people who simply have nowhere else left to go. They are being squeezed into a smaller and smaller area and are feeling very abandoned by the whole world and that the world is just failing them,"" Cutts said. 
The once agricultural rural terrain of Idlib province, Syria's main olive growing district, now resembles the shanty towns on the edges of large congested cities. 
""Families are sharing tents with up to 30 to 35 other people so there is very little space for people to seek refuge in northern Idlib at this stage,"" Sider said.
A resident from the once sleepy border town of Atma said the many people in the human wave pouring north are now sleeping in cars and under olive trees along congested routes.
Some families, with relatives further east, are able to cross from Idlib into areas of northern Syria controlled by Turkish troops. For most, there is no escape. 
""Along the border area in northern Idlib it's overcrowded and the situation is much more difficult,"" said local aid worker Adi Satouf.
Despite the turmoil and constant upheaval in the shrinking area of rebel rule, few people say they would return to areas now under the control of President Bashar al-Assad's government.

""People are no longer thinking of returning as long as Assad is there. They are ready to put up with every injustice and hardship here but not go back to the regime,"" said Ibrahim Islam, a rescue worker now struggling with his family in a camp on the outskirts of Idlib.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 10:58AM ET</span>","Looking to moderate image, Italy's Salvini says his League party isn't far right","By Crispian Balmer
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Matteo Salvini denied on Thursday that his League party is a far-right group, instead portraying it as a moderate force that wants to broaden its appeal to metropolitan voters who have previously shunned it.
The anti-immigration League is allied to nationalist groups in Europe, such as Austria's Freedom Party and France's National Rally, but after a recent election setback Salvini looks keen to moderate his image at home.
""We are not the radical right. We don't have ambitions to be presented as the radical right in Italy,"" said Salvini, who quit government last year and is the de facto opposition leader. 
""One in three Italians vote for the League, so it is clear that the party needs to talk to everybody, not just the radical right,"" he told a group of foreign reporters.
While the League remains Italy's most popular party, with support hovering around 30%, its nationalist ally the Brothers of Italy (FdI) has seen its own backing surge this past year to some 12% from around 4%.
Italian newspapers have reported that Salvini is concerned by the strong showing of FdI and its leader Giorgia Meloni, but he denied this on Thursday, saying all his partners need to grow if the right wants to win the next parliamentary election.
The Salvini-led center-right bloc lost a regional ballot last month in the wealthy Emilia Romagna region, a leftist stronghold, dashing his hopes of a historic triumph that could have triggered the downfall of Italy's fragile coalition government.
Salvini blamed the loss on the League's poor showing in the main city Bologna -- an electoral weakness that has hurt the party before.
""Clearly there is a message that needs to be calibrated differently (in the cities),"" said Salvini, comparing the League's problem to that of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has scored badly in larger urban areas. 
Salvini has struggled to find his political touch this year and he had a setback on Wednesday when parliament voted to lift his judicial immunity, a move that could led to him being charged with illegally detaining migrants at sea.
He said he planned to visit a number of countries in the coming weeks to strengthen his party's foreign credentials.
Salvini is well known within the European Union for his repeated attacks on the 27-nation bloc, but on Thursday, he conceded the EU has its good points, saying it carries much more clout than individual states in delicate negotiations.

During his 14-month stint as interior minister, Salvini sought to strike deals with a number of African countries on returning migrants. However, he said he would have achieved much more if he had involved the whole European Union.

A squadron of U.S. Air Force staff visited Norway's air base on the island of Jan Mayen in the North Atlantic in November to test the airfield and to see whether U.S. C-130J Super Hercules military transport planes can land there.
Tensions have been rising in the energy-producing Arctic as climate change has opened up the region, and Russia has built up its own military presence there and touted the potential of the Northern Sea Route across its northern flank.
Moscow has repeatedly raised concerns over NATO-member Norway's military spending, its moves to develop its military infrastructure and the deployment of foreign military personnel in the country.
Commenting on the U.S. visit to the island, the Russian Foreign Ministry told Reuters Moscow believed Norway's recent military activity was ultimately aimed at Russia and that such actions destabilize the region.
""...the sheer fact of the possible presence of the U.S. Air Force on the island, albeit occasional, is alarming,"" it said.
""We hope Oslo will be responsible and far-sighted in building its policy in the north and will refrain from actions that undermine regional stability and damage bilateral relations,"" the ministry said.
Earlier this month, Moscow accused Norway of restricting its activities on the archipelago of Svalbard, a remote chain of islands in the Arctic, and said it wanted talks with Oslo to have the issue resolved.
The U.S. Air Force visit has also raised questions in Oslo.
Norwegian Defense Minister Frank Bakke-Jensen has played down the implications of the visit on the security situation in the north and Norway's relationship with Russia.
""Individual transport flights to Jan Mayen with planes from allied countries will not impact the security policy picture in the north,"" he told parliament.
He said a request to help with transport flights to Jan Mayen was sent to allied countries in 2019 as Norway's air force was stretched.
He said planes from military forces from Austria, Sweden, Denmark and France had flown to Jan Mayen between 2017 and 2019.
""Jan Mayen will not be used for military activities,"" he said."

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's government has approved new rules for regulating cyber space which opponents say could be used to stifle dissent and free speech.
Under regulations that were approved by the cabinet late last month but were not immediately made public, social media companies will be obliged to help law enforcement agencies access data and to remove online content deemed unlawful.
Companies that do not comply with the rules risk being blocked online, according to a copy of the regulations seen by Reuters. 
The approval of the new rules follows accusations by opposition parties that Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government has sought to intimidate and silence its opponents and allegations of media censorship. Pakistan's military has also faced accusations of cracking down on media and free speech. 
But Shoaib Ahmad Siddiqi, the top official at the ministry of information technology that authored the regulations, said the new rules would help ""identify and weed out unwanted and slanderous online content.""
""We needed to do it to uphold the integrity, decency and respect of individuals and sanctity of institutions,"" he said.
The new rules on social media are described by the authors as intended to prevent live streaming of online content relating to ""terrorism, extremism, hate speech, defamation, fake news, incitement to violence and national security.""
Social media companies will be obliged within 24 hours to respond to a request to remove ""unlawful"" material, or six hours in emergency cases. They will have three months to register with authorities in Pakistan, and must have a physical presence in Pakistan. 
When required, the companies will be required to provide subscriber information, traffic data, content data and any other information or data that is sought, the regulations stipulate. 
The rules also state that interpretations of the regulations by the authorities in Pakistan ""shall take precedence over any community standards or rules or community guidelines or policies or any other instruments devised by a social media company."" 
""OVERREACH""
Nighat Dad, who runs the not-for-profit Digital Rights Foundation in Pakistan, says the new rules will give the authorities unflinching powers to stifle social media. 
""The worrying part for me is that the definition around extremism, religion or culture is so wide and ambiguous and that means they have these unfettered power to call any online content illegal or extremist or anti-state,"" she told Reuters.
""I do fear that this will be used against dissent, free speech and for political gains."" 
Farieha Aziz, founder of Bolo Bhi, a digital rights advocacy group, also voiced concern.
""This is the kind of overreach we were worried about,"" she said. ""They're trying to go beyond the ambit of the law, trying to go above and beyond what the law allows them to do.""

Bozhkov, owner of several gambling companies as well as Levski Sofia, one of Bulgaria's two most popular soccer clubs, last month was charged in absentia with extortion and attempted bribery among other offences.
Earlier this month, Chief Prosecutor Ivan Geshev said Bozhkov had been detained in the United Arab Emirates and his office was preparing a request for his extradition.
Bozhkov, 63, believed to be worth about $1.35 billion, denies any wrongdoing. Bozhkov, who previously owned Levski's bitter city rivals CSKA Sofia, told a Bulgarian TV channel last month none of the charges against him had been proven but he was afraid to return from abroad for fear of arrest.
Geshev's spokeswoman, Siyka Mileva, said among the 11 charges now pending against Bozhkov were money laundering and influence peddling.
Bozhkov also owns Bulgaria's biggest private lottery. But two weeks ago parliament voted to ban such lotteries and bring the one billion lev ($562 million) market under state control in an attempt to tackle corruption, curb gambling among young people and boost funding for sport.
Bozhkov and his Thrace Foundation, named after the ancient region that spanned modern Romania and Bulgaria, northern Greece and westernmost Turkey, has accused the authorities of trying to confiscate his collection of Тhracian antiques, believed to be larger than that held by Bulgaria's National Museum of History.
Prosecutors and the Culture Ministry said a joint inquiry was underway into the registration of Bozkhov's 3,000-artefact collection, its origins and the way the pieces were acquired.
There is no official assessment of his collection's value but Bozhkov said recently he was offered 600 million euros ($652.32 million) by a foreign country for part of it.
Parts of the collection have been exhibited in Germany, Russia and Belgium as well as in Bulgaria's capital Sofia.
Bulgaria is one of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the European Union, which it joined in 2007, and has made scant progress towards stamping out graft and organised crime."

GENEVA (Reuters) - China is dragging its heels in accepting help on the ground from international health specialists, diplomats and experts said on Thursday, noting four days after a World Health Organization (WHO) advance team arrived in Beijing no details have been released on how and when the full mission will deploy.
China has recorded 48,206 cases of a new coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, which emerged in a seafood market in the central city of Wuhan in December. The virus has spread to 24 countries infecting more than 440 people, the WHO says.
Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, won a pledge from Chinese President Xi Jinping during his trip there two weeks ago that an international team would be able to help investigate the virus' origin and spread.
An ""advance team"" of three experts, led by Dr. Bruce Aylward, a WHO official and public health emergency expert from Canada, as well as WHO's Dr. Maria van Kerkhove, arrived in Beijing on Monday.
""Our advance team in China has made good progress in working out the composition of the team and the scope of its work. We hope to have more news to announce soon,"" Tedros told reporters on Wednesday night.
He has said the full mission would include 10-15 experts, but has given no details of who they would be or when they would go to China.
The death toll in Hubei province, which includes Wuhan, leapt by a record 242 on Thursday to 1,310, with a sharp rise in confirmed cases after the adoption of new methodology for diagnosis, health officials said.
""It would obviously have been better if the (mission) team had arrived without delay,” a senior Western diplomat in Geneva told Reuters, though he added they could still do effective work with Chinese colleagues when they arrive.
""It’s just been very worrying and troubling and we are not seeing as much of a substantive and independent role that we would expect at this point,"" he added.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Wednesday it had not yet been invited to send experts to China to assist with the WHO investigation.
""Not only was China very late in inviting international partners to help with the response, but we still only have a skeletal advance team in Beijing, and not Hubei province,"" Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown Law, told Reuters.
Gostin questioned whether Chinese authorities would accept experienced personnel from CDC - thereby setting aside ""political and trade differences"".
""It appears that China has not accepted the U.S. offer of on the ground CDC experts, which is unfortunate. CDC has among the most experienced first responders,"" he added.
Gostin voiced doubts that China would allow WHO experts to verify independently crucial information about the epidemic's trajectory.
""Will they have complete access to epidemiologic, virologic real time data? Will they have the freedom to go into homes and communities...? Will they be full partners in surveillance and public health response?,"" he said.
Xi said on Tuesday that China's prevention and control work on the new coronavirus is having positive results, and the country will win the battle against the virus, state media reported.
WHO officials have said that Chinese authorities have been open and cooperative, sharing data throughout the outbreak.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Amnesty International has accused Somalia's government of creating teams of online monitors who troll journalists and report them to Facebook's standard enforcers in order to disable their accounts and silence critical media voices.
The Western-backed government in Mogadishu detained 38 journalists last year, setting a national annual record, the Somali Journalists Syndicate said last month, raising concerns ahead of a parliamentary election later this year.
Indeed, the efforts by government censors were paying off, with 10 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) accounts belonging to journalists being shut in a single day last June, the London-based watchdog said in a new report on the state of media freedom in Somalia on Thursday.
All were told by Facebook that their accounts had violated community standards, without more specific reasons.
The Somali government rejected the Amnesty report, which also detailed other instances of abuse of the freedom of the press, including beatings and the detention of journalists.
""Somalia... will continue the rule of law which includes media freedom,"" the ministry of information said in a statement.
Some journalists detailed how their online accounts were suspended.
""My Facebook account was frozen on 16th June 2019. My WhatsApp was frozen on 21st June 2019,"" Ali Aden Mumin, a prominent reporter for the local Goobjoog radio and TV, told Reuters.
Mumin, who fled to Turkey last month after receiving threats from Somali security forces, told Reuters he had been beaten and arrested by the forces several times.
Facebook declined to specify the reasons for each suspension, citing privacy concerns.
""The community standards we use to determine violations is based on global standards,"" said Mercy Ndegwa, head of public policy at Facebook for the East and the Horn of Africa.
Amnesty International researcher Abdullahi Hassan said some of the Facebook accounts that were targeted for closure had up to 60,000 followers, in a country where many turn to the platform to find out what is happening.
Newly set up social media-monitoring teams housed in the offices of the president, the prime minister, and the information minister had made it easier to crack down on journalists online, Amnesty said.
These teams observe content posted by reporters and ask them to remove posts critical of the government. If they refuse, they are arrested, Hassan said.
""They are arrested and… given a file full of content they have shared on Facebook. They are told you can remove this content… or we will prosecute you, or we will hang you,"" he said."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's week-long parliamentary election campaign started on Thursday, state TV reported, a vote seen as a popularity test for the clerical establishment at a time when relations with Washington are at their worst since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
The Guardian Council, which must approve candidates, has rejected around 6,850 moderate or conservative hopefuls in favor of hardliners from among the 14,000 applicants seeking to contest the Feb. 21 vote. 
About a third of lawmakers have also been barred from standing again. 
""The 7,150 candidates who are running for parliamentary elections have started campaigning on Thursday,"" state TV reported. 
Pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani has criticized the disqualifications, but like supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei he has called for a high turnout as the country faces challenges over its disputed nuclear program. 
Khamenei, the final authority in Iran's complex system of clerical rule and limited democracy, backed the Guardian Council, saying the next parliament was no place for those scared of speaking out against foreign enemies.
Tensions with the United States have spiked since 2018, when President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed crippling sanctions.
The crisis worsened when Iran's most prominent military commander, Qassem Soleimani, was killed by a U.S. drone in Baghdad in Jan. 3, which led to Iran retaliating against U.S. targets in Iraq on Jan. 8. 
The vote will have no major influence on foreign affairs or Iran's nuclear policy, which is determined by Khamenei. With the disqualification of moderate and leading conservative figures, hardline loyalists of Khamenei are likely to dominate the parliament. 
Pro-reform politicians said in January that they had no candidates to stand for 230 of the 290 seats in parliament, saying Iranians' demands for a ""free and fair"" election were not met because of the large numbers disqualified.
The Council has cited various grounds for the rejections, such as ""corruption and being unfaithful to Islam"". Some 58 million Iranians out of 83 million are eligible to vote.
While supporters of the establishment will vote for hardline candidates, moderates are struggling to mobilize their supporters, who are disappointed with Rouhani's failure to ease social and political restrictions. 
Leading pro-reform parties have been either dismantled or banned since a presidential vote in 2009, in which hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re-elected. His rivals alleged the vote was rigged.
In Tehran, which accounts for 30 seats in the assembly, hardline candidates are headed by Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, a former mayor of the capital who once commanded the elite Revolutionary Guards.

State-run PGE generates electricity mostly from burning lignite and hard coal. The group plans to invest more in renewable sources of energy, mostly in offshore wind, but Szypulski says this is not enough.
""One can no longer continue the business as if there was no climate crisis. I will apply for the job today,"" Szypulski told reporters in the front of PGE headquarters in Warsaw.
He added that PGE, which owns Europe's biggest coal plant in Belchatow, central Poland, should intensify investment in renewable sources as burning coal weighs on its financial results amid rising carbon emission costs.
Szypulski said his first decisions as PGE CEO would be to scrap the company's plan to invest in a new lignite deposit in Zloczew, which is expected to extend Belchatow's life, and to prepare a detailed scheme for a phase-out of coal by 2030.
His plans are in line with recommendations from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a U.S.-based think-tank, included in its latest report on PGE.
""Lignite today accounts for more than half of all PGE's generation, but we find it is loss-making on average long before 2030 under a higher carbon price outlook. Even under a low-carbon price outlook, lignite will only account for a small fraction of PGE profits after 2025,"" the IEEFA reports said.
The deadline for applying for the PGE CEO job and other roles in the management board is Feb. 14.
Top jobs in Poland's state-run companies are generally considered to be politicized.
PGE's current CEO, Henryk Baranowski, was appointed in March 2016. Before that he was a deputy minister in the Law and Justice (PiS) government.
""I am convinced that I meet the criteria for the job,"" Szypulski said."

NNA said a Lebanese military judge had issued an indictment against the man on charges of belonging to the Islamic State militant group and planning the operation on its behalf.
It said the man was suspected of having prepared explosives and of seeking to buy a drone for the attack. The agency gave no further details and did not spell out the allegations against the 20 others.
A Lebanese security source said the man was arrested last month in Lebanon and is expected to face a military trial along with the other 20 suspects, who were accused of helping to plot the operation."
1072,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 08:25AM ET</span>","Lebanon studying its options on Eurobonds, finance minister says","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon is studying options for dealing with its forthcoming Eurobond maturities, including whether to pay the debt, the finance minister said on Thursday after meeting with the president and central bank governor.
The heavily indebted country is in deep financial trouble and must decide whether to repay its maturing foreign currency debt on time, including a $1.2 billion Eurobond due on March 9.
Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday the mood in government was leaning toward negotiating a restructuring of the debt. 
On Wednesday, Lebanon formally requested the International Monetary Fund's technical help in tackling its unprecedented financial and economic crisis.
Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni, speaking after Thursday's meeting, said numerous options for dealing with the Eurobonds were discussed.
""These options, each of them was studied in depth - whether to pay or not to pay - and everyone expressed their view frankly in this matter,"" Wazni said in a news conference.
""The decision ... was that we will continue to study in the coming period so we can take this decision,"" he said.
A decision should be taken by the end of the month but may come sooner, Information Minister Manal Abdel Samad said after a cabinet meeting.
The financial crisis, worse than any Lebanon endured in its 1975-90 civil war, erupted last year as slowing capital inflows led to a liquidity crunch and protests erupted against the ruling elite.
Banks have since curtailed depositors' access to their savings in foreign currencies and blocked most transfers abroad since October. The Lebanese pound has lost more than a third of its value.
Wazni said a circular in coming days would regulate the banks' informal capital controls to bring ""clarity"" and protect depositors. Banks could no longer deal with depositors in a way that was ""illegal and unclear"", he said.
A new circular from the central bank set an interest rate cap of 4% on dollar bank deposits and a cap of 7.5% on Lebanese pound deposits, according to several Lebanese news outlets. 
The circular, published by al-Jadeed, LBC and MTV on Thursday, set a cap of 2% on dollars deposited for a month and a 4% cap on dollars deposited for a year or more. The rates apply on deposits made or renewed from Feb. 12. 
The central bank in December capped deposit interest rates at 5% on U.S. dollars and 8.5% on Lebanese pounds.

The new government, which won a vote of confidence in parliament this week, has urged banks to slice interest rates to spur economic activity and ease the strain on the public finances.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia’s parliament passed a law on Thursday imposing jail terms for people whose internet posts stir unrest, a move the government says is needed to prevent violence ahead of elections but which the United Nations says will stifle free speech.
Ethiopia, for decades one of the most tightly controlled states in Africa, has undergone huge political change since reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office two years ago.
But even as Abiy has freed political prisoners and journalists and lifted a ban on opposition parties, the authorities have struggled to contain a surge in ethnic violence. An election this year is seen as the biggest test yet of whether his ambitious political reforms can stick.
The new law permits fines of up to 100,000 Ethiopian birr ($3,000) and imprisonment for up to five years for anyone who shares or creates social media posts that are deemed to result in violence or disturbance of public order.
Some 297 lawmakers who were present in the chamber voted in favor of the bill while just 23 were opposed.
""Ethiopia has become a victim of disinformation,"" lawmaker Abebe Godebo said. ""The country is a land of diversity and this bill will help to balance those diversities.""
Several of the lawmakers who opposed the bill said it violates a constitutional guarantee of free speech.
Abiy, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his reconciliation with Ethiopia's neighbor and longtime foe Eritrea, has pledged that this year's election will be free and fair. The nation of 108 million people has regularly held elections since 1995, but only one, in 2005, was competitive.
The law was first endorsed by Abiy's cabinet in November. At the time, the U.N.'s special rapporteur on freedom of expression urged authorities to reconsider it, warning it would worsen already high ethnic tensions and possibly fuel further violence.
International rights groups say it creates a legal means for the government to muzzle opponents.
""Politicians or activists or others will be forced to be cautious, afraid that their speech might fall into the definition of hate speech or can be considered as false information,"" said Amnesty International's Ethiopia researcher Fisseha Tekle."

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The new Communist Party chief of Hubei province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in China, said on Thursday he would contain the virus but that the situation remained severe.
Shanghai mayor Ying Yong was brought in as party head in Hubei after his predecessor and the party chief of the province's capital, Wuhan, became the most high-profile officials to be dismissed following the outbreak.
The removal of Jiang Chaoliang, the leading Communist Party official of Hubei province, and Ma Guoqiang, party chief in Wuhan, followed the dismissal of two provincial health officials on Tuesday, and is part of a wider effort by Beijing to remove bureaucrats it accuses of shirking their duties.
The central government has set up a special cabinet task force under Premier Li Keqiang to handle the crisis, and the new appointments in Hubei suggest China's senior leaders are taking greater control.
Reporting Ying's appointment as the new secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the official Xinhua news agency did not explain why Jiang had been removed.
In remarks reported in the official Hubei Daily following his appointment, Ying said he would not fail the party or the people and that he bore a very heavy responsibility.
""At present, the virus situation is still extremely severe,"" the paper cited him as saying. ""We will definitely win the battle to defend Wuhan, the battle to defend Hubei, and the battle to prevent and control the disease.""
Ying worked closely with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the latter's time as party boss and governor of Zhejiang province, which neighbours Shanghai.
Ying, in the same report in the Hubei Daily, cited Xi as saying that controlling the virus was directly related to social and economic stability and China's opening up, and was the biggest priority at the moment.
Wuhan party chief Ma has been replaced by Wang Zhonglin, party boss of Jinan, the capital city of eastern Shandong province, Xinhua reported separately.
Officials in Hubei have been heavily criticised for their handling of the epidemic in a province of almost 60 million people. The outbreak began in Wuhan late last year, and has spread throughout China, killing more than 1,000 and infecting tens of thousands across the country.
Former Wuhan Party boss Ma said in a nationally televised interview that the impact of the virus on China and the world ""would have been less"" if containment measures had been taken sooner.
Analysts have said that the initial delay in raising the alarm in Wuhan may have arisen from local officials' fear of bringing bad news to the attention of the central government, especially as Lunar New Year festivities approached.
After the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-2003, China said it would improve the way it shared information about epidemics, and put in place a new system allowing hospitals to report new cases in real time.
""This Wuhan epidemic shows that the situation has not really improved,"" said Willy Lam, an expert in Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong."

No-one was hurt in the incident at an Amsterdam branch of ING Bank, a spokeswoman for the bank said, although police said one person had inhaled smoke.
""It did not explode, it caught fire,"" said police spokesman Rob van der Veen.
Police disarmed a letter bomb at an office of U.S. information technology firm Unisys near Utrecht. No one was injured. Police said they had ""rendered the letter harmless"" and a team from Amsterdam was investigating.
Several letter bombs have been sent to businesses around the Netherlands this year. No injuries have been reported.
Police believe the two letters that detonated harmlessly this week, in mail rooms at Dutch bank ABN Amro and Japanese printer company Ricoh, are connected with letters sent to seemingly random business locations around the country in early January.
Those included two hotels, a gas station, a real estate agent, and a car dealership, among others. None of the earlier letters detonated.
Police say the person sending the dangerous letters is demanding a ransom of undisclosed size to be paid in bitcoin.
In Spain, the Madrid headquarters of U.S. online retailer Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) AMZN.O were evacuated on Thursday after a bomb threat, police said. There was no indication the incident was linked to the Dutch letter bombs."

The spike in refugees, coming in the run-up to last weekend's general elections, brings the total number of Cameroonians who have fled to Nigeria to almost 60,000, the U.N. agency said.
Conflict between Cameroon's army and English-speaking militias seeking to form a breakaway state called Ambazonia began after the government cracked down violently on peaceful protesters complaining of being marginalized by the French-speaking majority.
The insurgency has forced half a million people to flee their homes and presented President Paul Biya with his biggest challenge since he took power nearly 40 years ago.
The U.N. refugee agency ""expects further arrivals as refugees inform that more people are still in remote border areas and could be on their way trying to reach Nigeria,"" Thursday's statement said.
""Refugees reported fleeing violence and some even arrived across the border with gunshot wounds,"" it said. ""According to new arrivals, most come from areas near the border and have trekked across savannah and forests to reach Nigeria.""
In December, Cameroon's parliament granted special status to two English-speaking regions to try to calm the conflict, but the separatists said only independence would satisfy them.
The roots of Cameroonian English speakers' grievances go back a century to the League of Nations' decision to split the former German colony of Kamerun between the allied French and British victors at the end of World War One."
1078,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 06:57AM ET</span>",Pressure mounts for Swiss parliamentary probe into spying operation,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Senior members of the Swiss legislature are demanding a parliamentary investigation into a spying operation in which U.S. and German intelligence used a Swiss cryptography company as a front to eavesdrop on other countries.
The government has appointed a former Supreme Court justice to look into ""Operation Rubicon"", which for decades involved the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and German BND spy service covertly using Crypto AG's encryption technology to crack other nations' top-secret messages. 
He is due to report back by the end of June and the cabinet will be briefed.
But pressure is mounting for parliament to launch its own investigation to find out who in Switzerland knew about the scheme.
Although the outlines of ""Operation Rubicon"" were known for years, new details about its scope and duration were made public this week by Swiss, German and U.S. investigative journalists. 
If the Swiss state knew of the operation and turned a blind eye to it, Switzerland's image as a neutral go-between in international affairs could be damaged.
Alfred Heer, head of parliament's government oversight committee, told broadcaster SRF he would propose his panel look into the matter.
""This is the fastest way to shed light on the affair,"" he said. ""It is our obligation to investigate this case.""
The center-left Social Democrats have called for a full parliamentary investigation and two other coalition parties said they were also open to a full investigation, which would be only the fifth in Swiss history.
The company used its base in neutral Switzerland to help it sell code-making equipment to Iran, India, Pakistan, Libya, Egypt, Chile, Argentina and dozens of other countries who in effect paid millions of dollars to be spied on. 
The technology was modified to let the CIA and BND break codes, the Washington Post newspaper and German and Swiss broadcasters ZDF and SRF reported. They described U.S. spymasters and their then-West German counterparts as controlling nearly all Crypto operations from 1970.
Several former government officials approached by SRF denied knowledge of the operation or said they did not remember.

SRF cited unnamed sources as saying Swiss intelligence knew of the scheme and that Swiss officials helped block a police investigation in the 1990s after a Crypto executive tipped off authorities.

1079,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 06:37AM ET</span>","Greek islands should not be migrant warehouses, residents say","ATHENS (Reuters) - Residents of outlying Greek islands urged authorities on Thursday to shut overcrowded migrant camps that host thousands of asylum seekers.
Hundreds protested peacefully outside Greece's interior ministry in central Athens, holding placards against the creation of new detention facilities on five islands.
""Our islands should not be warehouses of souls,"" read one banner.
""These people live in terrible conditions in the mud,"" said Theodora Kokkinelli, 50, whose parents live in Moria village on Lesbos. Moria is a hamlet near a sprawling camp that Greek authorities plan to replace with a detention facility elsewhere on the island.
The Moria camp was built to accommodate 2,840 people but housed 19,500 on Feb. 12, according to the latest official count by Greek authorities.
""My biggest fear is that these people, some time, will revolt"" said Kostas Moutzouris, the prefect of the North Aegean administrative region.
Migrants on Lesbos protested last week over their living conditions, while residents staged their own protests demanding the facilities close. Locals have been particularly angered by government plans to build new detention centers, worried that new centers will signals permanency.
Greek authorities on Monday announced plans to accelerate the construction of detention facilities on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Kos and Leros islands. The islands are close to Turkey, from where thousands of asylum seekers head to Europe each year.
""These new facilities are just an extension of the existing camps,"" said Costas Vrachnis, 60, a restaurateur from Samos. ""Our island is getting negative publicity, tourists hear Samos and turn the other way,"" he said.
Hundreds of thousands of people crossed into Europe from Turkey via Greece in 2015 and 2016 before a deal brokered by the European Union limited the flow. But there has been a resurgence in arrivals since around September 2019."

SINGAPORE/SEOUL/LONDON (Reuters) - As lion dancers snaked between conference room tables laden with plastic bottles, pens, notebooks and laptops, some staff from British gas analytics firm Servomex snapped photos of the performance meant to bring good luck and fortune.
But the January sales meeting in a luxury Singapore hotel was far from auspicious.
Someone seated in the room, or in the vicinity of the hotel that is renowned for its central location and a racy nightclub in the basement, was about to take coronavirus global.
Three weeks later, global health authorities are still scrambling to work out who carried the disease into the mundane meeting of a firm selling gas meters, which then spread to five countries from South Korea to Spain, infecting over a dozen people.
Experts say finding this so-called ""patient zero"" is critical for tracing all those potentially exposed to infection and containing the outbreak, but as time passes, the harder it becomes.
""We do feel uncomfortable obviously when we diagnose a patient with the illness and we can't work out where it came from...the containment activities are less effective,"" said Dale Fisher, chair of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the World Health Organisation.
Authorities initially hinted at Chinese delegates, which included someone from Wuhan - the Chinese city at the epicentre of the virus that has killed over 1,350 people. But a Servomex spokesperson told Reuters its Chinese delegates had not tested positive.
Fisher and other experts have compared the Singapore meeting to another so-called ""super-spreading"" incident at a Hong Kong hotel in 2003 where a sick Chinese doctor spread Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome around the world.
The WHO has opened an investigation into the Singapore incident, but said its ""way too early"" to tell if it is a super-spreading event.
SCARY AND SOBERING
It was more than a week after the meeting - which according to a company e-mail included Servomex's leadership team and global sales staff - that the first case surfaced in Malaysia.
The incubation period for the disease is up to 14 days and people may be able to infect others before symptoms appear.
The firm said it immediately adopted ""extensive measures"" to contain the virus and protect employees and the wider community. Those included self-isolation for all 109 attendees, of whom 94 were from overseas and had left Singapore.
But the virus kept spreading.
Two South Korean delegates fell sick after sharing a buffet meal with the Malaysian, who also passed the infection to his sister and mother-in-law. Three of the firm's Singapore attendees also tested positive.
Then cases started appearing in Europe.
An infected British delegate had headed from the conference to a French ski resort, where another five people fell ill. Another linked case then emerged in Spain, and when the Briton returned to his home town in the south of England the virus spread further.
""It feels really scary that one minute it's a story in China... and then the next minute it is literally on our doorstep,"" said Natalie Brown, whose children went to the same school as the British carrier. The school said in a letter that two people at the school had been isolated.
""It's scary and sobering how quickly it seems to have spread,"" said Brown.
TIME RUNNING OUT
Back in Singapore, authorities were battling to keep track of new cases of local transmissions, many unlinked to previous cases.
Management at the hotel - the Grand Hyatt Singapore - said they had cleaned extensively and were monitoring staff and guests for infection but did not know ""how, where or when"" conference attendees were infected. The lion dancers, who posted photos of the event on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), said they were virus free.
""Everyone assumes it was a delegate but it could have been a cleaner, it could have been a waiter,"" said Paul Tambyah, an infectious diseases expert at National University Singapore. He added it was ""very important"" to find ""patient zero"" to establish other possible ""chains of transmission"".
But time may be running out.
Singapore health ministry's Kenneth Mak said the government will continue to try and identify the initial carrier until the outbreak ends, but as days pass it will get harder.
""We might never be able to tell who that first patient is,"" Mak said.
Meanwhile, the fallout from the conference continues to sow trepidation weeks after the event and thousands of miles away.
Reuters visited Servomex's offices in the suburbs of South Korea's capital, Seoul. It was closed and dark inside, and a building guard told Reuters employees were working from home.
A notice posted by building management stated a coronavirus patient had entered the complex, while several young women could be overheard in a nearby elevator discussing whether it had been used by the infected person.
""Do you think the patient would have gotten on this elevator or the other one?"" one said."
1081,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 06:19AM ET</span>",Indonesia accused of putting profit ahead of the environment with new bill,"By Gayatri Suroyo and Ed Davies
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's plans to relax environmental rules to encourage investment have drawn criticism from activists who say the government is putting profit ahead of protecting the archipelago's rich natural surroundings.
The ""Job Creation"" bill, submitted to parliament on Wednesday, aims to open up industries and includes proposals to relax the need for companies to conduct environmental studies and eases rules on coal mining.
It is one of President Joko Widodo's so-called ""omnibus laws"", which aim to change scores of existing laws to cut red tape and attract investment into Southeast Asia's largest economy.
Types of businesses that require an environmental study, known as an AMDAL, will no longer be specified and subject to separate, lower level regulation.
Currently, companies that exploit natural resources must conduct an AMDAL, which is intended to assess the impact of the investment on the environment and local community.
The new bill also removes all mention of AMDAL requirements in the 2014 Plantation law. Plantations, particularly for palm oil cultivation, are often blamed for causing deforestation in Indonesia, the world's biggest palm oil producer.
Business groups have backed the new law but Greenpeace's forest campaigner Asep Komarudin said it could mean companies might now not take into account an investment's ""environmental, social and health complexities at the site level"".
""This can lead to the accumulation of unmanaged impacts and even ecological disasters,"" Komarudin said, citing last year's forest fires in Borneo and Sumatra, floods in Jakarta in January and drought in the southeastern part of the country.
As part of the bill, the government is also seeking to remove an existing rule allowing residents who may be affected by an investment to object during an AMDAL process.
Defending the bill, President Widodo said in an interview with BBC Indonesia this week that he cared about the environment, but ""we are prioritising things related to the economy because the people need jobs.""
Around two million people enter the job market every year in the country of more than 260 million people.
The head of the Jakarta legal aid foundation said the new bill focused on chasing profitability rather than ensuring respect for the law, human rights and sustainable practices.
""Permit applications from big business players are being prioritised,"" Asfinawati, who uses one name, said by text message.
The bill relaxes rules on coal mining, including the removal of a 15,000-hectare (37,000 acres) limit for holders of special mining licences and incentives for miners investing in coal processing such as gassification.
Indonesia is the world's biggest thermal coal exporter and the fuel accounts for around 60 percent of its energy mix, despite targets to use more renewables.
""The rest of the world seems to be talking about nothing but climate change and reducing carbon emissions. And here we are rolling out the red carpet for coal mining under the omnibus law,"" said a former cabinet minister, who declined to be named."

The report said the settlement had been signed on Feb. 7. It did not mention the amount paid in compensation, but a source with knowledge of the deal, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Sudan had agreed to settle the case for $30 million.
The 17 sailors were killed, and dozens of others injured, in the attack on Oct. 12, 2000, when two men in a small boat detonated explosives alongside the Navy guided missile destroyer as it was refueling in the southern Yemeni port of Aden.
Khartoum agreed to settle ""only for the purpose of fulfilling the condition set by the U.S. administration to remove Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism"", SUNA said, citing the justice ministry.
Being designated as a state sponsor of terrorism makes Sudan ineligible for desperately needed debt relief and financing from lenders such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Removal from the list potentially opens the door for foreign investment.
""The government of Sudan would like to point out that the settlement agreement explicitly affirmed that the government was not responsible for this incident or any terrorist act,"" the justice ministry said in its statement, cited by SUNA said.
The announcement comes two days after Khartoum and rebel groups agreed that all those wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes and genocide in the Darfur region should appear before the tribunal. The list includes Sudan's ousted president Omar al-Bashir.
The U.S. sailors' relatives had sued Sudan under the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which generally bars suits against foreign countries except those designated by the United States as a sponsor of terrorism, as Sudan has been since 1993.
Sudan did not defend against the claims in court. In 2014, a trial judge found that Sudan's aid to al Qaeda ""led to the murders"" of the 17 Americans and awarded the families about $35 million, including $14 million in punitive damages.
Sudan then tried to void the judgment, arguing the lawsuit was not properly served on its foreign minister, violating notification requirements under U.S. and international law.
The U.S. Supreme Court turned down the bid by the families last year."

Julian Smith, who was appointed as Northern Ireland minister last July, said that serving the people of Northern Ireland ""had been the biggest privilege"".
Smith was central to restoring Northern Ireland's devolved government, a key element of the 1998 Good Friday peace accord. He won him praise at the time from all sides of the political divide.
Johnson is undertaking a wider reshuffle of his ministers on Thursday.
Colum Eastwood, the leader of the SDLP, one of the five parties that re-entered the regional assembly, said Smith's approach had been central to breaking the logjam after his predecessors had tried and failed in successive talks.
""It defies belief that after the successful restoration of power sharing following a three-year collapse, Julian Smith’s reward is a cabinet office P45.,"" Eastwood, a member of the British parliament, said in a statement. 
""It tells you all you need to know about Boris Johnson's attitude to the North... Sacking the most successful Secretary of State in a decade shows Johnson's dangerous indifference to us.""
Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said on Twitter that while she may not have always agreed with Smith, ""his dedication to the role was incredible.""
Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, who co-chaired the negotiations, replied to Smith on Twitter to tell him that he had been ""such an effective Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at a time of real challenge and risk.""

""Without your leadership I don't believe Northern Ireland would have a government today. Thank you Julian Smith for your trust, friendship and courage,"" Coveney said.

Aisultan Nazarbayev, who now calls himself Aisultan Rakhat, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) he was already in Britain and he had fallen out with his grandfather and mother, Dariga Nazarbayeva, the speaker of Kazakhstan's upper house of parliament.
Aisultan Nazarbayev's Facebook updates have been erratic over the last few years and included a confession to being a former drug addict, an attempt to contact Nazarbayev's exiled political foe, discussions on religious topics and allegations against numerous members of the oil-rich nation's elite.
The 29-year-old Sandhurst graduate could not be reached for comment on Thursday. Dariga Nazarbayeva's press office declined to comment on the matter. Nursultan Nazarbayev's spokesman could not be reached for comment.
Nazarbayev, 79, resigned last March after running the former Soviet republic for almost 30 years, and endorsed his ally Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as successor, ensuring the latter's victory in a subsequent election.
Nazarbayev retains wide powers as the head of security council and the leader of the ruling Nur Otan party, and holds the official title of Yelbasy - the national leader."

SEOUL (Reuters) - The Red Cross called for an urgent exemption from sanctions on North Korea on Thursday to help prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus, following an epidemic in neighbouring China.
""We know that there is urgent need of personal protective gear and testing kits, items which will be vital to prepare for a possible outbreak,"" Xavier Castellanos, Asia Pacific director for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies (IFRC) said in a statement.
An exemption allowing for a bank transfer to the IFRC country office in North Korea ""is essential as a life-saving intervention,"" he added. ""There is currently no other mode available for humanitarian intervention and we must act now.""
International sanctions bar a wide range of business, trade, and other interactions with North Korea. The sanctions were imposed over the country’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, which were developed in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions.
North Korea has not confirmed any cases of the new coronavirus, but state media said the government was extending the quarantine period for people showing symptoms to 30 days, and all government institutions and foreigners living in the country were expected to comply ""unconditionally.""
Already one of the most closed-off countries in the world, North Korea has stopped airline flights and train service with its neighbours, established weeks-long mandatory quarantines for recently arrived foreigners, suspended international tourism, and imposed a near-complete lockdown on cross-border travel.
Some South Korean media outlets have reported multiple cases and possible deaths from the virus in North Korea, but World Health Organization officials based in Pyongyang told Voice of America that they have not been notified of any confirmed cases.
State media reported that North Korea's Red Cross Society had deployed to ""relevant areas"" around the country to conduct public education campaigns and to monitor people with possible symptoms.
""They are conducting information activities in various forms and by various methods at public places to introduce common medical knowledge about the epidemic and encourage people to give fuller play to the noble moral traits of helping and leading each other forward,"" state news agency KCNA reported.
According to the IFRC, its branch in North Korea had mobilised 500 volunteers, and was the only aid organisation with access to the four provinces closest to the border with China."

AHMEDABAD, India (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will be shielded from the sight of slums by a newly built wall when he visits the city of Ahmedabad during a visit to India this month.
A senior government said the wall was being built for security reasons, not to conceal the slum district.
But the contractor building it told Reuters the government ""did not want the slum to be seen"" when Trump passes by on the ride in from Ahmedabad's airport.
""I've been ordered to build a wall as soon as possible, over 150 masons are working round-the-clock to finish the project,"" the contractor said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The government official conceded that the wall was part of a ""beautification and cleanliness"" drive.
Whatever the reason, the 400-meter-long and seven-feet-high wall will prevent the U.S. leader from getting a glimpse of a slum district that houses an estimated 800 families.
Trump, who has made his pledge to build a wall along the United States' border with Mexico a feature of his presidency, will visit India on Feb. 24-25 to reaffirm strategic ties that have been buffeted by trade disputes.
He is expected to attend an event dubbed ""Kem Chho Trump"" (""How are you, Trump"") at a stadium in Ahmedabad along the lines of the ""Howdy Modi"" extravaganza he hosted for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Houston last September.
Speaking at the White House on Tuesday, Trump quoted Modi as saying ""millions and millions of people"" would attend the rally.
The event provides Trump, who was impeached in December, with the opportunity to woo the support of hundreds of thousands of Indian-American voters ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.
But some slum dwellers whose homes will be cordoned off by the wall in Ahmedabad - the largest city in Modi's home state of Gujarat - said the government was wasting tax-payer money to hide the poor.
""Poverty and slums are the reality of our life, but Modi's government wants to hide the poor,"" said Parvatbhai Mafabhai, a day worker who has lived there with his family for more than three decades."

SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (Reuters) - A cruise ship that spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by five countries over fears that someone aboard might have the coronavirus arrived in Cambodia on Thursday, to the relief of passengers and praise from global health officials. 
The MS Westerdam, carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew, could be seen from the docks of the Cambodian port town of Sihanoukville after anchoring offshore early in the morning.
People at the docks prepared to welcome passengers with bouquets of flowers, as embassy officials and Cambodian health authorities waited alongside journalists. 
""We've had so many near moments we thought we were going home only to be turned away,"" Angela Jones, an American tourist on board, told Reuters in a text message. ""This morning, just seeing land was such a breathtaking moment.""
Jones and her fellow passengers have spent almost two weeks at sea as several countries refused to let their ship dock.
The timing of their final journeys home was still uncertain, however, as the ship faces health checks by authorities and passengers need to be taken to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh to catch charter flights.
The ship's captain, Vincent Smit, initially told passengers in a letter that some could leave Cambodia as early as Friday, 
But in a later announcement, he said there could be delays because of the ""number of organizations and authorities"" supporting the operation to disembark, as well as the short notice given to Cambodia requesting permission to dock.
Local officials in Sihanoukville told reporters that chartered planes to take people from the port town to Phnom Penh were not ready yet, and the Westerdam had asked to delay disembarkation until Friday.
Passengers have had regular health checks during the troubled journey, said Holland America Line, the ship operator and a unit of Miami-based Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp. 
Cambodian health officials boarded the ship soon after it anchored. Later, a helicopter took off for Phnom Penh, carrying fluid samples from passengers for virus tests.
Although no one has fallen ill aboard, the ship was turned away by Guam, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand over fears that someone on board could have the new flu-like virus that has killed more than 1,300 people, almost all in China.
To while away the time and break up the monotony of endless ocean scrolling past cabin windows, the ship's crew organized dozens of activities, tourists on board told Reuters this week.
In a video address aboard the ship, Orlando Ashford, the president of Holland America Line, thanked passengers for their understanding in ""incredibly unusual and challenging circumstances"".
""I'm sure you'll have some good stories to tell when you reach your final destination home,"" Ashford said in a copy of the video seen by Reuters.
'INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY'
World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Cambodia.
""This is an example of international solidarity we have been consistently calling for,"" Tedros said ahead of the ship's arrival. ""Outbreaks can bring out the best and the worst in people.""
Stoking authorities' fears in countries on the ship's route has been the quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp. Of the 3,700 on that vessel, 175 tested positive for the virus.
On Tuesday, the Westerdam tried to dock in Bangkok but was denied permission by Thai authorities. On Wednesday, a Thai Navy warship escorted it out of the Gulf of Thailand, and it set course for Cambodia, the Marine Traffic website showed.
The U.S. ambassador to Cambodia said he had sent a team to help U.S. citizens with disembarking and continuing their journeys, and was coordinating with embassies of other nations.
Jones said she was still trying to understand how she had ended up on a fortnight-long cruise to nowhere:
""Thousands of travelers by air interacting with hundreds of people can land no problem but a cruise ship that made a one-day stop in Hong Kong almost two weeks ago is rejected by so many countries,"" she said.
""Still makes no sense"".

China's Human Resources Ministry announced on Thursday that Zhang Xiaoming would be removed as director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), to be replaced by Xia Baolong, a 67-year-old vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
Hong Kong has been roiled by more than seven months of protests over an extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial.
Zhang's removal follows Beijing's move in January to replace the head of its Hong Kong liaison office.
He will remain with the HKMAO as deputy director in charge of daily operations, the ministry said.
Xia served as Chinese President Xi Jinping's deputy when Xi was Communist Party secretary of Zhejiang province from 2003 to 2007.
""Xi now has his proteges in place over Hong Kong for the first time,"" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at the Hong Kong Baptist University.
""While that may give Hong Kong 'face', it is certainly going to put Hong Kong under more political pressure,"" Cabestan said.
A campaign in 2015 to tear down underground churches in Zhejiang gave Xia a reputation as a hard-liner.
""Xia is not a moderate and he has shown himself to be a zealous servant of Xi Jinping. We can expect that to continue,"" Cabestan said.
Zhang had backed the controversial extradition bill, telling a visiting Hong Kong delegation how urgent it was that Hong Kong pass the measure, Reuters reported in December.
The bill was scrapped after mass demonstrations, and the protests evolved into calls for greater democracy, posing the gravest popular challenge to Xi since he came to power.
Beijing also said on Thursday that it had appointed as deputy directors of the HKMAO Luo Huining, who became the new liaison office head in January, and Fu Ziying, the director of the Macau liaison office."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - China is threatening the sovereignty of small Pacific Islands and undermining the region's stability, a top U.S. military commander said on Thursday, in comments likely to inflame tension with China.
U.S.-China relations improved in January with the signing of a trade deal that defused an 18-month row that has hit global growth but strains remain.
Admiral Philip Davidson - commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command - said the United States ""was all in"" to counter China in the Pacific, citing its ""excessive territorial claims, debt trap diplomacy, violations of international agreements, theft of international property, military intimidation and outright corruption"".
""The Communist Party of China seeks to control the flow of trade, finance, communications, politics and the way of life in the Indo-Pacific,"" Davidson said in a speech in Sydney.
The Chinese embassy in Australia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China has in the past rejected accusations of aggressive behavior and of luring small economies into debt ""traps"".
China has been more active in the resource-rich Pacific in recent years, seeking to extend influence with aid and encouraging countries away from diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which China regards as renegade province with not right to state-to-state ties.
China's increasing assertiveness in the energy-rich South China Sea, in particular, has raised U.S. and regional concerns.
China claims most of the South China Sea, through which some $3.4 trillion in shipping passes each year. Countries including Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Brunei have over-lapping claims to parts of the sea.
Davidson's comments came at the end of a visit to old ally Australia, which included talks with Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
Australia, which long enjoyed unrivalled influence in the Pacific, has in recent years been more assertive in maintaining its standing in the region.
In 2018, it launched a A$3 billion fund to offer Pacific countries grants and cheap loans for infrastructure.
While vying for influence in the Pacific, Australia and China have also argued over Chinese activities in Australia.
In 2019, Australia concluded that China was responsible for a cyber-attack on its parliament and its three largest political parties - although it declined to publicize its findings amid concern of trade disruptions.
China denied responsibility.
China is Australia's largest trading partner, buying more than one-third of its total exports and sending more than a million tourists and students there each year.
""Beijing has showed a willingness to intervene in free markets and hurt Australian companies simply because the Australian government has exercised its sovereign right to exercise its national security,"" Davidson said."

(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Education said on Wednesday it has opened an investigation into whether the universities of Harvard and Yale failed to report hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign gifts and contracts as required by law.
Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, may not have reported at least $375 million in foreign money over the last four years, the department said in a statement.
""This is about transparency,"" U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said in the statement. ""If colleges and universities are accepting foreign money and gifts, their students, donors, and taxpayers deserve to know how much and from whom.""
Federal law requires most colleges and universities to report gifts from and contracts with foreign sources that are more than $250,000 twice a year.
Education department records over the last three decades show U.S. universities and colleges have reported more than $6.6 billion in donations from Qatar, China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
""This sum may be significantly underestimated,"" the education department said.
Yale received a request from the department on Tuesday for records of certain gifts and contracts from foreign sources under Section 117 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, said university spokeswoman Karen Peart.
""We are reviewing the request and preparing to respond to it,"" she said.
The education department said that it is also concerned that Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, lacked the proper controls over foreign money and may have not fully reported all donations and contracts coming from outside the United States.
Harvard did not respond to a request for comment.
The education department did not put a dollar amount of what Harvard potentially did not report.
Two weeks ago, Charles Lieber, the chair of Harvard University’s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, and two Chinese nationals who were researchers at Boston University and a Boston hospital were charged by the U.S. Justice Department with lying about their purported links to the Chinese government.
Lieber said that Harvard lacked adequate institutional controls for effective oversight and tracking of very large donations, according to the education department.
In a report about China's impact on U.S. education, a Senate committee on investigations described foreign spending on U.S. schools as “a black hole” because colleges and universities routinely fail to comply with the law."

The 177-year-old tower has been swathed in scaffolding for the past three years as craftsmen refurbish its stonework and famous 12-tonne clock.
Being able to get close to the 315-foot (96m) tower has allowed them to spot other problems like damage caused by pollution and asbestos.
The House of Commons and House of Lords Commissions said they had been told that to restore the tower to its previous splendor, the budget would need to rise from 61.1 million to 79.7 million pounds.
Ian Ailles, Director General of the House of Commons, said the task of restoring the tower had been more complex than anticipated.
“... understanding the full extent of the damage to the tower was impossible until the scaffolding was up,"" he said in a statement.
Among other problems, bomb damage inflicted on the tower during the Second World War had been found to be more extensive than first thought.
Although the tower survived Nazi bombing, its roof and dials were damaged in a May 1941 air raid which destroyed the main House of Commons chamber.
The latest refurbishment of the structure, during which its 13-tonne Big Ben bell has been largely silenced, is expected to be finished next year.
Work on the structure - renamed the Elizabeth Tower in 2012 - is separate from the planned full-scale restoration of the Palace of Westminster which has been estimated to cost 4 billion pounds and is due to start in the mid-2020s."

But this year, the job is just a little bit tougher - thanks to the new coronavirus that had spread to some 25 countries as of Wednesday.
""It's worrying because there a lot of people moving around and a lot of tourists coming into the country from all parts of the world,"" Patricia Guttman, a municipal health official, told Reuters.
Guttman said the city had freed up some 120 hospital beds that could be used for suspected coronavirus patients. Rio is already gearing up for the celebrations, which take place this year between Feb. 21 and Feb. 26.
During Carnival, hundreds of thousands of visitors parade through the sweltering seaside streets of Rio. In practice, many of the celebrations often include a dearth of clothing and a surplus of alcohol, creating a ripe environment for contagious disease.
So far, South America has not had any confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus. Thirty four Brazilians evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, are being held in quarantine at a military base.
On Wednesday, Rio health workers received training on how to identify a potential carrier of the virus. They also practiced quickly applying face masks to potential patients, while themselves slipping into protective plastic suits.
City officials insist they are prepared.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he did not mind Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's decision to end a decades-old military agreement with the United States, a position at odds with that of his defense secretary who viewed the move with dismay.
Duterte on Tuesday announced termination of the two-decade-old Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper called the decision ""unfortunate"" as Washington and its allies press China to abide by ""international rules"" in Asia. [L4N2AB0ZL]
The U.S. embassy in Manila called it ""a serious step with significant implications."" Duterte's decision, sparked by the revocation of a U.S. visa held by a former police chief who led Duterte's bloody war on drugs, takes legal effect in 180 days and U.S. officials have expressed hope it can be reversed or delayed.
""I don't really mind if they would like to do that, it will save a lot of money,"" Trump told reporters at the White House when asked about Duterte's move and whether anything could be done to get him to reconsider. ""My views are different from others,"" he added.
Trump has frequently expressed a desire to bring U.S. military forces home from decades-long deployments abroad and has strong-armed some allies into paying more for the right to U.S. defense.
Trump said the United States had helped the Philippines defeat Islamic State militants. He said he had ""a very good"" relationship with Duterte and added: ""we'll see what happens.""
Duterte's decision could complicate U.S. military interests in the broader Asia-Pacific region as China's ambitions rise. Some Filipino senators quickly sought to block the move, arguing Duterte had no right to unilaterally scrap international pacts the country's senate had ratified.
The VFA is important to the overall U.S.-Philippines alliance and sets out rules for U.S. soldiers operating in the Philippines, a former U.S. territory. Washington has called the relationship ""ironclad,"" despite Duterte's complaints that include allegations of U.S. hypocrisy and ill treatment.
Ending the VFA complicates Washington's efforts to maintain an Asia-Pacific troop presence amid friction over the presence of U.S. personnel in Japan and South Korea and security concerns about China and North Korea.
Esper referred to the period before Duterte's decision takes effect when speaking to reporters on Tuesday.
""One hundred and eighty days. We've got to work through it, and we'll just take a deep breath and take it one day at a time ... I don't get too excited about these things. We've got a process we have to work through.""
Some lawmakers in the Philippines are concerned that without the VFA, two other pacts that make up the long-standing U.S. alliance with Manila would be irrelevant, namely the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement made under the Obama administration, and a 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty.

Supporters of the agreements say they have helped deter Chinese militarization in the South China Sea and $1.3 billion of U.S. defense assistance since 1998 has been vital in boosting the capabilities of under-resourced Philippine forces.

1098,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 05:02PM ET</span>","IMF says Lebanon requests technical help on economy, debt","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon on Wednesday formally requested the International Monetary Fund's technical help in shoring up its economy, a move that a senior government source said would include the fund's aid in drafting a plan to avert financial collapse.
As Lebanon's government grapples with an economic crisis that has fueled increasingly violent protests, the heavily indebted country must urgently decide on how to deal with fast-approaching debt payments, including a $1.2 billion Eurobond due on March 9.
""We have recently received a request from the Lebanese authorities to offer advice and technical expertise on the macroeconomic challenges facing the economy,"" IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said in a statement.
He said the IMF regularly provides advice to its member countries on policies and reforms to restore economic stability and promote growth. The IMF statement made no mention of financial assistance for Lebanon.
""Any decisions on debt are the authorities', to be made in consultation with their own legal and financial advisers,"" Rice added. 
As part of the request, the senior government source said Lebanon asked the IMF to send a team to Beirut to help draw up a comprehensive plan to avoid default.
The financial crisis, worse than any Lebanon endured in its 1975-90 civil war, came to a head last year as slowing capital inflows led to a liquidity crunch and demonstrations erupted against the ruling elite. 
Deciding how to handle Lebanon's next sovereign debt maturity is a top priority for Prime Minister Hassan Diab's government, which won a vote of confidence in Parliament on Tuesday.
The IMF technical team is expected to arrive in Beirut in the next few days to help draw up an economic, financial and monetary plan, said the senior government source, adding that the request for help was made by phone on Wednesday.
It was not immediately clear whether the technical assistance would involve a plan for debt restructuring. Some politicians have expressed support for consulting the IMF before any plan is put forward to manage the debt payments.
A decision on the March Eurobond was expected in Beirut on Thursday at a meeting between the president, central bank governor, finance minister and others, a second government source said.
Lebanon was seeking advice on the March Eurobond ""amid concerns that any reprofiling of Lebanon's debt should be conducted in an orderly way to avoid damaging the country's banking system,"" the second government source said. 
Lebanese banks holding the bulk of the sovereign debt have piled pressure on the state to pay the March Eurobond on time. The banks have in recent months imposed tough controls on hard currency amid dwindling reserves and fears of capital flight.
In London, two of Lebanon's international corporate creditors, Greylock Capital and Mangart Advisors, said they and others had organized an ""informal discussion group"" to begin evaluating options. 
Another source familiar with the matter said that ""since the government gave the nod for IMF technical help, the general mood is toward doing an orderly restructuring"".
""The feeling here is that the government would like a restructuring - not to pay - and to set terms on how to pay and when to pay,"" a fourth source familiar with the matter said.
Senior political sources said the major parties that back the Diab government, notably the heavily armed Hezbollah, favored reaching a deal to avoid paying the debt as Lebanon needed its foreign currency to pay for essential imports.
DECADES OF CORRUPTION
The crisis is rooted in decades of state corruption and bad governance that have landed Lebanon with one of the world's heaviest public debt burdens.
The banking association said it was necessary to repay the Eurobond on time to maintain Lebanon's place and relationships in global financial markets. It said the short time remaining before the March 9 maturity did not allow for preparation and ""competent handling"", and called for the public debt to be tackled right after the March payment.
Diab on Tuesday described the government's task as a ""suicide mission"". The priority would be preserving foreign currency reserves for critical imports, and ""all possibilities"" were under study for dealing with Eurobonds maturing this year.

Even as it seeks IMF technical help, comments attributed to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri this week indicated Lebanon's opposition to a full IMF program, whose tough conditions the country would not be able to bear.

Since January 2019, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has sent migrants, mostly from Central America, to Mexico under a policy called Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), which is also known as Remain in Mexico.
The policy has been a key element of Trump's push to curb irregular immigration and asylum claims in the United States.
""The numbers...show a significant fall,"" Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told a news conference.
Mexico's foreign ministry said about 2,000 migrants were sent to Mexico under the program in January, down from a peak of around 12,000 in August last year. The ministry said it expected the number of returns would continue to fall in February.
Earlier, Ebrard said the number of people awaiting a U.S. hearing in Mexico had at one point reached up to 50,000 people per month.
However, according to U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data through January, a total of about 57,000 non-Mexican migrants have been returned since MPP started about a year ago.
The department has not released the number of migrants still pursuing their cases from Mexico or a monthly breakdown of returns. Mexico has not released data on how many returnees remain in the country.
Helen Perry, a nurse from the nonprofit organization Global Response Management who provides care to migrants in the Mexican border town of Matamoros, said her organization has done informal surveys and found more than 2,500 migrants likely waiting for U.S. hearings in that one city alone.
Rogelio Pinal, head if the city human rights office in Ciudad Juarez said approximately 15,000 MPP migrants are currently living in Ciudad Juarez.
Many migrants have to wait for weeks or months in Mexico to complete the long U.S. court process, due to backlogs.
Ebrard added that the number of migrant crossings at the shared border between the United States and Mexico has declined by about 75% over the past eight months."

The Netherlands is leading an investigation into MH17 being shot down on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people on board. Two-thirds of the passengers were Dutch. The plane was flying over territory held by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine on a journey to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam.
Dutch Minister of Justice Ferd Grapperhaus, in a letter to parliament about the progress of the case, said Russia made the request last October.
""The justice minister answered that the transfer of prosecution of the three Russian suspects was not an option for the Dutch authorities and will not be considered,"" the letter said.
Investigators say the missile that hit the airline came from a launcher transported from a Russian military base in Kursk, just across the border.
Moscow denies wrongdoing. Russia does not extradite its own citizens, so none of Russian suspects are expected to appear in a Dutch court. However, a Dutch law firm has said that one of the Russian suspects in the case has asked it to represent him."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO defense ministers agreed on Wednesday to expand the Western alliance's training mission in Iraq, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said, responding to a demand by U.S. President Donald Trump for NATO to do more in the Middle East.
NATO will take over some of the training activities carried out by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, Stoltenberg said, meaning the decision does not require more Western troops in Iraq but would be with the consent of the Iraqi government.
""Today, allied ministers...agreed in principle to enhance NATO's training mission,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference. ""In the first instance, this will consist of taking on some of the global coalition's current training activities.""
NATO and the coalition have non-combat, ""train-and-advise"" missions that aim to develop Iraqi security forces, but both are suspended over fears for regional stability after a U.S. drone strike killed a top Iranian commander in Baghdad on Jan. 3.
After the killing, Trump called on NATO - founded in 1949 to contain a military threat from the Soviet Union - to do more in the Middle East, without specifying what that might entail.
Stoltenberg said the NATO Iraq mission would restart as soon as possible. He declined to give more details. He also said there had been no decision on how many troops would be re-assigned from the U.S.-led coalition.
NATO diplomats told Reuters the coalition troops could likely move across and work under a NATO flag from the middle of 2020 now that the political decision has been taken.
NATO ministers, including U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, will also discuss more options for the alliance in the Middle East in a bid to mollify Trump, a sharp critic who has accused some allies of being ""delinquent"" because they do not spend enough on defense. 
""Ministers also agreed to explore what more we can do beyond this first step,"" Stoltenberg said.
However, many allies say they refuse to join the U.S. maximum pressure campaign against Iran, for instance. 
Eastern European allies, fearful of Russia since Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea, are concerned about shifting too many resources to the Middle East or for NATO to be used as a way for the United States to pull out of the region, diplomats said.

Juan Jose Marquez, who was with Guaido on his return to Venezuela after a three-week international tour, passed ""migration normally, and as he was about to leave ... he was held for an alleged Seniat review,"" Guaido's press team wrote on Twitter. Seniat is Venezuela's national tax agency.
At the airport, Guaido was met by a throng of supporters as well as pro-government agitators who pushed and shouted insults at him and attacked journalists, photographers and opposition lawmakers there, according to Reuters witnesses.
""It retains a member of my family ... the cowardly dictatorship,"" Guaido told reporters when he arrived at a square in eastern Caracas where the National Assembly, dominated by the opposition, was about to begin a session.
As Maduro ""is a coward (...) who does not show his face, who does not dare to step in a public square without security (...) he mounts an attack against my family,"" he added.
Romina Botaro, Marquez's wife who arrived to the plaza with Guaido, said her husband was an airplane pilot who had nothing to do with politics.
""Like any protective uncle, he wanted to accompany his nephew's return to the country,"" Botaro added. She said the family does not know Marquez's whereabouts.
The Ministry of Communication did not respond to a request for comment.
Upon arrival in Venezuela, Guaido said pressure against Maduro's government will increase because the country ""bleeds out"" and must be ""saved.""
Guaido, who is recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela's legitimate president, hopes to revive the inertia of 2019 when he led a groundswell of protests against Maduro.
Venezuela's economic collapse under Maduro has prompted nearly 5 million people to emigrate, creating a migration crisis in nearby Latin American nations.
Maduro calls Guaido a U.S-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup.

BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China reported on Wednesday its lowest number of new coronavirus cases in two weeks, bolstering a forecast by Beijing's senior medical adviser for the outbreak there to end by April, but U.N. health authorities warned it could still ""go in any direction"".
The 2,015 new confirmed cases took China's total to 44,653. That was the lowest daily rise since Jan. 30 and came a day after epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan said the epidemic should peak in China this month before subsiding.
His comments helped soothe public fears and markets, where global stocks surged to record highs on hopes of an end to disruption in the world's second largest economy. [MKTS/GLOB] 
But the World Health Organization has likened the epidemic's threat to terrorism and WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that the apparent slowdown in the spread of the epidemic should be viewed with ""extreme caution"".
""This outbreak could still go in any direction,"" he told a briefing in Geneva.
Another expert said that while the coronavirus may be peaking in China, this was not the case beyond. 
""It has spread to other places where it's the beginning of the outbreak,"" Dale Fisher, head of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the WHO, said in an interview in Singapore. ""In Singapore, we are at the beginning.""
Singapore has 50 cases, including one found at its biggest bank, DBS (SI:DBSM), on Wednesday that caused an evacuation at head office.
Hundreds of infections have been reported in dozens of other countries and territories, but only two people have died outside mainland China: one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.
China's latest figures also showed the number of deaths on the mainland rose by 97 to 1,113 by the end of Tuesday, though doubts have been aired on social media about how reliable the data is. 
After a two-day WHO meeting in Geneva on research and innovation into measures to tackle the new viral outbreak, Tedros welcomed the energy and enthusiasm of participating scientists.
He said a WHO-led advance team that travelled to China this week had made good progress on the composition and scope of its work.
The head of the WHO's emergency programme, Dr Mike Ryan, said it was too early ""to predict the beginning, the middle or end of the epidemic"".
QUARANTINED CRUISES
The biggest cluster outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off the Japanese port of Yokohama, with about 3,700 people on board, of whom 175 have tested positive.
The ship's operator is among foreign companies taking a hit from the outbreak, with many flights suspended and businesses disrupted. 
Planemaker Boeing (N:BA) said airlines were facing a fall in profits as the crisis reduces passenger demand and prolongs weakness in economically sensitive air freight.
Global ship deliveries have also been dented as yards in China, one of the biggest shipbuilders, struggle to get fully back to work. 
There was a happy ending in sight for another cruise ship, the MS Westerdam, which Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines had refused to let dock over fears one of its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew might have the virus.
Cambodia agreed to let it land, the Holland America Line said. 
China's state news agency Xinhua called the epidemic a ""battle that has no gunpowder smoke"" and chided some officials for ""dropping the ball"" in some places.
The outbreak has been named COVID-19 - CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for the year that it emerged. It is suspected to have originated in a market illegally trading wildlife in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan in December.
The city of 11 million people remains under virtual lockdown. 
'RACIST REPORTING'?
Moves by Washington and others to curb visitors from China have offended Beijing, which says they are an over-reaction.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has also reared on social media.
A Xinhua commentary chided some Western media for ""racist reporting"" on the coronavirus and ignoring ""the unswerving efforts and huge sacrifice China and its people have made"".
""Just as the H1N1 influenza outbreak in the United States in 2009 should not be called an 'American virus', the NCP (novel coronavirus pneumonia) is neither a 'China virus' nor 'Wuhan virus',"" it said, in a reference to the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
With companies laying off workers and supply chains from the car industry to smartphones disrupted, China's economy is taking a big hit. ANZ Bank said first quarter growth may slow to between 3.2-4.0%, down from a projection of 5.0%.
The latest big event to be cancelled was Formula One's Chinese Grand Prix, originally set for Shanghai on April 19.
The 2020 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona has also been cancelled over coronavirus fears, after several European companies pulled out of the telecoms conference.

1105,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 02:13PM ET</span>","Russia accuses Turkey of breaking Syria deals, rejects Erdogan claim","By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Wednesday accused Turkey of flouting agreements it had made with Moscow on Syria and of aggravating the situation in Idlib where Syrian forces have made gains in their campaign to eliminate the last insurgent bastion in a nine-year-old war.
That offensive has fueled violence in Idlib, in northwest Syria and bordering Turkey, forcing thousands of civilians to flee and drawing in the Turkish military which has seen 13 of its soldiers killed by Syrian shelling in the last 10 days.
In one of the strongest signs yet that Syria is placing relations between Moscow, which backs the Syrian government, and Ankara, which backs Syrian anti-government rebels, under increasing strain, the Kremlin, the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian Defense Ministry all accused Turkey of bad faith.
The Kremlin said Turkey had failed to deliver on a promise to neutralize militants in Idlib, something it called unacceptable, the Foreign Ministry reminded Ankara its forces were in Syria without the blessing of the Syrian government, and the Defense Ministry said Turkish troops were seriously aggravating the situation on the ground in Idlib.
The Defense Ministry also flatly rejected an allegation made by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan who said Russian forces and Iran-backed militias were ""constantly attacking the civilian people, carrying out massacres, spilling blood"".
'NON-FULFILMENT'
""Statements by Turkish representatives about alleged attacks by Russian forces on civilians in the Idlib de-escalation zone do not correspond with reality,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.
""The real reason for the crisis in the Idlib de-escalation zone unfortunately is the non-fulfilment by our Turkish colleagues of their undertakings to separate moderate opposition militants from terrorists.""
It said the presence of Turkish troops and armor in Idlib was making the situation there much worse, as was the transport of weapons and ammunition across the Syrian-Turkish border.
Russia took issue with Turkey after Erdogan said his military would strike Syrian forces by air or ground anywhere in Syria if another Turkish soldier was hurt as the Syrian government fought to regain control of Idlib.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow remained committed to a deal on Syria it had struck with Ankara, but that Russia considered militant attacks in Idlib to be unacceptable and in contravention of that same agreement.
Russia, a close ally of the Syrian government, hashed out a deal with Turkey in 2018 to create a de-militarized zone in Idlib, but those agreements and others between the two countries have come under strain amid mounting tensions in the region.
""In particular, according to this document (the agreement), the Turkish side undertook to ensure that terrorist groups in Idlib were neutralized,"" said Peskov.
""We continue to note with regret that these groups are carrying out strikes from Idlib on Syrian forces and also taking aggressive action against our military facilities,"" Peskov told reporters.
""This is unacceptable."""

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan will continue to subsidize bread prices during transitional rule after Omar al-Bashir's ouster but wants to achieve ""justice"" in distributing income supports, its trade and industry minister said on Wednesday.
Bread shortages, caused by difficulties in raising hard currency to import wheat, triggered mass protests which - with the help of the military - toppled the veteran autocrat last April after three decades in power.
The new civilian government, ruling together with the armed forces for three years and three months, has been trying to address bread and fuel shortages that have led to lengthy queues outside bakeries and petrol stations.
The bread queues are caused at least in part by problems in ensuring supplies of subsidized flour to bakeries.
Trade and Industry Minister Madani Abbas Madani told reporters Sudan had sufficient wheat reserves until May and was in talks for deals to ensure enough stocks until year-end.
""The state is committed to subsidizing bread during the transition period, but aims to ensure justice in distributing the subsidies,"" Madani said.
He added that within 45 days the government would also launch commercial bakeries which will sell non-subsidized bread drawing on commercial stocks.
He said the Khartoum government ultimately aimed to shift from subsidizing wheat to subsidizing bread, but that this required ""infrastructure arrangements"".
That could allow bakeries to sell bread for more than the current fixed price of one Sudanese pound per loaf (2 U.S. cents at the official rate, or 1 U.S. cent on the parallel market) which has made it hard for bakeries to make money.
During the recent bread crisis, ""resistance committees"" have kept watch at bakeries to monitor supplies and crack down on what they say is corruption and leakages of subsidized flour.
From next week an electronic monitoring system will be introduced to track supplies and a hotline established for people to report malpractices, Madani said.
He said a newly formed police unit would be deployed to monitor flour and bread trade, alongside the resistance committees.
It was not immediately clear whether the new commercial bakeries would ease the burden on a government budget that is also subsidizing fuel and other basic products in the widely impoverished country. Sudan currently spends about $65,000 per day on wheat, according to the trade ministry.
Sudan lost about 75% of its oil wealth, a major hard-currency source, when South Sudan declared independence in 2011.
Officials said on Wednesday that a problem with a refinery pipeline that was the main cause of fuel shortages over the past week had been fixed."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer will meet contenders to replace her as Christian Democrat (CDU) leader next week, she told Reuters on Wednesday, forging ahead with the succession process after senior party figures pressed for a swift decision.
Kramp-Karrenbauer gave up her ambitions of succeeding Chancellor Angela Merkel, her mentor, on Monday - a move that raised questions over the future of the conservatives' coalition with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD).
The CDU must now embark on finding a new leader and chancellor candidate for the next federal election, due by October 2021, to avoid leaving the world's fourth biggest economy and the European Union's leading power in a state of political limbo.
On Monday, Kramp-Karrenbauer said she would organize a process to fill both the party chief and chancellor candidate roles in the summer. But senior CDU party members, fearing a vacuum, have since pressed her to accelerate that timetable.
""We will start the personnel selection process next week. I have invited those whose names are currently circulating for one-on-one interviews,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer said in a television interview.
""At the moment, there are three names circulating in public. Whether more come forward, and what gender they are, we will see,"" she said.
Kramp-Karrenbauer's erstwhile rivals for the party leadership - Friedrich Merz and Jens Spahn - and Armin Laschet, premier of Germany's most populous state and a Merkel ally, have been widely discussed in German media as the most likely contenders.
A source close to Merz said on Wednesday he planned to seek the party leadership.
Both Merz and Spahn are clearly to the right of the centrist, consensus-seeking Merkel and, if one of them wins and seeks to sharpen the CDU's profile before the next election, he might put pressure on her to step aside early. 
That thought prompted the Social Democrats on Wednesday to say they could quit as junior coalition partner if Merkel is forced out as chancellor.
""PARTY OF THE MIDDLE""
Kramp-Karrenbauer pointedly said that ""the CDU has always been a party of the middle ... As long as I can make a contribution to the CDU, I will fight for this course"".
A decision on the succession could come before the summer recess. ""I brought up the summer break in the executive committee,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer she said, adding that the speed of the process depended partly on talks with the contenders next week.
Resolving the succession issue by the summer would allow the government to take up its presidency of the European Union in the second half of the year without the leadership question hanging over it.
Arguing that Europe needed a ""capable and stable Germany"", Kramp-Karrenbauer said Merkel and her government were pushing on with preparations for Germany's six-month presidency of the EU, starting in July.
""We are now making a decision that is important for the CDU,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer said, stressing that she believed the party chair and chancellor candidate should be the same person. ""Whatever the SPD takes from that is its business.""
Kramp-Karrenbauer succeeded Merkel as leader of their CDU in December 2018, but struggled to stamp her mark on the party.
A series of gaffes eroded her authority, and her inability last week to impose discipline on the CDU in the eastern state of Thuringia - where the regional party sided with the far-right Alternative for Germany to elect a state leader - dealt a final blow to her credibility.

Putin's approval rating dropped sharply following an unpopular move to raise the pension age in 2018 and years of falling incomes, but it has stabilized in recent months and risen slightly to 68%, according to the pollster.
Despite that recovery, however, the public's trust in Putin has continued to recede and in January it hit 35%, a sharp drop from 59% recorded in November 2017, according to Levada.
Denis Volkov, a sociologist at the pollster, said the level in January was the lowest it has been since before Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 prompted Putin's ratings to surge.
Putin has dominated Russia's political landscape as president or prime minister since he came to power in 1999.
His current term in the Kremlin ends in 2024, but he announced sweeping constitutional changes last month that are widely seen as being designed to help him extend his grip on power after he leaves office.
Levada said the poll was conducted on Jan. 23-29. A total of 1,603 people were polled across Russia.
Volkov said the mixed poll results showed that Russians approved overall with Putin, but that there is also some feeling of fatigue with him as a political figure.
""It's a situation when they approve of him, but the significance of Putin as a figure is falling. He's not seen as irreplaceable and so on, but they approve of his work,"" he said."

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights office issued a report on Wednesday on companies it said have business ties to Israeli settlements in the West Bank, drawing ire from Israel but winning praise from Palestinians.
It said it had identified 112 business entities which it has reasonable grounds to conclude have ties with Israeli settlements - 94 domiciled in Israel and 18 in six other countries including the United States, Britain and France.
Inclusion on the list has no immediate legal implications for the companies. Though Palestinians and much of the world view the settlements as illegal under international law, the United States and Israel dispute this.
But the issue is highly sensitive as companies named could be targeted for boycotts or divestment aimed at stepping up pressure on Israel over its West Bank settlements.
""I am conscious this issue has been, and will continue to be, highly contentious,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said in a statement.
Bachelet's office said the report ""does not provide a legal characterization of the activities in question, or of business enterprises’ involvement in them."" 
Her spokesman, Rupert Colville, said in videotaped remarks made available to reporters that work on the report involved extensive cross-checking and use of company annual reports. 
He said it was ""not a blacklist, nor does it qualify any companies' activities as illegal"".
There was no immediate reaction by the United States, Israel's main ally, but Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called the report a ""shameful capitulation"" to anti-Israel groups.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made clear he considered the U.S. government's position on settlements under President Donald Trump as more important than the views of U.N. organizations. 
""We will ensure the (U.S.) recognition of our sovereignty over those settlements - that will cancel out the entire impact of the United Nations because the United States is more important than the U.N."", he told Army Radio.
Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki welcomed the report as a ""victory for international law"" and urged U.N. member states to issue instructions to the companies listed ""to end their work immediately with the settlement system"".
""COMPANIES ON NOTICE""
Human rights groups also broadly welcomed the report. Bruno Stagno, deputy executive director for advocacy at Human Rights Watch said in a statement the report ""should put all companies on notice: to do business with illegal settlements is to aid in the commission of war crimes.""
Israel captured the West Bank in a 1967 war. Palestinians deem the settlements, and the military presence needed to protect them, to be obstacles to their goal of establishing a state. Israel disputes this.
The United States in effect backed Israel's right to build Jewish settlements on Nov. 18 last year by abandoning its long-held position that they were ""inconsistent with international law"".
The report was issued on the eve of the U.N. Human Rights Council's main annual session opening in Geneva from Feb 24. Neither Israel nor the United States are members of the forum which both accuse of a bias against Israel.
None of the companies named made any immediate comment on their inclusion on the list.
Home-rental company Airbnb, which was included on the list, had already acknowledged having listings in settlements and said last April that it would donate proceeds from any bookings in the territory to international humanitarian aid organizations.

TBILISI (Reuters) - The European Union and the United States urged Georgia to reinforce democracy on Wednesday after an opposition leader was jailed for a second time in a case activists say is politically motivated.
Gigi Ugulava, one of the leaders of the European Georgia party, was sentenced by the Supreme Court on Monday to 38 months in jail on charges of misusing public funds while mayor of Tbilisi, his second conviction on similar charges.
Criminal cases have been opened against other opposition leaders amid mass protests against the government and the ruling Georgian Dream party that began last summer.
Following Monday's Supreme Court ruling, opposition parties decided to cease talks with the ruling party on electoral reform aimed at ending their standoff. The opposition says it will resume mass protests soon.
The European Union said it was scrutinizing the Supreme Court ruling against Ugulava closely.
""The circumstances around this verdict are not conducive to advancing the political dialogue aimed at a much needed depolarization of the political situation in Georgia,"" the EU mission in Georgia said in a statement. 
The South Caucasus country, which serves as a transit route for Caspian Sea oil and gas, was widely praised for establishing democratic institutions in the post-Soviet era. 
But human rights watchdogs have criticized the current government over a lack of progress on judicial reform and for putting pressure on independent media.
Ugulava was first imprisoned for a similar offense in September 2015, for four-and-a-half years, but was freed in January 2017 after his sentence was reduced.
Mayor of Tbilisi from 2005-2013 and now one of Georgia's most active opposition leaders, he was sentenced again in 2018, to 15 months in prison, in the same case, but his sentence was considered to have been served.
U.S. senators and congressmen have written to the Georgian government since December expressing concerns over level of democracy in the former Soviet republic of 3.7 million people.
""The U.S. Embassy is disappointed that the timing and context of the conviction and sentencing of an opposition leader ... has put the dialogue at risk,"" the Embassy said.
""An environment conducive to the successful continuation of the dialogue requires an independent, transparent judicial system free of political influence,"" its statement said.
The ruling Georgian Dream party, led by Georgia's richest man Bidzina Ivanishvili, faces parliamentary elections this year. Opponents accuse him of ruling the country from behind the scenes despite having no formal role in government.

Bashir, also accused of crimes against humanity in Darfur, has been jailed in Khartoum since he was toppled after mass protests last year. Another four Sudanese suspects are wanted by the ICC on charges related to atrocities in the Darfur region.
Human Rights Watch director Kenneth Roth said he had met the head of Sudan's ruling council, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.
""...He was very clear about the government's willingness to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Court,"" Roth told Reuters in a phone interview from Khartoum where he had meetings with Burhan and Sudan's prime minister.
On Tuesday, Sudan's government and rebel groups in Darfur agreed that all those wanted by the ICC should appear before the tribunal.
The agreement is part of talks between Sudan's new government and rebels in Darfur and other neglected regions to try to broker a peace agreement after years of conflict.
Some observers noted that while the civilian members of Sudan's ruling council might back ICC cooperation it was unclear if the military members would. But Roth said Burhan was unconditional in his support for the move.
""We were not sure how the meeting with the general was going to go but he completely reaffirmed what we heard from the other government officials,"" Roth said, adding that it still unsure what form cooperation would take.
""He pledged full cooperation. Obviously it's an open question if that means surrendering Bashir and the other four to The Hague or does that mean cooperating with the ICC to have strong, fair domestic prosecutions?"" he said.
The ICC is meant to step in only if states are unwilling or unable to prosecute alleged crimes themselves.
Human Rights Watch warned that while their meetings with Burhan and Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok were very positive, it was early days yet and ""these are just words, not actions""."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday urged those blocking rail lines in protest against the construction of a natural gas pipeline to find a quick solution, as police warned they were ready to step in and end the standoff.
Anti-pipeline protesters near tracks in Ontario, Canada's most populated province, disrupted passenger trains and goods transportation for a sixth straight day on Wednesday.
The Ontario blockade of the Canadian National Railway (CN) line is in support of Wet’suwet’en Nation's opposition to the proposed Coastal GasLink pipeline in British Columbia. Ontario police on Tuesday warned they had a court injunction ordering that the area to be cleared.
Trudeau, during an official visit to Senegal, said that while peaceful protest is a fundamental part of Canada's democracy, the rule of law must be respected.
""That's why I am encouraging all parties to dialogue to resolve this as quickly as possible,"" he said in Dakar at a news briefing televised by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
The protests against the pipeline have turned into a flashpoint for Indigenous rights demonstrators. Trudeau has said it is a priority for his government to repair relations with First Nations and to champion Indigenous rights.
The C$6.6 billion ($4.97 billion) pipeline at the heart of the dispute would move natural gas from northeastern British Columbia to the Pacific Coast, where the Royal Dutch Shell-led LNG Canada export facility is under construction. The pipeline will be operated by TC Energy Corp.

The men, including two Baring Vostok executives, were detained a year ago along with their colleagues, U.S. investor Michael Calvey and French national Philippe Delpal.
All five deny wrongdoing and say the charges against them are being used to pressure them in a business dispute over control of mid-sized bank Vostochny.
The case has rattled Russia's business community and prompted several prominent officials and businessmen to voice concerns about the treatment of the executives. Calvey and Delpal were both moved to house arrest last year.
Baring Vostok's supporters in the case clapped in the courtroom on Wednesday as the court ruled to move executives Vagan Abgaryan and Ivan Zyuzin, and Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM) Vladimirov to house arrest until April 12, RIA reported."

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya's deputy president pledged to unite the country in honor of Daniel Arap Moi, its longest-ruling president, who was buried at his sprawling estate in the Rift Valley on Wednesday. 
Moi, who died last week at 95, won praise for keeping Kenya mostly stable during his 24-year rule but criticism for a legacy of corruption that still haunts the East African nation to date.
His coffin was flown by military helicopter early in the morning to the estate, some 185 km northwest of Nairobi, before it was transferred by a gun carriage into a large tent for a religious service and speeches by politicians.
Deputy President William Ruto told the mourners that Moi had worked to ensure that the vast Rift Valley region was home to all of Kenya's 45 ethnic communities, which have periodically been riven by bitter divisions over land and politics.
""Rift Valley will continue to be the valley of peace, and from the valley, we will continue to build so that it is the fountain of politics of uniting Kenya and all communities in our country,"" said Ruto, who also hails from the region.
""Moi taught us that hate is big burden to carry, and told us tribalism is stupidity; let us not give stupidity a chance. That is why we are going to be steadfast and firm in ensuring that our great country shall continue to be knit together.""
The Rift Valley, rich with fertile land used to produce tea and other commodities, has been the epicenter of election violence. 
Tribal clashes broke out there during the 1992 and 1997 elections, as Moi's Kalenjin tribe sought to kick out opposition supporters who were perceived as outsiders because they had settled there after independence from Britain in 1963.
Violence flared again during the 2007 presidential election campaign and Ruto himself was accused of being behind it. He was charged at the International Criminal Court at The Hague before the court dropped the charges later.
Moi came to power in 1978 when he was serving as vice-president, after the nation's first leader President Jomo Kenyatta died.
During his rule, thousands of activists, students and academics were held without charge in underground cells. Prisoners say they were sometimes denied food and water.
Poverty also deepened on his watch and corruption flourished. A 2004 report by corporate investigations firm group Kroll accused Moi and his inner circle of stealing $2 billion of state funds, an accusation the government at the time dismissed.
Officers from the Kenyan navy fired a 19-gun salute in tribute to Moi, before his body was lowered into a grave next to his wife who died in 2004.

But it is still not clear whether superyacht M.V. Luna, impounded in 2018, will be able to depart Dubai after a British court's freezing order was dismissed on Feb. 5.
Oil and gas tycoon Farkhad Akhmedov was ordered to pay about 40% of his fortune to his former wife Tatiana Akmedova by London's High Court in 2016, in one of the largest divorce settlements in legal history.
But he failed to pay the 453 million pound ($588 million)divorce bill and the London court granted a worldwide freezing order, under which Akhmedov's yacht was impounded in the Gulf Arab emirate.
A spokesman for Tatiana Akhmedova, who is trying to enforce the freezing order, said an injunction from the Marshall Islands prevents the yacht from setting sail.
The vessel was still moored on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv ship tracking data.
Luna, an expedition yacht built for Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich before Akhmedov bought it in 2014, has at least nine decks, space for 50 crew, two helipads, a vast swimming pool and a mini-submarine.
The Dubai court of appeal's final decision, English and Arabic copies of which were provided to Reuters by Akhmedov's spokesman, came after two years of legal battles in the emirate over the freezing order. 
Lawyers acting for Akhmedova said on Wednesday they would not comment on possible next steps until they assess the reasons for the court ruling, but said the yacht still could not sail. 
""An injunction imposed by the Marshall Islands authority, the flag state of the yacht, prevents it from doing so. That injunction has never been challenged and demonstrates the undoubted rights of [her] position,"" said the lawyers' statement, provided by the spokesman. 
Akhmedova began divorce proceedings in Britain in 2012. Akhmedov said he and his wife had already divorced in Russia in 2000, but various Russian and British courts have found no evidence to support this assertion.
Akhmedova is using London-listed litigation funder Burford capital. Burford did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Forbes estimates Akhmedov's net worth at $1.4 billion. The U.S. Treasury Department has put him on a list of sanctioned Russian state-owned companies and so-called ""oligarchs"", identified as close to President Vladimir Putin.

The result of the vote is due to be formally announced around 1800 GMT but a Reuters tally of the count showed a majority in favor of removing Salvini's legal protection as a former minister.
The decision gives magistrates in Sicily the go-ahead to press charges over his decision to keep 131 rescued migrants blocked aboard a coastguard ship for six days last July as he waited for other European Union states to agree to take them in.
Salvini, the head of Italy's League party who was serving as interior minister at the time, could eventually face up to 15 years in jail if found guilty at the end of Italy's tortuous legal process. Conviction could also bar him from political office, dashing his ambitions to lead a future government."

Kurti's predecessor, Ramush Haradinaj, doubled his salary two years ago from 1,500 euros ($1,637) to 2,950 euros, a move that drew strong criticism in a country where one third of the population is unemployed. His ministers also got big pay increases.
""I propose to undo the (previous) government decision and for salaries (of ministers) to return to where they were before,"" Kurti said before the cabinet approved his decision.
Kurti had promised during last year's election campaign to take a salary cut and push for greater wage equality if his leftist party Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) won. He reached a coalition agreement with a center-right party after lengthy talks and the new government took office on Feb. 3.
Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 but is still not recognized by Belgrade, remains one of the poorest countries in Europe and is dogged by corruption and nepotism.
Kosovo's statistics office said the average salary in the private sector was 401 euros in 2018, but 573 euros in the bloated public sector, where having political connections or enough money to bribe officials is required to land a job.
The International Monetary Fund has said the gap between private and public sector salaries is undermining Kosovo's financial health and competitiveness.
Kosovo, a country of 1.8 million people, expects economic growth of around 4 percent this year but economists say this would not be enough to tackle unemployment and poverty."

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Hafiz Saeed, accused by India and the United States of masterminding the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, was jailed for 11 years in Pakistan on Wednesday on terrorism financing charges, a government prosecutor and his defense lawyer said.
The Islamist leader was the first high profile figure convicted on terrorism financing charges in Pakistan, which denies regular accusations that it shelters militants.
The unprecedented ruling came ahead of a meeting of a world financial watchdog, Financial Action Task Force (FATF), next week to decide whether to blacklist Pakistan over a failure to curb terrorism financing.
Amid pressure from the FATF to take action against Saeed's militant groups, Pakistan charged him in December with collecting funds for his organizations, which are listed as terrorist organizations by the United Nations. He pleaded not guilty.
""Hafiz Saeed and another of his close aides have been sentenced in two cases of terrorism financing,"" prosecutor Abdul Rauf Watto told Reuters. 
""The total punishment in both the cases was 11 years but he will serve five and a half years in jail as the two punishments will run concurrently,"" Saeed's lawyer Imran Gill said. ""We will appeal against the verdict.""
Saeed is the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), or the Army of the Pure, a group blamed by India and the United States for the four-day Mumbai siege, in which 160 people, including Americans and other foreigners, were killed.
Saeed has denied any involvement and says his network, which spans 300 seminaries and schools, hospitals, a publishing house and ambulance services, has no ties to militant groups.
It is funded by charities Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF).
The JuD said Pakistan had been taking what it said were illegal and unconstitutional actions lately against Saeed and the groups, under pressure from West, and to please the FATF.
GRAY LIST
Saeed's groups publicly disavow armed militancy inside Pakistan, but say they offer vocal and moral support for rebel fighters in Indian-administered Kashmir in the disputed Himalayan region. The two nuclear-armed nations have fought two wars over Kashmir. 
Pakistan, included on a so-called gray list compiled by the FATF, has been under increasing pressure to curb the militants' financing. Blacklisting would likely result in tough financial and banking restrictions that could cripple Pakistan's already struggling economy.
The United States has offered a reward of $10 million for information leading to the conviction of Saeed, who has been arrested and released several times over the past decade.
Washington has long pressured Pakistan to try Saeed, who is designated a terrorist by the United States and the United Nations. 
Saeed and his group's charities had entered into the country's politics under a plan backed by Pakistan army in a bid to integrate the militants in mainstream society. They contested the 2018 general election under a new name, Milli Muslim League (MML), but did not secure any seats.
Western analysts say Saeed's groups are considered part of state-backed proxies nurtured and supported by Pakistan army to assert power in the region, a charge the military denies.

Najmuddin Faraj Ahmad, better known as Mullah Krekar, a former leader of the Ansar al-Islam militant group, won refugee status together with his family in Norway in the early 1990s.
In 2015, Italian authorities said that at least 15 suspected members of a militant group including Krekar had been arrested in six European countries on suspicion of planning attacks.
Krekar failed to avert extradition in the Norwegian courts, and the Justice Ministry on Wednesday gave its approval.
An appeal to the full cabinet is possible, but on past evidence is unlikely to succeed.
Krekar has been arrested several times during his years in Norway, once for threats against Prime Minister Erna Solberg.
Though deemed a threat to Norway's national security, Krekar was not deported back to Iraq because authorities there could not vouch for his safety.
At the time of his arrest in 2015, Krekar had already served an 18-month sentence for making death threats against a Kurdish man and giving an interview in which he encouraged other people to commit criminal acts.
Krekar's publicly appointed lawyer has said he will ask the European Court of Human Rights to intervene in the case."

SRINAGAR/NEW DELHI, India (Reuters) - More than two dozen diplomats are visiting Indian-administered Kashmir, New Delhi said on Wednesday, as the country tries to reassure foreign allies following several months of unrest in the contested territory.
The group includes European diplomats, some of whom declined a previous invitation from New Delhi to visit the region. A proposed vote in the European Union parliament next month could chastise India for its actions in Kashmir.
The Muslim-majority Himalayan region is claimed by India and arch-rival Pakistan and has been in turmoil since New Delhi stripped it of special status and clamped down on communication and freedom of movement in August.
India has since eased those restrictions, and restored limited internet connectivity last month, ending one of the world's longest such shutdowns in a democracy. 
But many political leaders, including three former chief ministers of Jammu & Kashmir state, are still in detention without charge six months after the crackdown, and foreign journalists have so far been denied permission to visit the region. 
Representatives from countries including Germany, Canada, France, New Zealand, Mexico, Italy, Afghanistan and Austria are on a two-day visit to ""witness for themselves the progressive normalization of the situation,"" India's foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. 
Representatives from several countries, including Germany's ambassador Walter Lindner, were pictured on a traditional wooden shikara boat on Dal Lake, in Kashmir's main city of Srinagar.
""We are interacting with the traders, businesswomen and entrepreneurs in Srinagar about the status of business and tourism,"" Afghanistan's envoy Tahir Qadiry said in a tweet on Wednesday. 
Sources familiar with the itinerary said the trip will also include meetings with the Indian army and government officials, as well as journalists and civil society groups selected by the security services. 
Last month fifteen foreign envoys visited Kashmir - a trip participants characterized as tightly-choreographed with no room for independent meetings.
""Things looked calm, but we only had a very short time out the window of the car to assess the situation,"" said a diplomat who attended the previous trip.

""They told the truth, but not necessarily the whole truth,"" he added of his meetings with delegates.

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 08:08AM ET</span>","Put me on trial, defiant Salvini says in Italian migrant boat case","By Angelo Amante
ROME (Reuters) - Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's right-wing League party, defiantly asked on Wednesday to be put on trial for detaining migrants at sea last year, even though the case could potentially sink his political career.
Senators were due to vote during the day on whether to lift Salvini's immunity after magistrates said they wanted to charge him for refusing to let a group of migrants dock last July as he waited for other European Union states to agree to take them in.
Salvini, an anti-immigrant populist who was serving as interior minister at the time, could eventually face up to 15 years in jail if found guilty at the end of Italy's tortuous legal process which normally takes years.
Conviction could also bar him from political office, dashing his ambitions to lead a future government.
With the vote in parliament almost certain to go against him, Salvini sought to make political capital out of the case, depicting himself as the defender of Italy's national interests.
""I have chosen against my own interests...to go to court and rely on the impartiality of the judiciary,"" said Salvini.
""Unlike others who run away, I do not flee and I will calmly await judgment, first of the courts and then of the Italian people when they get to vote,"" he told reporters. 
The byzantine nature of Italy's legal system means Salvini faces no immediate risk, but the case could prove a regular distraction as other investigations start to pile up at his door.
Earlier this month another tribunal in Sicily recommended that Salvini should stand trial over a separate migrant stand-off dating from last August, with parliament expected to decide on this case later in the year.
POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE
During his 14 months at the interior ministry, Salvini made tackling migrant boats a priority, barring ports to rescue ships and threatening the charities operating them with fines.
In July, two weeks before he abandoned a coalition with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, he refused to let migrants disembark from the Gregoretti coastguard vessel, ignoring pleas from human rights groups to let the group come ashore.
Magistrates in Sicily say this was an abuse of power and amounted to de facto kidnapping. But under Italian law, former ministers cannot be tried for actions undertaken while in office unless parliament authorizes the investigation.
Senior League politician Giulia Bongiorno, who is an experienced lawyer, has publicly urged Salvini to fight to maintain his immunity, warning a trial could backfire on him.
In the Senate (upper house) on Wednesday she said parliament should not accept the court request as this would undermine political independence. ""Senator Salvini, your destiny is at stake, but also the autonomy of political power,"" she said.
The Gregoretti investigation echoes another case from earlier last year when magistrates sought to try Salvini over his decision to keep 150 migrants aboard a coastguard ship for five days in August 2018.
On that occasion, parliament blocked the request, with 5-Star rallying to his support, arguing that the decision to keep the migrants at sea was a collective one. This time, his one-time allies say he acted unilaterally without prior assent.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, in one of the most significant decisions of his papacy, on Wednesday dismissed a proposal to allow some married men to be ordained in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) region to ease an acute scarcity of priests.
The recommendation, put forward by Latin American bishops last year, had alarmed conservatives in the deeply polarised 1.3 billion-member Roman Catholic Church, who feared it could lead to a change in the centuries-old commitment to celibacy among priests.
Francis delivered his response in an Apostolic Exhortation, three months after the proposal passed by 128 votes to 41 at a contentious Vatican assembly, or synod, of Roman Catholic bishops.
Apostolic Exhortations are used to instruct and encourage the Catholic faithful but do not define Church doctrine. 
Wednesday's 32-page document did not even mention the proposal, which was for older married deacons who are proven leaders of remote Catholic communities and have stable families to be ordained as priests. 
Conservatives balked, fearing that even a circumscribed change would be a slippery slope leading to a married priesthood throughout the Church. They branded a pre-synod working document as heretical.
In what some viewed as a strategically timed appeal to Francis not to approve the Amazon proposal, a book published last month by Church conservatives defended the tradition of priestly celibacy.
""From the Depths of Our Hearts"" was co-authored by Cardinal Robert Sarah and Former Pope Benedict, though Francis' predecessor subsequently disassociated himself from the project. 
Vatican officials said the pope completed the document on Dec. 27, before the book controversy, and handed it in for translations. They said no changes were made after that. 
In the Exhortation, the 82-year-old Argentine pope wrote, new ways must be found to encourage more priests to work in the remote region, and allow expanded roles for lay people and permanent deacons, of whom the Amazon needed ""many more"".
Deacons, like priests, are ordained ministers. They can preach, teach, baptise and run parishes, but they cannot say Mass. Married men can become deacons.
Because only priests can say Mass, people in at least 85% of Amazon villages cannot attend the liturgy every week and some cannot do so for years.
""This urgent need leads me to urge all bishops, especially those in Latin America... to be more generous in encouraging those who display a missionary vocation to opt for the Amazon region,"" he wrote.
He used the first three chapters of the document to defend the rights and legacies of indigenous people and the environment in the Amazon, which had to be protected because of its vital role in mitigating global warming.
Conservatives feared that if Francis had taken up the proposal, other areas with a shortage of priests would follow, even in developed countries such as Germany, where the issue is being discussed.

The 27 EU states were required to enact by January tighter rules to counter dirty-money risks in a wide range of sectors, including cryptocurrency exchanges, prepaid cards and shell companies.
The rules were proposed in 2016 by the EU Commission in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks which killed more than 130 people. The clampdown was meant to hamper terrorist funding and other financial crimes.
EU governments and lawmakers agreed on the new rules three years ago and then formally adopted them in 2018, but Cyprus, Hungary, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain have not yet turned them into national laws, the EU Commission said on Wednesday.
It sent them a letter of ""formal notice"", the first step of a lengthy legal procedure that could lead to fines if rules are not correctly applied.
The warnings show heightened attention by EU authorities for the fight against money laundering after a series of high-profile cases that hit major banks in the bloc in past years.
However, the commissioner responsible for money laundering, Valdis Dombrovskis, a former prime minister of Latvia, has been criticized by lawmakers for slowing down new reforms invoked after dirty-money scandals in Latvia, Denmark, Estonia, Malta, Cyprus and other EU states.
Under the latest overhaul, cryptocurrency exchange platforms are required to identify their users, ending anonymity that could favor money laundering. It will also be easier to identify the ultimate owners of companies and trusts."

LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook (O:FB) on Wednesday said it had suspended a network of accounts used by Russian military intelligence to seed false narratives online targeting Ukraine and other countries in Eastern Europe.
""Although the people behind this network attempted to conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation found links to Russian military intelligence services,"" Facebook said in a statement.
Facebook, which has struggled to stop governments and political groups using its platform to spread false or misleading information, regularly announces it has shut down disinformation campaigns from countries including Russia.
The Russian Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Moscow has previously denied Western allegations of political meddling, including findings by U.S. Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller that it used social media accounts in an attempt to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential vote.
Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said the latest Russian operation used more than 100 accounts on Facebook and its Instagram photo-sharing platform to create fake personas, often posing as journalists in the targeted countries.
These accounts then contacted local media and politicians to plant false stories about politically divisive issues, such as corruption allegations, ethnic tensions in the Russian-annexed peninsula of Crimea and the downing of a Malaysian airliner in Ukraine in 2014.
""We've known for a long time that these people look for authentic voices to amplify their narratives,"" Gleicher told Reuters. ""It is more of a classic intelligence operation, trying to manipulate key individuals to achieve a high impact.""
Researchers at social media analytics firm Graphika, who reviewed the accounts before they were suspended by Facebook, said most of the activity dated back to 2016 and 2017, although some accounts were active as recently as this year.
The network failed to gather more than a few thousand followers but was able to get articles published in some local media outlets, said Ben Nimmo, Graphika's head of investigations.
The fake journalist personas also conducted interviews with Kremlin critics, tricking them into making unguarded comments and then sharing the messages online, he said.
""The operation tried to poison the well of information by using false personas to plant pro-Kremlin and anti-Western narratives online and in local news outlets,"" said Nimmo.
Facebook said it had also suspended two other groups of accounts, unconnected to the Russian operation. One was linked to a previously-identified Iranian network that has targeted the United States and the other to a PR firm in Vietnam."

Despite his defense and foreign ministers last week speaking favorably of the VFA, Duterte's decision was not a complete surprise given his disdain for the Philippines' close ties with Washington and what he sees as subservience to an abusive and hypocritical former colonial ruler.
He has been determined to build a strong relationship with China, despite a history of diplomatic friction, and some unease among a U.S.-leaning defense apparatus wary about Beijing's militarization and island-building in the South China Sea.
Duterte's spokesman Salvador Panelo said U.S. disagreement with the firebrand president's move was motivated by its own strategic interests, and that it was time for the Philippines to be militarily independent.
""Reliance on another country for our own defenses against the enemies of the state will ultimately weaken and stagnate our defense mechanisms,"" Panelo said in a statement. ""We must stand on our own and put a stop to being a parasite to another country in protecting our independence and sovereignty.""
But the move defies domestic opinion, with polls consistently showing Filipinos' mistrust of China and strong approval of the United States, where millions of their relatives live, including those of some of Duterte's cabinet ministers.
The VFA is the legal framework for the thousands of rotating U.S. troops involved in as many as 300 joint exercises a year in the Philippines. Some lawmakers hope it can be saved in the 180 days before the termination takes effect, and worry that without it, two other U.S. military agreements will be irrelevant.
U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Tuesday said the decision was a move in the wrong direction at a time when Washington and its Asian allies were trying to press China to abide by ""international rules of order"".
Duterte's spokesman Panelo rejected that, calling it ""a move in the right direction that should have been done a long time ago"".
Duterte's opponents are dismayed and see the move as his personal favor to China, among them former foreign secretary Albert del Rosario, who called his decision ""incomprehensible and harmful"".
""What is unfolding before us must be considered a national tragedy which should be resisted,"" he said."
1134,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 06:01AM ET</span>","Vietnam needs stimulus package to alleviate coronavirus impact, ministry says","HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam must work out a stimulus package this month to help businesses cope with a coronavirus epidemic that is expected to keep the economy from achieving a target of 6.8% growth this year, the planning ministry said on Wednesday.
The virus outbreak has killed more than 1,100 people in China, Vietnam's largest trading partner, and the southeast Asian nation confirmed another case on Tuesday, taking its total to 15.
""The epidemic has caused widespread impacts, disrupting global supply chains,"" the planning and investment ministry said in a statement submitted to the government.
""Vietnam has an open economy and shares a long border with China, so the impact (on Vietnam) will be significant.""
Vietnam's central bank should offer credit support for small- and medium-sized enterprises and farmers hit by the virus, it said, such as interest rate cuts and deferred loan repayment.
The finance ministry should consider cutting taxes and delay tax payment and land rent payment for certain affected businesses, it added.
It urged that the measures be submitted to the government for approval in February.
Vietnam's hardest hit industries include tourism, transport, electronics, agriculture and insurance, the ministry said.
Vietnam's growth in gross domestic product this year would be 6.25% if the epidemic was contained within the first quarter, and 5.96% if it was contained in the second quarter, it added.
Inflation would be 4.86% this year if the epidemic was contained within the second quarter, it said, which would frustrate a target of keeping inflation below 4%.
The epidemic has cost Vietnamese airlines about 10 trillion dong ($430 million) in lost revenues following travel curbs between Vietnam and China, the government has said.
It could also wipe $5.9 billion to $7.7 billion from Vietnam's tourism earnings in the next three months as international travellers stay away."
1135,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 05:58AM ET</span>",Berlin to limit sensitive military tenders to German firms,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Angela Merkel's government said on Wednesday it would restrict tenders for the procurement of sensitive weapon systems to German companies, a protectionist measure by a chancellor who has come out strongly against such barriers.
In a strategy paper that takes effect immediately, the government said it would extend the remit of existing rules to include naval vessels and electronic warfare technologies.
Until now, the government had only limited tenders for submarines to German defense companies. The expanded strategy is partly designed to make the local defense sector more competitive.
The draft stipulates that, if German defense contractors fail to meet the requirements of the German armed forces, tenders will be opened to rivals from the European Union.
""We want to sustain and support the development of core defense capabilities that are of strategic relevance in German as well as in the EU,"" said Economy Minister Peter Altmaier.
On Tuesday, lawmakers from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling conservatives backed a proposal to restrict foreign vendors of 5G mobile network technology, sources said, to address the concerns of critics who see the market leader, China's Huawei, as a threat to national security.
Under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, Germany plans to reach a defense spending allocation agreed by the NATO military alliance belatedly in 2031, missing a 2024 target.
NATO leaders agreed in 2014, after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, to spend the equivalent of 2% of their economic output on defense by 2024.
Only seven NATO countries currently meet or exceed that target - the United States, Britain, Greece, Poland and the three Baltic states - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.
The German army is set to issue a tender for two tank ships, which under the new rules would be built by German shipyards.

1136,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>","No coalition without Merkel, say German Social Democrats","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) signaled on Wednesday they could quit their coalition with Angela Merkel's conservatives if she is forced out as chancellor, piling pressure on their partners to avoid a snap election as they pick a new leader.
After Merkel's protegee Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer gave up her ambitions for the top job on Monday, the Christian Democrats (CDU) are embarking on choosing a new leader and chancellor candidate for the next federal election due by Oct. 2021.
The possibility of having a rival as party leader while she remains chancellor may be unworkable and force Merkel, who will not seek re-election after leading Europe's biggest economy for around 15 years, to stand down early.
This could trigger an early election, not least because the SPD have made clear their coalition deal is only with Merkel. 
SPD General-Secretary Lars Klingbeil said the party entered the coalition with Merkel. ""And we will leave the coalition with her - as planned at the next regular federal election,"" he said in some of the clearest comments yet from a senior SPD figure.
""I am aware of no other election date,"" he added.
The fragile coalition has already come close to collapse several times and the selection last year of two leftists as possible new SPD leaders has left the alliance even more shaky.
Many lawmakers want to avoid the upheaval of an election during Germany's tenure of the rotating presidency of the EU in the second half of this year. 
Klingbeil said he expected the conservatives were aware of their responsibilities and was ""not running away from the EU presidency"".
The SPD may find it impossible to work with at least two of the potential conservative candidates, Friedrich Merz and Jens Spahn, who are further to the right of the CDU than Merkel, although others may be more palatable. 
While the SPD wants to stay in government with the conservatives for the full legislative term, it is ready to fight an election at any time, said Klingbeil.
Kramp-Karrenbauer threw the CDU, and Merkel's plan for a smooth transition of power, into turmoil on Monday with her announcement which followed months of mounting doubts about her suitability for the top job. 
The last straw came last week when a local CDU branch defied her and voted with the far-right to install a local leader.

NAKHON RATCHASIMA, Thailand (Reuters) - A Thai soldier's killing of 29 people in a rage over a housing deal involving his superior officer has brought attention to the business dealings of army personnel in a country that just emerged from direct military rule.
Thailand's army chief has promised to investigate and also acknowledged a wider problem of inappropriate business deals involving army officers and their subordinates, vowing to root out the practise.
The military, which staged its latest coups 2006 and 2014, wields extraordinary power in Thailand and proclaims its discipline to justify repeatedly overthrowing elected governments, but the killings on the weekend put a spotlight on some of its own members' questionable dealings.
Sergeant Major Jakrapanth Thomma was meeting on Saturday with his commanding officer and the officer's mother-in-law to discuss their dispute when he opened fire, killing both of them. He then drove to his army camp, a Buddhist temple and a shopping mall, gunning people down until security forces killed him on Sunday morning.
Hours before, Jakrapanth had posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) denouncing people who cheated others to become wealthy.
""Do they think they can spend the money in hell?"" Jakrapanth asked.
The military has a long tradition of involvement in business and it has been an open secret that some officers branch out into private business deals.
""It is actually quite common for senior military officers to be involved in real estate, especially in Thailand's rural areas,"" said Paul Chambers, a politics expert at Naresuan University in northern Thailand.
The military is one of the largest land-holders in some provinces, controlling vast bases that also can be mini-cities unto themselves.
""Many officers tend to want to supplement their meager salaries with money they can easily make through military power regarding real estate,"" Chambers said.
Military discipline is regularly extolled by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who launched the last coup in 2014 and last year retained power by leading a pro-army party to victory in an election opposition parties said was engineered to cement army influence.
One prominent opposition group, the Future Forward Party, has openly opposed military influence over politics, arguing for changes in the military-written constitution, an end to conscription and cutting the army budget.
'INJUSTICE'
Army chief General Apirat Kongsompong has said he will set up a direct line for soldiers who feel they are being exploited by superior officers.
""The cause and reason for the perpetrator in this incident were the injustice he received from his commanding officer and relatives,"" Apirat said in a press briefing on Tuesday.
He also acknowledged wider reports of officers exploiting a system of military housing loans and welfare schemes for personal gain.
""There are cooperation between units and private contractor that lobby for deals,"" Apirat said
""I know about this and I want to assure that in the next three months some generals and colonels will lose their jobs,"" he said.
Details of the deal that enraged Jakrapanth are not clear, but it appears to have involved his purchase of a house, brokered by the mother-in-law of his commanding officer, Colonel Anantharot Krasae.
Police told Reuters that Jakrapanth argued he was owed 50,000 baht ($1,600) by the mother-in-law, whose husband said she had already given the money to an agent who failed to pass it on to the soldier. Members of the family did not respond to messages from Reuters.
However, lawyer Atchariya Ruangrattanapong, said the dispute may have been over a larger amount – 375,000 baht ($12,000) - and said he has been approached since the shooting by 20 other members of Jakrapanth's unit complaining about the same scheme.
""Apart from this group, I have been informed that there are hundreds of other soldiers who are scammed in a similar situation,"" said Atchariya.
'CLOSED KINGDOM'
Defense Ministry spokesman Kongcheep Tantrawanit acknowledged reports of officers profiting from sweetheart deals but said the issue was endemic in society.
""All this is an ongoing problem that not just the army but also the government faces,"" Kongcheep said.
But the military has a lack of transparency beyond other institutions that makes it easier to exploit the system, said Anusorn Unno, a lecturer at Thammasat University.
""The army is like a closed kingdom,"" Anusorn said.
""Those with higher ranks have the advantage in doing business within this closed system.""
The Bangkok Post said in an editorial that questionable personal deals were ""the tip of the iceberg"" and argued the military budget should be subject to independent audits, instead of the internal ones established by the last ruling junta.
""Without allowing greater external audits, the army risks harboring more and more shady operations."""
1139,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 05:27AM ET</span>","Widowed, imprisoned, detained: remnants of Islamic State in limbo in Syria","By Goran Tomasevic and Issam Abdallah
QAMISHLI, Syria (Reuters) - In northeastern Syria, prisons and detention camps hold thousands of men, women and children whose lives are in limbo nearly a year after the final defeat of Islamic State to which they once belonged.
The area around Qamishli city is mainly controlled by Kurdish fighters who helped defeat the Islamist militant group. They have since been pushed into a small pocket of northeastern Syria by Turkish-led forces who consider them a security threat.
Kurdish forces bear the brunt of looking after those captured as Islamic State collapsed, including hundreds of foreigners who fought alongside local militants to create a self-declared caliphate in the Middle East.
What to do with the remnants of Islamic State, whose fighters tortured and executed thousands of people during its zenith from 2014, is a thorny issue for countries whose citizens went to fight with the group.
Many European countries, for example, have hesitated to repatriate nationals, fearing a public backlash if they do. Europeans comprise a fifth of the roughly 10,000 Islamic State fighters held captive in Syria by Kurdish militias.
Kurdish officials say they lack the resources to properly detain, investigate and prosecute the large number of prisoners as well as their families in camps. They have called repeatedly on foreign nations to take back their citizens.
""We want to know what our fate is,"" said Mahmoud Mohammad, an IS fighter from Syria held by Kurdish forces in a prison near the town of Hasaka, south of Qamishli.
""We don't know anything about our families,"" he told Reuters in an interview arranged and supervised by Kurdish security forces during a sanctioned visit to the jail.
""We don't know if they're alive or dead, in Syria or outside. I want to know my sentence and my fate.""
Mohammad, whose nom de guerre is Abu Hamza, was one of nine men interviewed by Reuters in two prisons - one located near Hasaka and the other the town's central jail.
Most were from Syria or Iraq, one was from the United States and another from Belgium.
Some were fighters, others said they were corralled into working for Islamic State as the movement won territory across Syria and Iraq.
""I worked with (Islamic State) as a civilian,"" said Abdurrahman Mustafa al-Jomaa, a 32-year-old Syrian from Raqqa, who was being held at the central Hasaka jail.
""My sentence is 2 years. I'm married and have two children. My family is in Raqqa and they come and visit me.""
CROWDED PRISON, SPRAWLING CAMP
Conditions in the prison near Hasaka, which used to be a school before being transformed to cope with the influx of captives, were markedly worse than those at the central jail.
Reuters reporters saw more than 50 men lying head-to-toe across the floor of one cell, leaving virtually no room to move. Natural light was minimal and the air was heavy with the smell of sweat and dirt.
In a hospital on the ground floor, about 100 men crowded on to around half the number of beds suffering from ailments and injuries. Several were in orange jumpsuits, similar to those often worn by IS captives before they were executed.
Beyond the prisons, thousands of mostly woman and children are detained in camps in the area.
The al-Hol facility in Hasaka province is the biggest and holds tens of thousands of people in a sprawling camp of white canvas tents that provide minimal shelter from the winter cold and rain.
Children play on muddy paths and large puddles full of refuse collect in open spaces. Women wearing black robes and niqabs move around in small groups, chatting or carrying out daily chores.
Most women approached by Reuters for an interview declined and some were verbally hostile.
One who agreed to talk did not give her name, but spoke in broken English and said she was originally from Hong Kong before coming to the Middle East to join Islamic State.
""I have one child and my husband died in Baghouz,"" she said, flanked by her toddler son. The town of Baghouz, Islamic State's last enclave in eastern Syria, fell to U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in spring last year.
The woman said she was in touch with her family in Hong Kong but did not want to return.
""I know here the situation is very difficult. This is not home, it's just a tent ... but we all live to (the wishes of) Allah, so God-willing, all is good.""

KIEV (Reuters) - The Ukrainian president's new chief of staff on Wednesday stuck to Kiev's existing positions on ending the war against Russian-backed forces in the eastern Donbass region but said there could be compromises during negotiations with Moscow. 
Andriy Yermak was speaking a day after his appointment by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, which coincided with Russia installing a new point person on Ukraine who is seen as less hawkish than his predecessor. 
Yermak's appointment sparked criticism from opposition lawmakers in Ukraine, who said he might be too soft on Russia, prompting Zelenskiy to issue a statement denying there would be any political shift with Yermak in charge.
Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed after Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, and over its backing for fighters in the Donbass region in a war that has killed more than 13,000 people and brought Western sanctions on Russia.
There are still regular casualties despite a ceasefire struck in Minsk in 2015. 
Yermak rehearsed Zelenskiy's existing positions: that ending the war was Ukraine's priority, but that there could be no elections in the Donbass if it was still under illegal occupation and Kiev did not control its own borders.
He signalled there could be some wiggle room in talks with Russia but did not spell out what that might be. 
""There can certainly be compromises during the negotiations,"" Yermak said. ""But we have talked about this many times, and I also want to add that I am ready and will continue to do this: speak with all patriotic, competent, reasonable forces in this country.""
The leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany held a peace summit in Paris in December in the so-called Normandy format. Yermak said Ukraine was willing to carry out the agreements made there. 
There have been some signs of a thaw in relations, including prisoner swaps last year that Yermak worked to bring about in his previous role as a presidential aide. 
Asked about Russia's new point person on Ukraine, Dmitry Kozak, Yermak said:
""I have not spoken to Mr Kozak since his appointment and my appointment.""

""But regardless of who represents the Russian Federation in the negotiations in Minsk or in the Normandy format, the principles declared by President Zelenskiy are unchanged.""

The LNA has been trying since last April to capture the capital Tripoli from the internationally recognized government but has failed to breach the city's defenses.
U.N. envoy Ghassan Salame has been mediating between Haftar, who is backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, and the Tripoli government supported by Turkey.

Erdogan said Turkey is determined to push Syrian government forces beyond Turkish observation posts in the northwestern Idlib region by the end of February, and he warned allied Syrian rebels not to give government forces an excuse to attack.
Violence has flared in Idlib, just south of Turkey's border, in recent weeks as government forces backed by Russia and Iran have made gains in their campaign to eliminate the last insurgent bastion after the country's nine year war. 
Turkey, which is allied with some rebel groups opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, mounted a counter attack on Tuesday after 13 Turkish military personnel were killed by Syrian shelling in Idlib in the last 10 days. 
""If there is the smallest injury to our soldiers on the observation posts or other places, I am declaring from here that we will hit the regime forces everywhere from today, regardless of Idlib's borders or the lines of the Sochi agreement,"" Erdogan said, referring to a 2018 ceasefire accord. 
""We will do this by any means necessary, by air or ground, without hesitating, without allowing for any stalling,"" he told members of his AK Party in Ankara. Russia, which has an air base in Syria, has controlled Idlib's air space for several years.
The Turkish military casualties have strained ties between Ankara and Moscow. The TASS news agency quoted the Kremlin as saying Russian President Vladimir Putin and Erdogan agreed in a phone call that the sides would continue contacts on Syria.
Erdogan said Turkey-backed rebels have mobilized to push Syrian government forces out of Idlib, but added they must remain disciplined.

Some of the officers also face accusations they misappropriated fuel and used it for their own private vehicles.

The United States is Taiwan's most important international backer, even in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, and is also the island's main source of arms.
Tensions spiked between Taiwan and China, which claims the island as its own, on Sunday and Monday, as Taiwan sent F-16s to shadow approaching Chinese bombers and fighters.
China has been flying what it calls ""island encirclement"" drills on-off since 2016 when Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen first took office. Beijing believes Tsai, who won re-election last month, wishes to push the island's formal independence.
Tsai says Taiwan is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said one U.S. MC-130, a special mission aircraft based on the C-130 Hercules transport, flew down the Taiwan Strait in a southerly direction.
The two B-52 bombers skirted Taiwan's east coast, also in a southerly direction, the ministry added.
Taiwan's armed forces monitored both sets of flights, and nothing out of the ordinary was observed, it said, without giving more details.
The U.S. Air Force has a major base on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa, which lies close to Taiwan.
China has described its exercises on Sunday and Monday as actions to guard national sovereignty.
Taiwan has urged China to focus its efforts on fighting the new coronavirus rather than menacing the island.
Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said in a statement earlier on Wednesday that China's military activities had only caused anger on the island and harmed the peaceful development of relations across the strait.

The UAE is a leading partner in a Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to restore ousted President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government after it was toppled by the Houthis in late 2014. In July the UAE said it was withdrawing its troops from Yemen, but remained a part of the coalition.

In 2007, Australia introduced seven targets designed to address inequalities that see the country's 700,000 Indigenous people track near the bottom of its 25 million citizens in almost every economic and social indicator.
But Morrison said Australia's government is policy is failing and will be replaced.
""We perpetuated an ingrained way of thinking passed down over two centuries and more, and it was the belief that we knew better than our Indigenous peoples. We don't,"" Morrison told Australia's Parliament.
""We also thought we understood their problems better than they did. We don't. They live them. We must see the gap we wish to close, not from our viewpoints, but from the viewpoint of Indigenous Australians.""
Morrison said new Indigenous polices will be designed following consultation with its first people, with whom Australia has struggled to reconcile following hundreds of years of brutal segregation.
Indigenous Australians arrived on the continent at least 50,000 years before British colonists but are not recognized in the national constitution.
According to the annual report, literacy rates for Indigenous students are 20% are behind the national benchmark, child mortality is more than double that for non-Indigenous children, while unemployment in the Indigenous population is more than 25% higher than the rest of the country.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 01:37AM ET</span>",Taiwan says it didn't need China's permission for WHO meeting,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's presence at a World Health Organization (WHO) meeting this week on the new coronavirus was the result of direct talks between the island and the body, and did not require China's permission, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday.
The island's lack of WHO membership, due to the objections of China, which considers it a wayward Chinese province and not a separate state, has been an increasingly sore point for Taiwan amid the virus outbreak.
Taiwan has complained it has been unable to get timely information from the WHO and has accused China of passing incorrect information to the organization about Taiwan's total virus case numbers, which stand at 18. China has more than 44,000.
But in a small diplomatic breakthrough for the island, its health experts were this week allowed to attend an online technical meeting on the virus.
China's Foreign Ministry said that was because China gave approval for Taiwan's participation. Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said China was trying to take credit for something it didn't deserve.
""The participation of our experts at this WHO forum was an arrangement made by our government and the WHO directly. It did not need China's approval,"" Ou added.
Taiwan's experts took part in a personal capacity to avoid political disputes, and did not give their nationality when joining the online forum, she said.
The WHO did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Taiwan's WHO exclusion became another point of contention between China and the United States last week, after the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva told the WHO's Executive Board that the agency should deal directly with Taiwan's government.
China, which says Beijing adequately represents Taiwan at the WHO, accused the United States of a political ""hype-up"" about the issue.
China and the WHO say they have ensured Taiwan is kept up to date with virus developments and that communication with the island is smooth.
Taiwan's democratically elected government says that it alone has the right to represent the island's 23 million people, that it has never been a part of the People's Republic of China, and that it has no need to be represented by them.

1152,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 12:31AM ET</span>",Australia's 'black summer' provides glimmer of hope for climate policy action,"By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's deadly wildfires have opened up a small window of opportunity for the country to break a decade-long impasse on climate policy, as some politicians and big business push for major change.
Independent politician Zali Steggall this week unveiled proposed legislation to target zero carbon emissions by 2050, aiming to take advantage of a subtle shift in rhetoric from the conservative Liberal-led coalition government.
""Eighty percent of the public wants to see us addressing climate change. The impacts are real. We are experiencing them now,"" Steggall, who plans to introduce the bill into parliament next month, told Reuters.
Steggall and other crossbench politicians are pushing for all lawmakers to be allowed a conscience vote on the bill. That would enable members of the Liberal Party and main opposition Labor Party who oppose building new coal-fired plants and have constituents pressing for more climate action to unite to pass the legislation.
But it will be an uphill battle as Prime Minister Scott Morrison faces fresh calls by some in his conservative government to fund new coal-fired power stations, a policy popular with some voters because it stabilizes jobs, boosts power supplies and keeps a lid on energy prices.
Without substantial support from Labor and moderates in the Liberal-led coalition government, the bill is unlikely to pass.
The issue of climate change has plagued leaders of Australia for the past decade, contributing to the downfall of at least three prime ministers. As the world's biggest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas and one of the world's biggest carbon emitters per person, Australia has also come under fire from global climate activists and the United Nations for not taking more responsibility to curb global warming.
Morrison acknowledged last week climate change was a factor in what he has dubbed Australia's ""Black Summer"", in which bushfires have killed 33 people, charred nearly 12 million hectares (29.7 million acres) of land and wreaked billions of dollars in damage.
That was a slight shift from remarks made as recently as January, when he largely blamed a lack of preemptive burn-off to clear hazardous vegetation and a three-year drought for the devastating bushfires.
""What it shows is there's a recognition that climate change is problematic for Australia and we need to take more action to protect ourselves against the consequences,"" said Mark Howden, director of the Climate Change Institute at Australian National University.
BUSINESS SUPPORT
The Business Council of Australia (BCA) is backing Steggall's proposed legislation, which includes a call for five-year plans to meet specific emissions budgets, to create certainty for investors.
""If we could get the two political parties to agree to that and legislate it, we would have made a massive advance in this country, because we would know where we're going,"" BCA Chief Executive Jennifer Westacott said on Australian television on Monday.
The quandary for politicians is that Australia's big manufacturers are heavy power consumers, in turn dependent on the country's abundant, but heavily polluting, coal and gas supply.
Protecting those sectors and keeping energy prices down has led to a decade of flip-flops on climate policies. That has left the country on track to miss its emissions reduction target under the Paris Climate Accord, according to the government's own projections.
Labor, which failed to oust the coalition government in an election last May after alienating voters in coal mining-heavy districts, urged Morrison to allow debate on Steggall's bill but stopped short of endorsing it.""Labor welcomes any constructive effort to progress climate action and looks forward to continuing to engage with Zali Steggall about her Climate Change Bill,"" the shadow minister for climate change and energy Mark Butler said in a statement.
MISSING TARGETS
Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor did not directly answer questions from Reuters about whether the government would support the bill, but said he expects to deliver a long term emissions reduction strategy before the next U.N. climate summit in Glasgow in November.
""The pathway to meaningful impacts on global emissions is through development and deployment of new technologies. The answer is not a new tax or more bureaucracy,"" Taylor said in emailed comments.
For Australia to meet its Paris accord target of cutting carbon emissions by at least 26% from 2005 levels by 2030, it needs to cut annual emissions to 462 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2-e).
Despite Morrison repeatedly boasting that Australia will meet that ""in a canter"", the government forecast in December that Australia's emissions would fall to 511 Mt in 2030, only 16% below 2005 levels.
Making the challenge even harder, emissions are growing from Australia's largest industrial facilities, offsetting reductions in the power sector since 2005, research firm RepuTex said.
""The tension gets higher and the need to act gets more pressing, but the fundamentals that have slowed governments to date haven't gone away,"" said Matthew Warren, a former energy industry leader working as a consultant with the BCA. ""That's what we're trying to wrestle with."""
1153,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 12:26AM ET</span>","Japan cruise ship coronavirus cases climb to 175, including quarantine officer","By David Dolan and Ju-min Park
TOKYO (Reuters) - Another 39 people have tested positive for the coronavirus on the cruise ship Diamond Princess quarantined in Japan, with one quarantine officer also infected, bringing the total to 175, the health ministry said on Wednesday. 
The Diamond Princess was placed in quarantine for two weeks upon arriving in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, on Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus.
The epidemic originated in mainland China, where more than 1,100 people have now died from the virus.
About 3,700 people are on board the ship, which usually has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670. 
The ministry said tests were being conducted for others deemed to need them and it would announce the results later.
The British-flagged Diamond Princess is managed by Princess Cruise Lines, one of the world's largest cruise lines and a unit of Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp.
Kyodo news agency, citing the health ministry, said that of the 39 cases, 10 were crew and 29 were passengers.
Ten were Japanese nationals and the others were from 11 countries including the United States and China. Four were in serious condition, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said.
People testing positive for the virus are taken off the ship to hospital.
The quarantine officer who was infected had been handing out questionnaires checking the health of passengers and crew since Feb. 3, and had been following rules that require the wearing of a mask and gloves but not a full protective suit, according to the Nikkei business daily, quoting the health ministry.
""It's terrible about the quarantine officer,"" one passenger on the ship, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.
""The ones who came to our room to do the initial screening had gloves and surgical masks, while the ones who came to do the actual virus test also had full gowns and full face masks.""
'HIGH RISK'
A health ministry official had no immediate comment, but Nikkei said the ministry was checking the officer's contacts with colleagues and family members.
""There are lots of ways to get infected even if you're wearing a mask. Hand hygiene, touching the mask and then not washing hands, wearing a mask but touching your eyes with contaminated hands ... It happens,"" said David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto.
""Personal protective items reduce risk, they don't eliminate it,"" he said.
Mark Kortepeter, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said while it was hard to reach conclusions based on limited information, the ship infections pointed to an ""agent that is highly transmissible"" at least in enclosed environments.
""The infected quarantine officer probably indicates the high risk, even for individuals who are trying to protect themselves, because the virus is unforgiving and there is no room for error in use of personal protective equipment and hand hygiene,"" he said.
""A small number of virus particles is likely needed to infect, making it an efficient spreader.""
The government was considering allowing elderly and those with chronic illnesses to disembark before the Feb. 19 target date for the end of quarantine, some media reported, but added it would take time to determine where they could be sent.
About 80% of the passengers were aged 60 or over, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in the 90s, the English-language Japan Times newspaper reported.
The foreign ministry released a notice on Wednesday urging its nationals to consider delaying trips to China and for Japanese in China to return home.
Japan has sent four chartered flights to China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, for its citizens there to return and plans a fifth.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 10:55PM ET</span>",Mexico City killing sparks fury over violence against women,"By Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The gruesome murder of a 25-year-old woman in Mexico's capital has unleashed outrage among authorities and rights groups after leaked photos of her mutilated body appeared on the front page of a newspaper.
Prosecutors will seek the maximum punishment for Ingrid Escamilla's murder, the capital's mayor said on Tuesday, adding a suspect had been arrested for the crime that took place at an apartment north of the city center at the weekend.
Marches to protest violence against women have intensified in recent months, with demonstrators setting government buildings on fire and daubing monuments with graffiti.
An average of 10 women were killed a day in Mexico in 2018, the year with the highest number of murders of women in three decades, according to official data. For women who suffered violence, more than 40% of them were victims of their partners.
Escamilla's murder was a particularly horrific display of brutality in a country accustomed to regular violence.
Police found the young woman's body skinned and without organs.
A man identified by media as the detained suspect, appeared in a video, streaked with blood, talking to police. Media said the man was the woman's domestic partner. A police spokeswoman referred questions about the case to the prosecutor's office.
A photograph of the victim featured on the cover of Pasala, a newspaper that splashes gory stories and photographs on its front pages, often with salacious headlines.
The headline accompanying Escamilla's photograph read: ""It was cupid's fault."" Editors at Pasala did not respond to a request for comment.
The Mexico City prosecutor's office said on Tuesday it was investigating six civil servants to determine who leaked the images.
Some social media users reacted to the gory photograph by posting pictures of Escamilla showing her smiling and confident, with neatly combed hair and bright lipstick.
""Out of respect to you and your family, this is the only way I want to remember you,"" one user wrote on Twitter, where #IngridEscamilla and #JusticeForIngrid were trending topics.
The National Women's Institute of Mexico (Inmujeres) condemned the publication of the photograph and the crime.
""Mexico is facing a tremendous challenge with respect to violence against women,"" the institute said in a statement. ""We urge the media to work with rigor and professionalism.""
Milenio Television reported that Escamilla had filed a complaint against her partner several months ago but later withdrew it."
1155,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 09:01PM ET</span>",Senator Bennet drops out of 2020 Democratic presidential race,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a moderate who has stressed improving education for Americans, abandoned his bid on Tuesday for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
Bennet, 55, told supporters shortly after polls closed in New Hampshire that it was ""fitting"" to end his presidential effort in the state, where he had campaigned energetically.
Bennet encouraged voters to remain engaged and improve turnout in the November election when Democrats will seek to unseat Republican President Donald Trump.
""I want you to be optimistic tonight, you have to be optimistic tonight – this is in our hands,"" Bennet said.
The 2020 race was an uphill climb for Bennet, who was largely unknown to the American public and failed to break out of a crowded field. Bennet qualified for the party's debates in June and July but failed to meet tougher standards for the six debates since then.
Bennet had focused his campaign on New Hampshire, holding 50 town-hall events between early December and Tuesday's primary election, but his efforts failed to gain traction. 
He began his long-shot Democratic primary campaign a month after announcing that he had prostate cancer. He underwent surgery during a legislative break and jumped into the Democratic race in May.
As a presidential candidate, Bennet had his roots in the party's establishment at a time when progressives and political newcomers were grabbing the political spotlight.
He grew up in Washington, the son of a former State Department official, and his grandfather advised President Franklin Roosevelt. A graduate of Wesleyan University and Yale Law School, he served in the Clinton Justice Department before moving west.
Bennet was appointed to the Senate in 2009 after his predecessor, Ken Salazar, was named secretary of the interior by President Barack Obama. He won re-election in 2016.

1156,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 08:37PM ET</span>",Trump to nominate envoy for North Korea to United Nations job,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump plans to nominate the State Department's deputy special representative for North Korea to a post at the United Nations, the White House said on Tuesday.
Alex Wong has been nominated to be the alternate U.S. representative for special political affairs at the world body with the rank of ambassador, a White House statement said.
The move follows a report suggesting that Trump, who held a series of unprecedented but largely fruitless summits with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un aimed at persuading Kim to give up his nuclear weapons, could be losing interest in the efforts.
CNN on Monday quoted two sources familiar with the matter as saying that Trump, frustrated at the lack of progress, had told top foreign policy advisers he does not want another summit with Kim before the U.S. presidential election in November.
Talks between the two sides have stalled since last year over an inability to reconcile North Korea's demands for relief from punishing sanctions and other concessions and U.S. demands for North Korea to denuclearize.
The senior U.S. envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, took over the job of deputy secretary of state in December.
While North Korea has not tested a nuclear bomb or long-range missile since 2017, a confidential U.N. report seen by Reuters on Monday said it continued to enhance its nuclear and ballistic missile programs last year in breach of U.N. sanctions.
North Korea did not act on a threat to present the United States with a ""Christmas surprise"" that some feared could involve a return to testing, but Kim has warned that the world would soon see a ""new strategic weapon.""
On Tuesday, Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think tank said satellite imagery of North Korea's main nuclear site at Yongbyon taken on Feb. 10 showed three specialized railcars that have been associated with the movement of radioactive material in the past.
It said it was unclear what type of material was being transported, but the relatively small size and number of casks on the railcars suggested outbound shipment of small quantities of irradiated liquid or solid waste, contaminated equipment, or movement of fissile material to facilities outside Yongbyon. The report suggested the activity could also be a carefully calibrated move by North Korea to maneuver current international diplomatic tensions."

WASHINGTON/KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said on Tuesday he was told by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that ""notable progress"" had been made in talks between the United States and the Taliban on an agreement for a U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.
In a post on Twitter, Ghani wrote that Pompeo had informed him in a telephone call that the Taliban had made a proposal ""with regards to bringing a significant and enduring reduction in violence.""
Ghani's tweet indicated a possible breakthrough in U.S.-Taliban talks in Qatar, which have been deadlocked in part over a U.S. demand that the insurgents agree to significantly reduce violence as part of any American troop withdrawal accord.
U.S. President Donald Trump has made a withdrawal of the 13,000 U.S. service members from Afghanistan a major foreign policy objective. An agreement with the Taliban could boost Trump's re-election prospects this November.
""U.S. talks with the Taliban in Doha continue around the specifics of a reduction in violence,"" a State Department spokesperson said on Tuesday. Taliban officials were not immediately available to comment.
In his tweet, Ghani wrote that Pompeo told him ""of the notable progress made in the ongoing peace talks with the Taliban.""
""The Secretary informed me about the Taliban's proposal with regards to bringing a significant and enduring reduction in violence,"" he continued, adding in another tweet, ""This is a welcoming development.""
Ghani, who did not disclose details of the proposal, appeared to take credit for the development, writing that ""our principal position on peace thus far has begun to yield fruitful results.""
Asked about Ghani's comments, Robert O'Brien, the White House national security adviser, reiterated that Trump was seeking to withdraw U.S. forces from the country, but said on Tuesday evening: ""I don't think there's any imminent withdrawal from Afghanistan.""
The Afghan president had called on the Taliban to agree to a nationwide ceasefire, a demand also made by Trump in September when he scuttled months of negotiations with the insurgents led by Afghan-born Zalmay Khalilzad, a U.S. special envoy.
The Taliban, however, steadfastly rejected the demand. In the talks that resumed in December in Doha, Qatar's capital, U.S. negotiators have pressed the insurgents to agree to a significant reduction in violence.
A former senior Afghan official with knowledge of the issue said on condition of anonymity that there had been ""a compromise by all sides.""
Ghani, he said, accepted a reduction in violence, buoyed by closer consultations by Khalilzad, a November visit to Afghanistan by Trump and a meeting with the U.S. president last month on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
That contrasts with Ghani's complaints last year about his government's exclusion from the Doha talks, which triggered serious tensions between Kabul and Washington.
The former senior Afghan official also said that the Taliban, who previously had proposed a limited lowering of violence, are anxious to make progress on an accord, and the Trump administration understood that the insurgents would not accept a nationwide ceasefire.
""We are cautiously optimistic that some good news (on Afghanistan) could be forthcoming,"" O'Brien said in Tuesday's remarks at the Atlantic Council. 
A U.S. troop withdrawal pact would be followed by talks between the Taliban and an Afghan delegation that included government officials on a settlement to decades of war, U.S. officials have said.

U.S. officials have said the U.S. troop level could drop to about 8,600 this year even if a withdrawal agreement is not reached.

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 06:41PM ET</span>",U.S. charges five with conspiring to violate oil sanctions on Iran,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday it had charged five people in Texas and New York with conspiring to violate a law on international commerce by arranging to purchase sanctioned Iranian oil and sell it to a refinery in China. 
The defendants include Daniel Ray Lane, president of privately held STACK Royalties, LLC a Texas-based company that sells oil and gas mineral rights to investment funds and private equity groups. 
The Justice Department charged the defendants with one count of conspiracy, and another for violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, based on allegations that from July 2019 to February 2020 they conspired to arrange for the purchase of oil from Iran for sale to an unnamed Chinese refinery. The charges also allege violations of U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. 
The five suspects, in addition to Lane, are Nicholas Haven of New York and Robert Thwaites, Nicholas Fuchs and Zhenyu Wang, also known as Bill Wang, of Texas. 
Lane offered to further the conspiracy by laundering money through STACK Royalties, the Justice Department said. STACK did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
China is the world's only major importer of Iranian oil despite sanctions President Donald Trump unilaterally reimposed on Tehran's petroleum exports in 2018 after withdrawing the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers.
""With the goal of illegally enriching themselves, the defendants conspired for over eight months to devise a scheme to violate U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran, particularly the ban on foreign oil sales,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers. 
The defendants agreed to use a Polish shell company as a straw seller of the illicit oil and planned two shipments of oil per month, according to the charges against them.
The Justice Department said Fuchs and Thwaites agreed to apply for foreign passports in order to set up offshore accounts that would not be reported to U.S. authorities. 
If convicted, the defendants each face a maximum sentence of 25 years and a fine of up to $1.25 million, the department said. It was not immediately clear if the five had hired lawyers to represent them.

The Mediterranean island launched the scheme offering passports for an investment in 2013, with more than 3,000 people gaining citizenship through the program.
A committee of experts from the Council of Europe, known as MONEYVAL, said in a report released on Wednesday that, although Cyprus had broadly taken measures to mitigate key money laundering risks, the risk of vulnerabilities in the investment program had increased ""exponentially"" via real estate, the investment vehicle of choice.
""These risks have not been properly mitigated,"" it said. ""The risks related to the Cyprus Investment Programme have not been assessed comprehensively.""
Although it did not elaborate, real estate is broadly known to be used by money launderers as a stable investment which can appreciate over time, and is normally subject to more limited scrutiny, according to a European Parliament research note issued in 2019.
Under the program, a minimum 2 million euro ($2.18 million) investment can get a passport and instant visa-free travel throughout the European Union, of which Cyprus is a member.
Supervision of the real estate sector should be significantly enhanced, the MONEYVAL report said, saying there should be more preventive measures by real estate agents.
While Cyprus was instrumental in assisting other countries, it was ""not very proactive"" at freezing and confiscating foreign criminal proceeds at its own initiative.
The review was conducted in May 2019. Based on the results of its evaluation, MONEYVAL decided to apply an enhanced follow up procedure and invited Cyprus to report back in 2021.
The total amount invested under the investment scheme was 6.64 billion euros between 2013 and 2018, the MONEYVAL report said, calling it ""material"" to the economy of Cyprus.
In November 2019 Cyprus said it would review the processes used to grant citizenships in the wake of a report by Reuters that Cambodian nationals in the inner circle of long-time leader Hun Sen had acquired passports..
It said it had introduced additional safeguards to the program since its inception to prevent abuses.
It also said it would start a process to revoke citizenship from 26 individuals. However Cypriot lawmakers told Reuters on Feb. 10 that the process had stalled on a legal technicality."

Stephanie Simpson, 32, has not been seen since she went for a hike last weekend at the Mount Aspiring National Park, home to one of New Zealand's highest peaks.
Police started looking for Simpson after she failed to keep an appointment on Monday and was reported missing.
""Search teams remained out in the area overnight,"" New Zealand police said in a statement.
""It is a large search area and much of it is difficult terrain,"" it added.
On Wednesday, drones with thermal imaging would be deployed in the area along with search and rescue teams on the ground and a helicopter, the police said.
Flash floods and incessant torrential rains hit New Zealand's South Island last week leaving several hundred tourists stranded for days and forced many residents to evacuate their homes.
It was not clear if Simpson's hike at the Mount Aspiring National Park was affected by the rains.

1161,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 05:19PM ET</span>","Palestinians' Abbas, at U.N., says U.S. offers Palestinians 'Swiss cheese' state","By Arshad Mohammed and Steve Holland
(Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, appearing before the United Nations Security Council, on Tuesday rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace proposal as a gift to Israel and unacceptable to Palestinians.
Waving a copy of a map that the U.S. plan envisions for a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, Abbas said the state carved out for Palestinians looked like a fragmented ""Swiss cheese.""
In a setback for the Palestinians, a draft Security Council resolution circulated by Tunisia and Indonesia that would have implicitly criticized Trump's plan, including Israel's retention of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, was not put to a vote.
The text, which faced a near-certain U.S. veto, did not go forward in part because it failed to garner the support needed by the Palestinians to isolate the United States, two diplomats at the United Nations said.
One said the draft, which the United States wanted to water down, attracted 11 or 12 votes in favor on the 15-member council. A second diplomat said it would have required too many compromises to achieve the 14-1 vote the Palestinians may have sought.
""Today, by not putting forward a polarizing resolution, the United Nations Security Council demonstrated that the old way of doing things is over,"" a senior Trump administration official said.
Released on Jan. 28, Trump's plan would recognize Israel’s authority over West Bank Jewish settlements and require Palestinians meet a difficult series of conditions for a state, with its capital in a West Bank village east of Jerusalem.
""This is the state that they will give us,"" said Abbas. ""It's like a Swiss cheese, really. Who among you will accept a similar state and similar conditions?""
Speaking at an election rally in the Israeli town of Bat Yam, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the criticism and hinted at the possibility that Arab states might entertain the Trump plan even if Palestinians do not.
""This is not Swiss cheese. This is the best plan that exists for the Middle East – for the Middle East – and for the State of Israel and for the Palestinians, too,"" he said, adding that the plan ""recognizes reality and the rights of the people of Israel, both of which you constantly refuse to recognize.""
Abbas urged Trump to disavow the plan and seek a return to negotiations based on existing U.N. resolutions that call for a two-state solution based on pre-1967 border lines.
""The U.S. cannot be the sole mediator,"" he said, rejecting the traditional U.S. role in seeking to broker an end to the conflict and calling for an international conference.
Suggesting violent protests could break out, Abbas said ""the situation could implode at any moment. ... We need hope. Please do not take this hope away from us."" 
Later, however, he said Palestinians would not ""resort to terrorism.""
Although Trump's stated aim was to end decades of conflict, his plan favored Israel, underlined by the Palestinians' absence from his White House announcement with Netanyahu at his side.
While Arab League foreign ministers on Feb. 1 rejected the plan, three Gulf Arab states - Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates - were represented at the White House announcement, suggesting they may be prioritizing ties with Washington and a shared hostility toward Iran over traditional Arab alliances.
Abbas said the deal is not an international partnership, but rather a proposal from one state supported by another state to be imposed on Palestinians.
Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, accused Abbas of being unrealistic and said peace was not possible while he remained in power. 
In a show of support for Abbas, Ehud Olmert, a former centrist Israeli prime minister who had claimed significant progress in talks with the Palestinians aimed at securing a final peace deal, later stood by him at a joint appearance. 
Olmert, once a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, resigned in 2008 and eventually spent 16 months in jail for corruption linked to his position as mayor of Jerusalem.
A Feb. 5-8 poll conducted in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that 94% of Palestinians reject the plan, which Trump has called the ""Deal of the Century.""

The Libyan National army (LNA) faction of Khalifa Haftar moved on Tripoli held by the internationally recognized government in April, failing to breach defense in southern suburbs but increasingly dragging civilians into the conflict.
Shells landed late at night in the central Nouflin and Souq al-Jumaa districts, which had been mostly spared so far from the conflict, a Reuters reporter said.
Parts of the capital were plunged in darkness as power failed. The electricity grid has been often hit.
There was no immediate word on casualties from authorities and no more details available. The war has displaced some 150,000 people, according to the United Nations.
Haftar is backed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Jordan, Sudanese and Chadian fighters as well as and most recently, Russian mercenaries. France has also given some support.

Matias Salazar, 56, was also accused of crimes including psychological violence, and sexual violence and sexual slavery of the 49-year-old woman identified only as Morella, prosecutors said in a statement.
""The perpetrator manipulated and deceived (Morella) so that she would leave her home"" three decades ago, prosecutors said, adding that Salazar was arrested in Maracay and is being held at a police station.
He had lived for years with another woman and his daughter in a building across the street from where Morella was held, according to Reuters interviews with 10 residents of either of the two buildings.
Several said they had not noticed anything out of the ordinary and that Salazar had always been friendly to them. They asked not to be identified for fear they would be accused of being complicit.
Salazar's lawyer Jose Briceno said in a press conference on Monday that his client was innocent and a victim of a media campaign, according to an internet broadcast of his statements.
Morella on Jan. 24 escaped from the apartment building and sought help at a branch of a state-run women's advocacy agency, prosecutors said.
The case was first brought to public attention on Feb. 5 when it was published by Venezuelan online news portal Cronica Uno.
Morella subsequently returned to the apartment in the company of prosecutors, according to neighbors.
""She had three changes of clothes inside that apartment, some old shoes, a twin bed on the floor, an old fan, an old TV,"" said one neighbor who entered the apartment with Morella and the prosecutors, and spoke on condition of anonymity.
""People attack the neighbors, asking why we did not report it, but we really did not know.""

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday announced the termination of a two-decade-old Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States (VFA), delivering on threats to downgrade an alliance important to U.S. interests.
The mercurial Duterte, who has clashed with the former colonial ruler over several issues, decided to pull the plug on the two-decade troop rotation pact to enable the Philippines to be more independent in its relations with other countries, spokesman Salvador Panelo said.
""The president will not entertain any initiative coming from the U.S. government to salvage the VFA, neither will he accept any official invitation to visit the United States,"" Panelo said in a statement. 
The decision, sparked by the revocation of a U.S. visa held by a former police chief who led Duterte's bloody war on drugs, could complicate U.S. military interests in the Asia-Pacific region as China's ambitions rise.
It would also limit Philippine access to U.S. training and expertise in tackling Islamist extremism, natural disasters and maritime security threats.
Panelo said Duterte's decision was a consequence of U.S. legislative and executive actions that ""bordered on assaulting our sovereignty and disrespecting our judicial system"".
The U.S. embassy in Manila called it ""a serious step with significant implications"".
""We will carefully consider how best to move forward to advance our shared interests,"" it said in a statement.
Given the importance of the alliance with the Philippines in broader U.S. strategy, Washington still hopes the decision will be reversed or delayed before it takes legal effect in 180 days.
In Washington, a senior Trump administration official voiced disappointment over the decision.
""The United States shares a long history with the government and people of the Philippines and recognizes that regional and global security is best served through the strong partnership that is enabled by the Visiting Forces Agreement,"" the official said. 
""We will continue to work with our Philippine government partners to strengthen this relationship in a way that benefits both our countries.""
The VFA is important to the overall U.S.-Philippines alliance and sets out rules for U.S. soldiers to operate in the Philippines. It underpins what Washington has called an ""ironclad"" relationship despite Duterte's complaints about U.S. hypocrisy, ill-treatment and ageing weapons.
Duterte says the United States uses the pacts to conduct clandestine activities like spying and nuclear weapons stockpiling, which he says risk making the Philippines a target for Chinese aggression.
Ending the VFA could hurt Washington's future interests in maintaining an Asia-Pacific troop presence amid friction over the presence of U.S. personnel in Japan and South Korea and security concerns about China and North Korea.
'WE MUST HAVE A SAY'
Some Filipino senators sought to block Duterte's move soon after news of it broke, arguing that without Senate approval he had no right to unilaterally scrap international pacts it had ratified.
""We must have a say on this important matter,"" said Senator Richard Gordon.
Some lawmakers are concerned that without the VFA, two other pacts would be irrelevant, namely the 2014 Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement made under the Obama administration, and a 1951 Mutual Defence Treaty.
Those cover dozens of annual military training exercises and broaden the access of U.S. forces and equipment to the Philippines, as well as bind the two countries to defend each other from external aggression.
Supporters of the agreements argue they have deterred Chinese militarization in the South China Sea and $1.3 billion of U.S. defense assistance since 1998 has been vital in boosting the capabilities of under-resourced Philippine forces.
Philippine nationalists, however, say the United States did nothing to stop China building islands in the South China Sea equipped with missiles, and say the VFA is lopsidedly favorable to Americans, including the granting of immunity from prosecution for U.S. servicemen.

Duterte, who favors closer ties with China and Russia, pressed ahead with the termination despite a Senate hearing on the VFA last week during which his senior generals and defense and foreign ministers spoke in favor of it.

In a vote on whether to allow the bill to proceed in the 350-seat parliament, 203 lawmakers voted in favor, 140 against and two abstained. The bill will be debated further before being subject to a final vote. 
After two previous attempts to change the law failed due to a lack of support and the premature end of the previous legislature last year, the government was able to achieve a majority through the support of the centre-right Ciudadanos and a handful of smaller parties.
""We're talking about clearly debilitating diseases without a cure, without a solution and which cause significant suffering,"" government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero said, adding that doctors who object to the practice will be able to opt out. 
Under the current law, helping someone end their life carries a jail term of up to 10 years, but 84% of Spaniards are in favor of decriminalization, according to a 2018 national opinion poll. 
Euthanasia involves a physician taking an active role in ending a patient's life whereas in assisted suicide the doctor provides a lethal substance for the patient to self administer. 
The Catholic Church - historically a lodestar for public opinion in Spain - considers euthanasia to be morally wrong, and the main conservative opposition People's Party (PP) and far-right Vox also want it to remain a criminal offense.
But the church's influence has been on the wane ever since Francisco Franco's dictatorship ended in 1975.
Vox spokeswoman Rocio Monasterio said her party would mount ""fierce"" resistance to the bill, which she said would allow people whose life was no longer considered useful to be ""eliminated"". 
Euthanasia has attracted much attention in Spain, which has one of the world's highest life expectancies, particularly since the 2004 film ""Mar Adentro"" (The Sea Inside) catapulted the issue into the national spotlight.
The film tells the story of how Ramon Sampedro, a paralyzed man who for decades campaigned for the legal right to die, committed assisted suicide after courts denied him that right.
Portugal is also debating legalizing euthanasia, while euthanasia and assisted suicide are allowed in Switzerland, the Netherlands and Belgium in certain circumstances and under strict local regulations.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors sought on Tuesday to reverse a controversial decision by Brazil's right-wing government to appoint a former evangelical missionary to protect isolated and recently contacted indigenous tribes in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The prosecutors said there was a conflict of interest in the appointment of Ricardo Lopes Dias as head of the department in charge of protecting indigenous tribes from contact with non-indigenous people because he was linked to a missionary group, the New Tribes, whose aim was to convert indigenous people to Christianity.
They asked a Brasilia court to suspend the appointment because it raises the risk of ""genocide and ethnocide"" among Brazil's 107 non-contacted or barely contacted indigenous groups living in the Amazon rainforest, the lawsuit said.
Dias, a theologian and anthropologist, was from 1997 to 2007 a member of the New Tribes, a group founded in the United States in 1942 and now called Ethnos360, whose mission is to evangelize indigenous peoples by translating the Bible into their language.
He was formally appointed last week to head the most sensitive department of the government's indigenous affairs agency Funai, which under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has defended the interests of farmers and ranchers in land conflicts with indigenous groups.
Bolsonaro has also unveiled a bill to allow mining on protected reservations, a move most indigenous leaders oppose as a threat to the survival of their communities and culture.
After taking office last year, the president picked a police officer to run Funai, Marcelo Xavier, a farm lobby appointee who has replaced most of the agency's experienced coordinators.
Contacted by telephone, neither Dias nor Funai responded immediately to requests for comment on the lawsuit.
Anthropologists, indigenous rights activists and other church groups have condemned his appointment, fearing it marked a departure from Funai's policy adopted in 1987 of not seeking out isolated indigenous groups and allowing them to decide if they wanted contact with Brazilian society or not.
""Putting an evangelical missionary in charge of the uncontacted Indians department of Funai is like putting a fox in charge of the hen house,"" Survival International said last week, warning that forced contact would destroy isolated tribes.
The group that advocates for tribal people's rights called the appointment, along with Bolsonaro' proposal for mining on reservations, ""a genocidal plan for the total destruction of the most vulnerable peoples on the planet."""

BRUSSELS/ROME (Reuters) - Italy is prepared to consider a resumption of maritime patrols in the Mediterranean, a senior official said, but diplomats said Austria is sticking to its objections, in a blow to European efforts to uphold a U.N. arms embargo on Libya.
The EU's military mission Operation Sophia stopped deploying ships last March after Italy, facing an anti-immigrant backlash, said it would no longer receive those rescued at sea.
Italy is ready to restart the sea patrols, the country's vice foreign minister told Reuters, but diplomats said Austria was still blocking the move, based on its position that people rescued on the high seas should not be taken to Europe.
Italy also insists the mission not focus on rescues while accepting the principle of renewed sea patrols, following a summit of world leaders last month in Berlin to seek a ceasefire among Libya's two rival governments.
""The reactivation of Operation (Sophia) is possible but with a profoundly revised mandate and a focus on the arms embargo in Libya,"" Italy's vice foreign minister Emanuela Del Re told Reuters on Tuesday.
However, diplomats said that despite weeks of negotiations, Austria's conservative government has retained its objections. The EU needs the support of all 27 member countries to restart the maritime patrols.
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz says Austria is a ""target country"" for migrants seeking a better life in Europe, similarly to Germany and Sweden and is opposed to the maritime patrols, arguing that rescuing people encourages more to come.
Diplomats said Vienna had rejected a compromise for the mission to resume in phases, starting with air surveillance over the sea, then moving into all Libyan airspace and then with a final phase using all available EU assets on air, land and sea.
At a news conference with his German counterpart Angela Merkel last week, Kurz said enforcing the U.N. embargo was ""possible from the air"". However, EU military commanders who briefed EU diplomats this month warned that anti-aircraft systems in Libya made such overflights increasingly risky.
The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell, who has warned the bloc it may become irrelevant if it cannot act more assertively, hoped to reach a deal to revive the maritime patrols on Feb. 17 at a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels.
Borrell noted in a speech to the European Parliament on Monday that Austria has ""major concerns"" about reviving a mission that many EU governments said had been effective in dissuading smugglers when first launched in June 2015.
Borrell told Italy's La Repubblica newspaper that a compromise was sea patrols away from the central Mediterranean and migrant routes, ""further to the east toward Benghazi, or even by the Suez canal. The arms come from the east."""
1169,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 02:01PM ET</span>",Bloomberg turns heads with write-in win in New Hampshire hamlet,"By Tim McLaughlin
DIXVILLE NOTCH, N.H. (Reuters) - Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's shadow over the Democratic presidential race grew a bit longer on Tuesday after his surprise write-in win in a hamlet that traditionally kicks off voting in New Hampshire's closely watched primary election.
The billionaire businessman, who is skipping the first four state nominating contests as part of a long-game strategy to win the party's nomination to face Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, received three of the five votes cast after the stroke of midnight by Dixville Notch residents. 
Bloomberg, the 77-year-old founder of the news company that bears his name, was not on the ballot in New Hampshire, where voters are faced with a list of 33 names - including top-tier candidates, former hopefuls who dropped out of the race and also-ran competitors lacking a national profile.
The ritual in Dixville Notch, dating back six decades, gives a candidate brief bragging rights, as state law does not require polls to even open until 11 a.m. 
Bloomberg's campaign was quick to seize the moment.
""We're not competing in NH, but Mike still wins Dixville Notch,"" his campaign said in an email with a link to a media story about the results from the town in the northern White Mountains near the Canadian border.
While the number of ballots cast there is tiny in the context of the full-state Democratic primary, which drew almost 250,000 voters in 2016, the victor in Dixville Notch has gone on to win two-thirds of the contested major party primaries in the state.
U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg are the front-runners in New Hampshire after their strong performances in the Iowa caucuses last week.
Sanders, who represents neighboring Vermont in the U.S. Senate, and Buttigieg each got a vote in Dixville Notch, where ballots were cast in booths draped with American flags in the main room of the Hale House on the grounds of the Balsams Resort. 
After the ballots were deposited in a wooden box with a padlock, the votes were counted and the results written on a white piece of plywood. Journalists from around the world crammed into the room to record the event. 
Unlike the chaotic and delayed results in Iowa last week, the ballots were counted by hand without any glitches. 
Les Otten, a registered Republican, said he voted for Bloomberg because he is a moderate and his agenda addresses climate change and the ballooning federal budget deficit.
""It's hard to be an outlier,"" Otten said. ""But I did what I had to do."" 
In a sign that Bloomberg's candidacy may be making waves, Trump posted a 2015 audio clip via Twitter of Bloomberg's use of a controversial policing strategy known as ""stop and frisk"" from his time as New York's mayor between 2002 and 2013.
""WOW, BLOOMBERG IS A TOTAL RACIST!"" Trump wrote in the since-deleted tweet.
Trump has also backed the same policing strategy.
Bloomberg apologized for his use of ""stop and frisk"" last November, a few days before announcing his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.

In a statement on Tuesday, Bloomberg cited what he called his commitment to criminal justice reform and racial equity, adding: ""In contrast, President Trump inherited a country marching toward greater equality and divided us with racist appeals and hateful rhetoric.""

Protesters wrapped in blankets were sitting on the pavement outside Azerbaijan's Central Election Commission (CEC) building when riot police detained all participants and put them on buses.
Police officials were not available to comment.
According to the CEC the ruling Yeni Azerbaijan (New Azerbaijan) party won 70 out of 125 seats in the single-chamber parliament, with nearly all other seats going to small parties and independents loyal to President Ilham Aliyev.
International monitors found widespread procedural violations in a vote count that they said raised doubt about the honesty of the election. Aliyev called the vote nine months early to consolidate his authority and speed economic reforms.
The opposition said the vote was marred by widespread violations, including ballot box stuffing.
""We demand the cancellation of the election results in all 125 constituencies and the arrest of all those responsible for violations,"" Rabia Mamedova, an independent candidate, told reporters at the protest, describing the demands of several opposition and independent candidates who lost to rivals from the ruling party."

Italy's growing demographic crisis, with births falling and life expectancy rising, is one reason for its chronically stagnant economy, and the situation is getting worse.
National statistics agency ISTAT said there were 435,000 births last year, down 5,000 on 2018 and the lowest level ever recorded in Italy. Deaths totaled 647,000 in 2019, some 14,000 more than the year earlier.
""This is a problem that concerns the very existence of our country,"" Mattarella said shortly after the data was released. ""The fabric of our country is weakening and everything must be done to counter this phenomenon.""
""As an old person I am well aware of the falling birth rate,"" added Mattarella, who is 78.
Italy's overall population fell by 116,000 to 60.3 million, with a steady rise in migrant and immigrant births helping to offset the declining domestic birth rate.
Many other European countries are suffering similar challenges, especially in ex-communist eastern Europe, while Germany has also seen a decline in domestic births partly offset by increased migrant and immigrant births.
Birth rates have held up better in France and Britain.
Italy's population had risen virtually every year since World War One, hitting a peak in 2015 at 60.8 million, but has since started to decline.
ISTAT said the gap between births and deaths was getting wider, with just 67 newborns last year for every 100 people who died. Ten years ago there were 96 births for every 100 deaths.
Life expectancy in Italy has continued to push up, hitting 85.3 years for women and 81 years for men -- one of the highest rates in Europe -- while the average age in Italy is now 45.7.
Successive Italian governments have promised to do more to boost births, but have so far failed to resolve the problem.
The current administration has offered lower income couples grants of up to 160 euros ($175) per month to help cover costs during the first year of a baby's life and also promised young families up to 3,000 euros a year to cover nursery charges.

The initiative, drawn up by a government commission, follows sweeping changes to Russia's political system proposed last month by President Vladimir Putin.
Putin's proposals, which were accompanied by a government reshuffle, would shift power away from the presidency and were widely seen as being designed to help him extend his grip on power after he leaves the presidency in 2024.
The lower house of parliament backed the changes in a preliminary vote last month. The commission's proposals will also be put to a vote.
Among them is a suggestion presidents become lawmakers for life in the upper house of parliament once their terms in the Kremlin end or they resign, Pavel Krasheninnikov, the working group's deputy head, said, Interfax news agency reported.
Under Russian law, lawmakers in the lower and upper houses of parliament are immune to criminal prosecution.
Krasheninnikov said the idea had been put forward by members of the working group and was based on their study of upper houses of parliament in other countries. He did not say the move was meant to shield former presidents from criminal prosecution.
He said it would allow Russia to tap into the ""colossal experience and knowledge"" of former presidents.
The commission has already put forward an array of other proposals, including one that would change Putin’s job description to Supreme Ruler.
Before they become law, the constitutional amendments must be approved by the lower house of parliament in two further votes before being voted on by the upper house, examined by regional parliaments, and then signed by Putin.
Putin has said the changes would be put to a nationwide vote, but it is unclear when that could take place."

Kramp-Karrenbauer said on Monday she would give up the party chair as well as her ambitions of running for chancellor, as she believed one person should do both. She would organize a process to fill both roles in the summer.
But Alexander Dobrindt, chief lawmaker of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), said the so-called ""Union"" conservative bloc must find a much swifter solution.
""In my opinion, such leadership questions must be resolved quickly,"" Dobrindt said. ""We need decisions now to make things clearer.""
CDU deputy leader Volker Bouffier also put Kramp-Karrenbauer's timetable into question. ""I don't think we're going to wait that long, we'll find a decision sooner,"" Bouffier told public radio broadcaster ARD.
CDU parliamentary group leader Ralph Brinkhaus warned that a prolonged leadership debate could hamper the ruling coalition's work. The party should not rush the decision, but definitely avoid a delay until autumn or even winter, he said.
Kramp-Karrenbauer had faced growing doubt over her suitability to replace Merkel, who has led Germany for 15 years but plans to stand down at the federal election due in autumn 2021.
Last week, Kramp-Karrenbauer's inability to impose discipline on the CDU in the eastern state of Thuringia dealt a further blow to her credibility, which had been eroded by a series of gaffes.
The regional CDU branch defied her by endorsing a local political leader helped into office by the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), shattering a postwar consensus among established parties on shunning the far-right."

In a bid to slash asylum claims, the administration of President Donald Trump launched an initiative in January 2019 that has forced more than 57,000 non-Mexican migrants to wait in Mexico for their U.S. immigration court hearings, under a program known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).
MPP, sometimes called Remain in Mexico, is among various overlapping U.S. policies aimed at discouraging asylum seekers. Critics say the program has put migrants, most of whom are fleeing violence and poverty in Central America, directly in harm's way.
""Those who have been returned to Mexico ... face serious risks and are systematically exposed to violence and potentially traumatic events,"" said the medical assistance group, also known by its French name, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
MSF said that in September 2019, nearly 44% of its patients sent to the Mexican border city of Nuevo Laredo under the MPP program had been kidnapped, and another 12% were victims of attempted kidnappings.
By October, the percentage of such kidnappings surged to 75%.
""According to the testimonies of these people, kidnappings could last several weeks, and they were occasionally forced to work for their captors,"" MSF said in its report.
Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said during a briefing in Washington on Tuesday that the findings of the report did not reflect his agency's understanding of the security situation for migrants sent to Mexico under the MPP program.
""Our staff has been to Mexico, I've been to Mexico,"" Morgan said. ""What I saw there is not what is being reported.""
Morgan said only the perpetrators should be held responsible for criminal acts.
""That's who we should be going after,"" he said.
Morgan said his agency was working with the Mexican government to better direct migrants to remain in shelters and not go to border encampments where they might be more vulnerable to victimization.
The Mexican government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
MSF said its teams had witnessed kidnappings right outside shelters used by migrants in the city and at bus stations, and that pregnant women in Nuevo Laredo preferred not to leave the shelter to go to hospital for fear of being kidnapped.
The vast majority of asylum seekers are attempting to escape violence and poverty in the region's so-called Northern Triangle, comprising Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
""The violence suffered by people living in the Northern Triangle of Central America is comparable to that in war zones where MSF has been working for decades,"" the organization said.
About 40% of the migrants and asylum seekers interviewed by MSF said they were violently attacked as they traveled through Mexico, while a further 27% said they were threatened or extorted.
""Central American asylum seekers and migrants find themselves with no way out, trapped by a series of barriers, in conditions that threaten their mental and physical health,"" MSF said.
The report was based on data and 480 interviews, mostly with people from the Northern Triangle, that the agency has conducted since January 2018, MSF said."
1176,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 12:07PM ET</span>",Venezuela makes civilian militia part of armed forces,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela has designated its civilian militia as part of the country's military, according to the nation's official gazette, an administrative change that on paper at least will vastly expand the armed forces that have been crucial in keeping President Nicolas Maduro in power.
The militia now stands as a branch of the armed forces alongside the army, navy, air force and national guard. Maduro in January said the militia has 3.7 million members, compared with around 150,000 active members of the other branches.
But the change does not appear to have a significant practical effect because the militia has existed since 2008 and its members do not have the same professional training as active members of the principal armed forces components.
Videos of militia training sessions routinely become the butt of social media jokes for appearing disorganized and being largely made up of senior citizens.
The militia will be expected to ""organize, equip, train and indoctrinate the people in order to contribute to the security of the nation,"" according the government's Official Gazette dated Feb 1 and seen by Reuters but not yet officially released.
The military has been crucial in allowing Maduro to retain power despite a hyperinflationary economic crisis that has led nearly 5 million people to migrate. Troops have participated in violent crackdowns of opposition protests and military intelligence been active in snuffing out potential uprisings.
The militia, created by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez as part of broad reorganization of the armed forces, has played a significantly less important role. Its members are often seen working as security guards at government offices such as hospitals or metro stations, and frequently appear at government rallies.
Maduro says the militia is a crucial element of the country's security in the face of potential aggression by the United States, which has imposed a broad sanctions program against his government in efforts to force him from power.
""The militia is the popular and armed wing of the people and the armed forces,"" Maduro said in a speech in January. In April, the president ordered the militia to get involved in agriculture to boost the country's food supply."

LONDON (Reuters) - Indian businessman Vijay Mallya launched an appeal in Britain's High Court on Tuesday against a 2018 decision to extradite him to India to face fraud charges resulting from the collapse of his defunct company  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines.
India wants to bring back Mallya, 64, whose business interests have ranged from aviation to liquor, over $1.4 billion in loans Kingfisher took out from Indian banks which the authorities argue he had no intention of repaying.
Mallya's lawyer, Clare Montgomery, said that the 2018 extradition ruling by Judge Emma Arbuthnot had ""multiple errors"" because she did not take into account all the evidence about the financial status of Kingfisher Airlines.
""This is not a Ponzi scheme - this is an airline,"" Montgomery said. ""Her assumption that she has an accurate evidential picture... is simply false.
In her 2018 judgment, Arbuthnot said that Indian banking officials might have been in ""the thrall of this glamorous, flashy, famous, bejeweled, bodyguarded, ostensibly billionaire playboy who charmed and cajoled"" them into ignoring their own rules and regulations.
Mallya was nicknamed ""the King of Good Times"" after the slogan of one of his premium beers and his hard partying lifestyle.
Montgomery sought to counter this image, saying that in seeking the loan to rescue his struggling airline he was not trying to ""make a quick buck"" and that the collapse was an ordinary business failure.
""Dr Mallya is not a fly-by-night figure,"" she said.
Mallya, who denies the charges against him and is currently on bail, sat with the public in the courtroom to watch the appeal, which is expected to last two days.
His extradition would be a huge win for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has faced pressure from political opponents to bring to justice several people who have fled India in recent years to escape prosecution, many for loan defaults.
In 2018, Arbuthnot rejected Mallya's argument that the case was motivated by political considerations, that he would not receive a fair trial in India and that extradition would infringe his human rights.

Bashir, who has been jailed in Khartoum since he was toppled after mass protests last year, is wanted by the ICC for alleged war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Information Minister Faisal Saleh did not specifically name him when announcing the move, but said the decision applied to all five Sudanese suspects wanted by the ICC over Darfur.
Bashir is one of the five suspects.
The government and the rebel groups reached an agreement during a meeting in South Sudan's capital Juba that included ""the appearance of those who face arrest warrants before the International Criminal Court"", said Mohamed al-Hassan al-Taishi, a member of Sudan's sovereign council.
Taishi also said that the two sides agreed to create a Darfur special court to investigate and hear cases including those investigated by the ICC.
That court would try Darfur suspects not indicted by the ICC, said Nimri Mohamed Abd, chief negotiator of the Darfur people in Juba. He said Darfur groups and Sudan's government had agreed to ""fully cooperate with the International Criminal Court"", and that the timing of the handover would be decided in final negotiations.
Bashir's lawyer said the ex-president refused to have any dealings with the ICC because it was a ""political court"".
Bashir has said the allegations made by the ICC, the world's first permanent court for prosecuting war crimes, are part of a Western conspiracy.
A spokesman for the ICC declined to comment. The Hague-based court issued its first arrest warrant for Bashir in 2009 - its first for a sitting head of state - and a year later issued a second one.
GENOCIDE CHARGES
Bashir faces five counts of crimes against humanity for murder, forcible transfer, extermination, torture and rape; two counts of war crimes for attacks against civilians; and three counts of genocide for killings and creating conditions meant to bring about the destruction of the targeted group, allegedly committed between 2003 and 2008 in Darfur.
Sudan's civilian government, which is running the country under a three-year transition with the military, has been seeking to make peace with rebels in Darfur and other neglected regions which had been fighting Bashir's government for years.
Darfur rebels and residents have long demanded that Bashir should be tried. Conflict spread in the impoverished western region in 2003 after mostly non-Arab rebels rose up against Khartoum. Government forces and mainly Arab militia mobilized to suppress the revolt were accused of widespread atrocities and genocide.
In Khartoum, where protesters gathered outside the prime minister's office to call for a faster transition, opinion was split on whether Bashir should be sent to The Hague.
""He should go straight to the criminal court because want peace in our country by any means,"" said one young woman who gave her name as Reem. ""If the (Darfur) movements want him to go, no problem. He's already a war criminal in their view.""
But another protester, Mowafeq Othman, said handing Bashir over would undermine Sudan's courts. ""Don't hand him over, this would mean Sudan's judiciary is weak - so long as he is a Sudanese citizen, regardless of anything else, he should be tried here,"" he said.
A Sudanese court handed Bashir a first, two-year sentence in December on corruption charges. He also faces trials or investigations over the killing of protesters and his role in the 1989 coup that brought him to power."

1180,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 11:07AM ET</span>",Tehran-backed Hezbollah steps in to guide Iraqi militias in Soleimani's wake,"(Reuters) - Shortly after Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq, the Tehran-backed Lebanese organization Hezbollah urgently met with Iraqi militia leaders, seeking to unite them in the face of a huge void left by their powerful mentor’s death, two sources with knowledge of the meetings told Reuters.
The meetings were meant to coordinate the political efforts of Iraq’s often-fractious militias, which lost not only Soleimani but also Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a unifying Iraqi paramilitary commander, in the Jan. 3 attack at Baghdad airport, the sources said.
While offering few details, two additional sources in a pro-Iran regional alliance confirmed that Hezbollah, which is sanctioned as a terrorist group by the United States, has stepped in to help fill the void left by Soleimani in guiding the militias. All sources in this article spoke on condition of anonymity to address sensitive political activities rarely addressed in public. Officials with the governments of Iraq and Iran did not respond to requests for comment, nor did a spokesperson for the militia groups.
The discussions shed light on how Iran and its allied groups are trying to cement control in the unstable Middle East, especially in the wake of the devastating U.S. attack on a revered Iranian military leader.
The Tehran-backed militias are critical to Iran’s efforts to maintain control over Iraq, where the U.S. still maintains some 5,000 troops. The country has experienced years of civil war since U.S. forces toppled Saddam Hussein and more recently, the government - and the militias - have faced growing protests against Iran’s influence in the country. Iran helped found some Iraqi militia groups.
In the months ahead of his death, Soleimani had waded ever deeper into the Iraq crisis, holding meetings with the Iraqi militias in Baghdad as Tehran sought to defend its allies and interests in its power struggle with the United States, one of the two Iraqi sources said.
Hezbollah’s involvement marks an expansion of its role in the region. The Shi'ite group, founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982, has been at the heart of Iran's regional strategy for years, helping Soleimani to train paramilitary groups in both Iraq and Syria.
One pro-Iran regional official said Hezbollah’s guidance of the militias would continue until the new leadership in the Quds Force – a unit of the Revolutionary Guards led by Soleimani since 1998 – gets a handle on the political crisis in Iraq.
The meetings between Hezbollah and Iraqi militia leaders began in January, just days after Soleimani’s assassination, the two Iraqi sources said. Reuters couldn’t confirm the number of meetings or where they took place. One source said they were in Beirut and the other said they were either in Lebanon or Iran.
Sheikh Mohammad al-Kawtharani, the Hezbollah representative in Iraq who worked closely with Soleimani for years to guide the Iraqi militias, hosted the meetings, the Iraqi sources said.
Kawtharani picked up where Soleimani left off, the Iraqi sources said. The sources said Kawtharani berated the groups, as Soleimani had done in one of his final meetings with them, for failing to come up with a unified plan to contain popular protests against the Baghdad government and the paramilitaries that dominate it. The government and militia groups have killed hundreds of protesters but not managed to contain the rebellion.
Kawatharani also urged a united front in picking a new Iraqi prime minister, the Iraqi sources said. Since then, former Iraqi communications minister Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi has been named - a development welcomed by Iran and accepted by the militia-linked parties it backs but opposed by protesters.
BIG SHOES TO FILL
For now, Kawtharani is seen as the most suitable figure to direct Iraqi militias until a permanent Iranian successor can be chosen, although he possesses nowhere near Soleimani’s clout and charisma, according to the two Iraqi sources and a senior Iraqi Shi’ite Muslim leader.
“Kawtharani has connections with the militia groups,"" the Shi’ite leader said, noting that he was born in Najaf, lived in Iraq for decades and speaks Iraqi dialect. ""He was trusted by Soleimani, who used to depend and call on him to help him in crises and in meetings in Baghdad.""
One of the Iraqi sources close to the militias said that Kawtharani also met with the Iraqi populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, a powerful but unpredictable figure, to convince him to support the new Iraqi prime minister. As Reuters has reported, Sadr has given Allawi his support.
Kawtharani will face serious - perhaps insurmountable- challenges in filling the shoes of the leaders killed in the drone attack, the Iraqi sources close to the militias told Reuters.
""A lot of faction leaders see themselves as too big and important to take orders from ” one Iraqi source said. “For now, because of pressure from Iran, they're cooperating with him, but I doubt that will continue and the Iranians know that.”
One of the pro-Iran sources, a military commander, said Hezbollah’s involvement would consist of political guidance but stop short of providing manpower and materiel to retaliate for the Solemani killing. The militias “do not need Hezbollah's intervention because they have the strength in numbers, combat experience and firepower,"" the commander said.
Those groups are difficult to control while Hezbollah is seen as more disciplined. But like the rest of Iran’s network, Hezbollah risks stretching itself thin, a senior U.S. official in the region and an Iraqi political leader said.
In recent years, Hezbollah’s role has grown considerably. It has fought in support of President Bashar Al-Assad in Syria and extended political support to the Iran-allied Houthis of Yemen in their war with a Saudi-led military alliance.
Iran is likely to rely partly on the clout Nasrallah, a figure who commands deep respect among Iran’s allies across the region, the U.S. official said. Nasrallah is seen as overseeing Kawtharani’s efforts, according to a senior Shi’ite Iraqi leader.
""I think ideologically, religiously, he’s seen as a charismatic figure to many of the Iraqi Shia militias,"" the U.S. official said, requesting anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record.
In two lengthy televised addresses, Nasrallah has paid homage to Soleimani and vowed to avenge his death.
He has also declared it a goal of Hezbollah and its allies to eject U.S. forces from the region once and for all. U.S. forces have been in Iraq since 2014 as part of a coalition fighting against Islamic State.
If the Iraqi militias have their way, sources close to them say, these troops will be the first to depart."

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's Fianna Fail and Fine Gael let Sinn Fein proceed with trying to form a government without them on Tuesday, a process most acknowledged would ultimately require two of the now three largest parties to work together.
Sinn Fein, a left-wing Irish nationalist party, stunned the establishment by winning the highest number of votes in Saturday's poll but its low number of candidates meant it finished between the two center-right parties by number of seats.
Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said her party ""won the election"" and would try to form a left-wing led government with smaller parties and independent lawmakers, technically possible but a task even some of her senior colleagues said was highly unlikely to succeed.
Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael and historical rival Fianna Fail, which have led every previous Irish government but fell to their lowest ever combined level of support, were also skeptical but happy to let others talk while they regrouped.
""Mary Lou McDonald is the leader of the party who got the most votes in the election and should now do what she says she's going to do,"" Health Minister Simon Harris of Fine Gael told national broadcaster RTE.
""She made a lot of promises, a lot of commitments, let her off now and see if she can try and form a government. If she can't, I do think there is an obligation on the center of Irish politics, which still won a hell of a lot of votes by the way.""
Fine Gael has strongly ruled out governing with Sinn Fein, citing policy differences and the nationalist party's role as former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
The IRA fought against British rule in Northern Ireland for decades in a conflict in which some 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace deal.
Harris said a pre-election offer of a first ever full coalition with Fianna Fail still stood.
UNCERTAINTY
Fianna Fail insisted it would not enter government with either party during the campaign, although its leader declined to repeat earlier outright refusals to consider Sinn Fein, saying only there were significant incompatibilities on policy.
There are open divisions over such a tie-up among Fianna Fail lawmakers, who won 38 seats to Sinn Fein's 37 in the 160-seat parliament. Fine Gael have 35 seats.
Analysts say it will eventually come down to whether Fianna Fail is willing to negotiate with Sinn Fein and if they can even then agree to a policy program its members would back. The process could take weeks or months, they say.
""The momentum is with Mary Lou McDonald, there's no doubt about that, but at some point Fianna Fail will have to make a crucial decision as to which way to go,"" said Theresa Reidy, a politics lecturer at University College Cork,
""If those kind of refusals continue, we are looking at a second election, although it is very unlikely any of the parties will want that. There are a lot of obstacles on the pathway to an arrangement (between Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein) too and that is why it is really very uncertain where we go from here."""
1182,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",Swiss investigate report that firm helped CIA break codes,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland is probing news reports that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and West Germany's spy service used a Swiss company's encryption technology to covertly crack other nations' top-secret messages, the Swiss defense ministry said on Tuesday.
The company, called Crypto AG, sold code-making equipment to Iran, Latin American nations, India, Pakistan and dozens of other countries. The technology was modified to let the CIA and Germany's BND break codes, the Washington Post reported along with German and Swiss broadcasters ZDF and SRF.
The reports cite a classified CIA history to underpin the allegations, some of which date back at least to 1992, when one of Crypto's employees was arrested and held in Iran for nine months as a suspected spy.
At the time, the company called reports that it was a secret asset of Western intelligence agencies ""an unbelievable conspiracy theory,"" according to a report in German magazine Focus detailing a 1994 book on the subject.
After being told late last year of fresh research about the company, the Swiss government in January appointed a former Swiss Supreme Court judge to scrutinize Crypto's activities ""to investigate and clarify the facts of the matter"", the defense ministry said in a statement.
""The events under discussion date back to 1945 and are difficult to reconstruct and interpret in the present day context,"" it added.
Judge Niklaus Oberholzer is due to report back by the end of June, after which the Swiss cabinet will be briefed.
The reports say at least four countries — Israel, Sweden, Britain and neutral Switzerland — knew of the operation, known as ""Operation Rubicon"", or were in on some of the secrets it unearthed.
According to one document attributed to the CIA history of the operation, the U.S. spy agency and its West German counterparts overcame cultural differences and divergent interests ""again and again, to fashion the most profitable intelligence venture of the Cold War"".
The company was liquidated in 2018. A successor company, Crypto International, owned by Swedish national Andreas Linde, said on its website the story was ""distressing"". The company was now under new ownership and had no connections to the CIA or German spy agency, it said.
The Post said another successor company, CyOne Security, also denied any involvement with foreign intelligence agencies.
Reuters was not immediately able to reach CyOne Security. An email to Crypto International received no immediate reply."

BANGKOK/HANOI (Reuters) - Thailand has barred passengers from Holland America's cruise ship MS Westerdam from disembarking, its health minister said on Tuesday, the latest country to turn it away amid fears of the coronavirus despite no confirmed infections on board.
The Netherlands-flagged ship was sailing west, 96 km (60 miles) off the southern coast of Vietnam on Tuesday morning, according to data from the Marine Traffic ship tracking website.
Holland America, owned by Miami-based Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp, had said on Monday that passengers would disembark in Bangkok on Feb. 13 and that there was no reason to believe anybody on board had the virus.
""I have issued orders. Permission to dock refused,"" Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
Thai Deputy Transport Minister Atirat Ratanasate said in a separate Facebook post that, while the ship would not be allowed to dock, Thailand ""will gladly help providing fuel, medicine, and food"" to the ship.
The coronavirus that emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last month has caused chaos in Asia and beyond with many flights suspended, businesses disrupted and entry restrictions imposed by governments trying to ward off the spread.
Another cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, with 3,700 passengers and crew onboard, is quarantined in the Japanese port of Yokohama, with 135 cases of coronavirus detected on the Carnival Corp-owned vessel.
The World Dream cruise ship was held up in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong for days after it was linked to three cases but all passengers and crew later tested negative and were allowed to disembark.
The virus has killed more than 1,000 people - all but two in China - and infected more than 40,000, most in China but including 319 cases in 24 other countries and territories.
The Westerdam had already been turned away from several ports, including in Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines, amid fears of the virus.
According to a World Health Organization (WHO) statement, Thai officials have said health authorities there may board the ship to conduct health checks on passengers first before granting permission to disembark.
VOYAGE TO NOWHERE
Holland America says no one on board has the virus. Media reports say it carries 1,455 passengers and 802 crew; its original destination was Yokohama, Japan, which refused it permission to dock.
""The ship is not in quarantine and we have no reason to believe there are any cases of coronavirus on board despite media reports,"" the company said.
It had earlier said the Westerdam was sailing towards Bangkok, and it is not immediately clear whether the ship would change course.
Holland America said it was aware of reports that Thailand planned to refuse permission for the Westerdam to dock there and was ""actively working"" on the matter.
""We know this is confusing for our guests and their families and we greatly appreciate their patience,"" the company said in a statement.
Some passengers on board the ship said they had not been told that the ship would be unable to dock in Thailand.
""(We) thought is was all finalised. Everyone has rebooked flights yet again! Now we are back in limbo,"" passenger Stephen Hansen told Reuters by email.
American tourist Angela Jones said passengers had been getting regular temperature checks but were becoming frustrated with the uncertainty."

AMMAN/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish-backed Syrian rebels on Tuesday struck back against Russian-supported government forces who had made gains in their campaign to eradicate the last rebel strongholds in northwest Syria. 
Earlier on Tuesday, the government forces seized control of the main Aleppo-to-Damascus highway running through Idlib province for the first time since 2012, a war monitor said. 
In response, the rebels shot down a Syrian military helicopter and advanced toward the town of Nairab, which the Turkish defense ministry said had been abandoned by Syrian government forces. 
A Turkish official said the rebels, supported by Turkish artillery, had begun ""a full-fledged attack"" on an area recently lost near Saraqeb, a strategic crossroads town on the M5 highway. A rebel commander told Reuters they were pushing back the government forces there. 
The flare-up of violence has prompted some of the most serious confrontations between Ankara and Damascus in the nine-year-old war in which Moscow and Tehran back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
Idlib's fate may well be decided by Turkey and Russia as much as by Assad.
Russian has officers on the ground advising the Syrians on the campaign and some ground forces, and Russian warplanes have carried out numerous air strikes.
Ankara has sent thousands of soldiers across the border to stem the Syrian offensive.
Relief agencies meanwhile said an exodus of hundreds of thousands of civilians from the afflicted areas was the largest such movement in the war and marked a new humanitarian crisis.
Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, says it cannot absorb any more. It said it will halt new refugee waves from Idlib and its military will remain there. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday the Syrian government would pay a ""very heavy price"" for attacking Turkish troops, including five killed on Monday and eight Turkish personnel killed a week earlier.
""We gave the necessary responses to the Syrian side at the highest level. Especially in Idlib, they got what they deserved. But this is not enough, it will continue,"" he said in Ankara, adding he would announce on Wednesday a detailed plan for Idlib. 
Talks in Ankara between Turkey and a Russian delegation ended on Monday without agreement on halting the clashes, a Turkish diplomatic source said.
Ankara told the Russians that attacks against Turkish posts must cease immediately and said it destroyed several Syrian government targets in retaliation. Erdogan has warned Turkey would drive back Assad's forces unless they withdraw by the end of the month.
The Kremlin said on Tuesday all attacks on Russian and Syrian forces in Idlib must stop. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin will discuss the situation with Erdogan by phone later on Tuesday, TASS news agency said.
The U.S. envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, is set to meet senior Turkish officials in Ankara on Wednesday and the U.S. Embassy there said they will discuss working together toward a political solution to the conflict.
AIR RAIDS 
Since the new push began in December, government forces have recaptured more than 600 square km of territory and in recent days taken control of dozens of towns and villages.
The rebels are a mix of nationalist factions and jihadists who have had deadly rivalries but are now closing ranks.
Last week government troops recaptured rebel-held Saraqeb, where Turkey had several military personnel stationed.
On Tuesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the government forces drove rebels from a foothold near Aleppo to capture the entire length of the M5 highway that connects Aleppo in the north to the capital Damascus then on to southern Deraa.
Aleppo, once Syria's economic hub, was the scene of heavy fighting between 2012 and 2016 which saw large-scale death and destruction.
Rescue teams said on Tuesday that Russian and Syrian war planes bombed several towns in Idlib, with most air raids in western Aleppo. At least 13 civilians were killed overnight in the air strikes, they said.
The rapid advances by Assad's forces in Idlib have driven nearly 700,000 people - most of them women and children - from their homes toward the closed-off Turkish border in the past 10 weeks.
""This is, from our initial analysis, the largest number of people in a single period since the Syrian crisis began almost nine years ago,"" Jens Laerke, spokesman for the United Nations' OCHA humanitarian agency, told reporters in Geneva. 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Andrej Mahecic said the harsh winter weather was making their suffering worse and shelter was hard to find.
""Even finding a place in an unfinished building is becoming nearly impossible,"" he said, adding that mosques were full.
Witnesses and rebels said a new column of Turkish reinforcements, including tanks, rocket launchers and armored vehicles, crossed the border into Idlib overnight.
One influential Turkish politician urged Erdogan to go further.
""There will be no peace in Turkey until Assad is brought down from his throne. Turkey must start plans to enter Damascus now, and annihilate the cruel ones,"" said Devlet Bahceli, chairman of Erdogan's nationalist partner party. 
The battle for Idlib is a crucial stage of a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of combatants and civilians, made millions refugees in their own country or overseas, and fractured the wider Middle East since it broke out amid the Arab Spring in 2011.
Moscow's military intervention in 2015 helped swing the war decisively in favor of Assad, Syria's ruler for nearly 20 years, but he now presides over a devastated country.

1185,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 09:19AM ET</span>","Germany may face early Merkel exit, election after protegee stands aside","By Madeline Chambers
BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's plan for an orderly succession is in ruins and the chances of an early election in Germany have risen after her conservative protegee, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, gave up her ambitions for the top job.
Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) will in the coming months choose who they want to lead the party and run as chancellor in the next federal election, due by October 2021. The same person will probably, but not necessarily, hold both posts.
It is to early to forecast how the situation will play out, but following are three possible scenarios.
1. MERKEL OUT, NEW ELECTION WITHIN SIX MONTHS
Merkel, an anchor of stability in Europe's biggest economy during her nearly 15 years in office, has said she will not seek re-election and stood down as party chair in 2018, handing over to Kramp-Karrenbauer.
But with the new possibility of a rival as party leader following Kramp-Karrenbauer's exit, Merkel might be forced to stand down early, which could prompt her Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners to walk away and trigger a snap election.
Pressure to get the issue sorted out quickly and to have the same person fill both posts could bode ill for Merkel.
Leading contenders for the CDU party chair and to be the chancellor candidate of the conservative ""Union"" alliance, compromising the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, Christian Social Union (CSU), are already circling.
Several senior conservatives, including CSU chief Markus Soeder, have urged the CDU to decide on its leadership soon, arguing that dragging out a contest until a party conference in December would hit the Union's poll ratings.
Support for the CDU in the eastern state of Thuringia has plummeted by nearly 9 percentage points since its lawmakers last week broke a post-war taboo and voted with the far right to install a state premier. Nationally, support is also ebbing.
Concern over such a decline might mean that the CDU acts by the summer or early autumn to choose a new leader and chancellor candidate such as Friedrich Merz, a long-time arch-rival of Merkel, with whom the chancellor may find it impossible to work.
For its part, the SPD may refuse to work with right-wingers Merz or Jens Spahn - especially if one of them was to replace Merkel as chancellor before an election - and pull the plug on the coalition, sending Germany to the polls.
2. MERKEL STAYS THROUGH EU PRESIDENCY; ELECTION EARLY 2021
Stability-loving Germans, however, prefer gradual change and want to avoid voting in the middle of Germany's presidency of the European Union in the second half of 2020.
Many conservative and Social Democratic lawmakers would like Merkel to play a leading role in negotiations with post-Brexit Britain and in shaping EU relations with China which will be top of the EU agenda in the presidency.
Merkel has declared she is looking forward to the EU presidency where she can employ her negotiating skills and deep experience in EU affairs - from the euro zone debt crisis to the 2015 influx of migrants. The presidency could help the conservatives show off their credentials ahead of an election.
Another factor is Merkel's largely undiminished popularity. Pollsters say many voters view her almost as a presidential figure and would prefer her to serve a full term.
All of this increases the chances of Merkel staying at least until the end of the year but could also allow a new leader to benefit from a bounce in the polls.
3. MERKEL SERVES FULL TERM, ELECTION IN AUTUMN 2021
Even if the CDU makes its leadership decisions quickly, some candidates could work with Merkel until the end of her term although she would be something of a lame duck.
Continuity candidate Armin Laschet, premier of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, is one such candidate and as a centrist would probably also be acceptable to the SPD.
This could also be the case if the conservatives pick Bavaria's Soeder to run as chancellor.
Although many regard Soeder as a strong candidate, no CSU leader has yet been German chancellor."

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Fuel shortages have left motorists in Sudan skipping work to queue for petrol and forced the transitional government to introduce a rationing system as it tries to manage acute economic pressures.
Some people have been spending entire days in queues that stretch for several km (miles) since the fuel crisis began late last week. Coming on top of bread shortages it has piled more pressure on a government struggling to deliver improvements after the overthrow of former President Omar al-Bashir last April.
""I go from the bread queue to the petrol queue and from the petrol queue to the gas queue,"" said Ali Abdallah, waiting with his motorbike outside a petrol station in the center of the capital, Khartoum. ""Our lives are spent going from one queue to the other.""
The government is working under a three-year power sharing deal between the military and civilians and is battling with the legacy of decades of economic sanctions and mismanagement that hampered infrastructure development and investment.
It also inherited a generous subsidy system under which petrol costs just 6.17 Sudanese pounds per liter (about 12 U.S. cents at official rates, or 6 cents at black market rates) and diesel 4.14 pounds per liter.
Officials have talked about moving toward cash transfers, but still have to negotiate a plan for subsidy reform and overcome technical challenges to administer the payments.
They say the current problem is caused by a broken refinery pipeline that they are working to fix, though it is unclear how long this will take. Imports and distribution of fuel have been restricted by foreign currency shortages and a lack of road transport and port capacity.
BLACK MARKET
The shortage has given rise to a black market, and officials announced on Monday that fuel would be rationed at four gallons per vehicle for two days.
""Supplies are continuing, there is no need to panic,"" Energy Minister Adel Ibrahim told reporters.
Though there have been occasional fuel shortages before and after last year's uprising, some motorists say the current one is the worst yet.
Taxis are hard to find and drivers have sharply raised their prices to compensate for the time they spend queuing for fuel.
At the Khartoum petrol station the queue snaked for at least a kilometer onto a side road, passing a bakery where a small crowd was queuing for bread.
Another queue for diesel cut through some residential blocks whilst closer to the pumps, motorbikes and motorized rickshaws fanned out in separate lines.
Some drivers pushed cars that had run out of fuel.
""The government needs to find a solution,"" said computer engineer Moussa Ali Moussa, who had come from Khartoum's twin city Omdurman to search for fuel. ""A car can't run without petrol, right?"""

GENEVA (Reuters) - More people have fled fighting in Syria over the past 10 weeks than at any other time in the 9-year-old conflict and the city of Idlib, where many are sheltering, could become a graveyard if hostilities continue, two U.N. agencies said on Tuesday.
Syrian government forces are shelling their way northwards, backed by Russian air strikes, driving people toward the Turkish border as they try to seize remaining rebel strongholds near Idlib and Aleppo.
Turkey, which backs the rebels and is fearful of additional refugees, has retaliated militarily, with displaced civilians caught in between.
""It's the fastest growing displacement we have ever seen in the country,"" Jens Laerke from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said, adding that nearly 700,000 people had fled since December, mostly women and children.
Another 280,000 people could flee from urban centers if fighting continues, including from the city of Idlib, which is packed with people who have escaped fighting elsewhere and which has not yet seen a full military assault on its center.
""It has the world's largest concentration of displaced people and urgently need a cessation of hostilities so as not to turn it into a graveyard,"" Laerke added.
Of Syria's 17 million people, 5.5 million are living as refugees in the region, mostly in Turkey, and a further six million are uprooted within their own country.
Civilians are struggling to find shelter, amid harsh winter conditions with snow, rain and wind from Storm Ciara. Mosques are full and makeshift camps are overcrowded, said Andrej Mahecic, a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency.
""Even finding a place in an unfinished building has become nearly impossible,"" he told journalists in Geneva, describing the humanitarian crisis as ""increasingly desperate"".
OCHA has sent 230 trucks over two authorized border crossings in Turkey so far this month, containing food, water and hygiene equipment, Laerke added. Last month, 1,227 trucks were shipped in the biggest cross-border aid operation there since the operation started in 2014.
The U.N. Security Council renewed a six-month program delivering aid to civilians in January but stopped crossings from Iraq and Jordan to avoid a veto from Russia which backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Aid workers say that is restricting their ability to help the displaced."
1190,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 08:07AM ET</span>","Two more arrested over Vietnamese truck deaths, UK police say","LONDON (Reuters) - British police said on Tuesday that two more arrests had been made over the deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants found in the back of a truck near London last year while investigations indicated they had died of overheating and lack of oxygen.
The victims, who included two 15-year-old boys, were found on an industrial estate in Grays in Essex, about 20 miles (32 km) east of London in October.
Mostly from Nghe An and Ha Tinh provinces in north-central Vietnam, their deaths shone a light on the human smuggling trade.
Autopsies had concluded that the provisional cause of death was a combination of hypoxia - oxygen deprivation - and hyperthermia - overheating - in an enclosed space.
Essex Police said a 22-year-old man had been arrested in Northern Ireland on Sunday on suspicion of manslaughter and facilitating unlawful immigration. He was now in custody in Essex.
Last week, British police along with German authorities detained Gheorghe Nica, 43, who was wanted on a European Arrest Warrant, at Frankfurt Airport.
Nica, who lives near Grays, appeared in court on Saturday accused of 39 counts of manslaughter and one count of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and is due to reappear at London's Old Bailey court on March 16.
""Our teams are continuing to progress hundreds of lines of enquiry and are working with the National Crime Agency and other law enforcement agencies from across the globe to further their lengthy and complex investigation,"" Essex Police said.
Maurice Robinson, the British driver of the truck who hailed from Northern Ireland, admitted last November plotting to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring criminal property.
British authorities are also trying to extradite Eamonn Harrison, 23, from Ireland on charges of manslaughter, human trafficking and immigration offences. He is due at Dublin's High Court on Wednesday.
Police have said the Vietnamese victims were found not long after the container arrived in Britain from Zeebrugge in Belgium. The refrigerated unit was picked up at Purfleet dock, not far from Grays, while police believe the truck cab was driven over from Ireland."

President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Dmitry Kozak, deputy head of the Russian presidential administration, was now the most senior Kremlin official when it came to Ukraine.
Kozak, a lawyer by education, was born in what used to be Soviet Ukraine.
Vladislav Surkov, seen as a hardliner by many in Kiev, had previously overseen Russia's relations with Ukraine, a role that saw him negotiate and advise Putin on the subject. Peskov said Surkov still worked for the Kremlin, but did not elaborate.
Relations between Moscow and Kiev were derailed after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and Moscow-backed separatists launched an uprising in Donbass, eastern Ukraine, that has killed more than 13,000 people. Russia denies any role in the conflict.
Russia and Ukraine are wrangling over how to implement a peace deal on Donbass, but major disagreements remain and full normalization is far off.
Under Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, there has been some movement however with a peace summit held in Paris in December with the leaders of Russia, France and Germany. That was followed by a large-scale prisoner swap.
Zelenskiy on Tuesday appointed a former lawyer called Andriy Yermak as his chief of staff.
Yermak, who was involved in negotiating prisoner swaps with Russia, told the Ukraine 24 TV channel on Monday that he had met Kozak and thought he was an improvement on Surkov.
""It seems to me that he (Kozak) is more inclined to dialogue. And on the issues on which I spoke with him, I can say that we had constructive communication, without which nothing would be possible of what we have already seen,"" Ukraine's UNIAN news agency cited Yermak as saying."

JAKARTA/BOGOR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia is not hiding anything over the coronavirus, the health minister said on Tuesday, after some medical researchers expressed concern that cases may have gone undetected in the world's fourth most populous country.
While the virus has quickly spread from China throughout much of the rest of the region and beyond, the sprawling Southeast Asian country of more than 260 million people has not recorded any cases so far.
Dozens of cases have been recorded in other regional countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, where one person has died, raising suspicions on social media in particular over a potential lack of vigilance in Indonesia.
Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in the United States, then said in a study last week that Indonesia should rapidly strengthen outbreak surveillance and control - especially given that it had direct flights from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus.
The Harvard team said that Indonesia's lack of confirmed cases ""may suggest the potential for undetected cases"" as air travel may contribute to cases being exported from China.
The virus has killed over 1,000, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases in China and 319 cases in 24 other countries. Many of the cases outside China have been in people who have a history of travelling to the country.
""We have the kits to check coronavirus and they're certified ... Nothing is concealed,"" Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto said after a cabinet meeting at the Bogor presidential palace outside Jakarta, in response to the concerns. 
Indonesia has tested 64 samples from suspected coronavirus infections - 62 of which were declared negative with two still being tested, health ministry Research and development agency head Siswanto said during a tour of its laboratory in Jakarta.
Navaratnasamy Paranietharan, the WHO's Indonesia representative, told a conference on Tuesday: ""Indonesia has taken concrete measures and the World Health Organization is quite confident that Indonesia is ready to be able to respond to this situation.""
Indonesia has barred entry to visitors who have been in China for 14 days and stopped all flights to and from there.
Vivi Setiawaty, another health ministry official, said it was unclear why Indonesia had not seen any cases but said authorities were better prepared since facing H5N1 avian influenza from 2005. ""We remain cautious,"" she told reporters.
Indonesia has readied 100 hospitals across the archipelago including three in Jakarta and has also quarantined more than 240 of its citizens evacuated from Hubei province, home to Wuhan, to the island of Natuna, north of Borneo.
The WHO's Paranietharan said it appeared unlikely, as some have suggested, that the hot tropical climate could be a factor in curbing cases though more data would be required to be sure.

""It doesn't make sense at this point whether that could be the reason why we don't have coronavirus cases in Indonesia,"" Paranietharan said.

1193,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 07:43AM ET</span>",NATO willing to expand Iraqi training mission to meet Trump demand,"By Robin Emmott
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO is considering an increase to its training mission in Iraq to relieve the burden on the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, senior officials and diplomats said on Tuesday.
NATO and the coalition have non-combat ""train-and-advise"" missions which aim to develop Iraqi security forces but both are suspended over fears for regional stability after a U.S. drone strike killed a top Iranian commander in Baghdad on Jan. 3.
After the killing, U.S. President Donald Trump called on NATO - founded in 1949 to contain a military threat from the Soviet Union - to do more in the Middle East but he has not specified publicly what that might entail.
NATO defense ministers including U.S. Secretary of State Mark Esper will discuss options for non-combat operations in the Middle East at a two-day meeting in Brussels starting on Wednesday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.
""We are discussing what more NATO can do,"" he told reporters, adding that the alliance would first seek to restart the training with the Iraqi government's blessing.
U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison said the alliance was also seeking military advice, both from NATO and Iraq, on how to increase the mission, but gave no details.
""I think it will definitely be the answer to what President Trump has requested,"" she said.
NUMBER OF TRAINERS SET TO RISE
Established in Baghdad in October 2018, the NATO training mission in Iraq numbers some 500 personnel. It does not deploy alongside Iraqi forces during their operations.
Two allied diplomats told Reuters the number of NATO trainers in Iraq could rise to as much as 2,000, but it would not be a net increase of Western troops in Iraq because the U.S.-led coalition would simply re-assign trainers.
While symbolic, the coalition is outside NATO structures. Putting more personnel under a NATO flag would solidify training in Iraq and could make it more long-term, also cementing NATO's presence in the region.
When Trump first raised increasing NATO's role in the Middle East in 2017, France and Germany resisted, worried that NATO would be caught up in another costly, Afghan-style deployment, anger Arab countries or risk confrontation with Russia in Syria.
But diplomats said Paris and Berlin were now open to an expanded NATO mission in Iraq because it was non-combat, held fewer risks, would not be under a U.S. general's command and would go some way to mollifying Trump, a sharp critic of NATO."
1194,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 07:43AM ET</span>",Britain moves to end early release of convicted terrorists,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will end the automatic early release of convicted terrorists under new fast-tracked legislation to be introduced to parliament on Tuesday.
The legislation follows an attack earlier this month by an Islamist militant just days after he was set free half-way through his jail term, despite authorities believing he still posed a threat to the public.
The government had already promised tougher rules on terrorism after another former convict killed two people and wounded three before being shot dead by police near London Bridge in November.
The emergency measures, which the government wants to become law by the end of the month, will mean convicted terrorists cannot be released before the end of their sentence without an assessment of whether they are still a risk.
""No dangerous terrorist should be released automatically only to go on to kill and maim innocent people on our streets,"" said justice minister Robert Buckland in a statement.
""Enough is enough. This government will do whatever it takes to keep the public safe, including making sure no terror offender is released early without a thorough risk assessment by the Parole Board.""
The government said around 50 people currently in jail would see their release blocked as a result of the change to the law, which will also apply to those sentenced for crimes including training for terrorism and the dissemination of terrorist publications.
Under the new law, they will have to serve at least two-thirds of their sentence before being assessed.
The government said it also plans to boost deradicalization measures in prison, introduce a minimum 14-year term for the most serious terror offenders and increase funding to police to deal with terrorism."

DHAKA (Reuters) - Dozens of Rohingya refugees were missing and 15 were confirmed dead on Tuesday after a ship carrying about 130 people capsized in the Bay of Bengal while trying to reach Malaysia, a Bangladesh coast guard official said.
Rescuers had saved 73 people from the vessel, which had set sail early on Tuesday packed with refugees trying to make their way to Malaysia from camps near the resort town of Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh, said the official, Hamidul Islam. 
""It was inhumane,"" he said. ""The boat was carrying roughly 130 people, while it had a capacity of 50.""
""The chance of finding anyone else alive is pretty slim, but we cannot give up. We are continuing search operations,"" Islam said.
Some of the survivors said a second vessel carrying a similar number of passengers had also set off at the same time, Islam said. Coast guards had so far been unable to locate the second vessel.
""I wanted to go to Malaysia for a better life. I wanted to live with my husband,"" said Rajuma Akhtar, one of the women who were rescued, told media on Tuesday. Akhtar said her husband had gone to Malaysia five years ago. 
Two Bangladesh naval vessels and two coast guard ships were involved in joint rescue operations, near Saint Martin's Island off the southeastern tip of Bangladesh. Those rescued include 46 women, 24 men and three children. The confirmed dead were women and children, Islam said.
In 2017, a crackdown by Myanmar's military drove more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. Buddhist-majority Myanmar has denied U.N. accusations that its military waged a campaign against Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"".
In a statement, humanitarian agency Save the Children dubbed the tragic accident on Tuesday a ""wake up call"". It urged the Myanmar government to take all necessary steps to ensure the Rohingya can return to their homes in a safe and dignified manner. 
In November, Bangladesh's coast guard rescued 122 Rohingya Muslim refugees from the Bay of Bengal when a vessel they had boarded to travel to Malaysia started sinking because of a mechanical problem.
Malaysia is home to more than 100,000 Rohingya refugees, the second largest number in the world after Bangladesh.
Lured by traffickers, hundreds attempt the perilous voyage to Malaysia on overcrowded, rickety vessels during the November-to-March window, when sea conditions in the region are usually calm. Others try to make their way to Malaysia by paying people smugglers for fake travel documents.
Authorities in Bangladesh last year prevented more than 600 Rohingya, including many young girls, from making perilous sea voyages, mostly to Malaysia. Last year at least seven suspected human traffickers, including two Rohingya refugees, were killed in clashes with police in Cox's Bazar.
""We are continuing our drive to prevent human trafficking,"" said Iqbal Hossain, additional police superintendent in Cox's Bazar.

1196,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 07:29AM ET</span>",Not just Chinese travellers staying away as virus shakes Asian tourism,"By Matthew Tostevin and Aradhana Aravindan
BANGKOK/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - As a driver of one of Thailand's renowned ""tuk tuk"" motorised rickshaws, Amonchai Laodoungdee is used to busy days ferrying tourists around Bangkok, but on Tuesday he waited for four hours at a shopping mall without a single customer.
Since word of the new coronavirus spread from China last month, he's seen his daily income drop from about 1300 baht ($41) per day to around 400 baht. At first, he noticed not as many Chinese tourists were around. Now, there are few tourists from any country.
""Not too many foreigners come to visit Thailand now,"" Amonchai said. ""Now is very difficult.""
Such laments are becoming more common across Asia's tourism industry, from street food hawkers to luxury tour operators, as more countries advise citizens to be cautious as the coronavirus toll surpassed 1,000 deaths, most of them inside China.
Many Asian tourism professionals say the drop in tourism has spread from Chinese tourists to visitors from other Asian and Western countries now also staying away, raising fears that much of the 2020 travel season may be severely diminished.
""It's not just China. Travellers from other countries are also postponing or cancelling visits not just to Singapore, but we are seeing evidence across Asia,” Keith Tan, chief executive of the Singapore Tourism Board, told reporters.
Some tourism officials says the market is resilient and may well bounce back once the virus is contained.
Still, as the number of total confirmed cases surpassed 40,000 this week, many worried that the slump would continue for months.
""We forecast an overall decline of up to 50% in the number of bookings for the first half of the year, compared with same period last year,"" Alicia Seah, director of communications at travel agency Dynasty Travel, based in Singapore.
SHARP DECLINE
Tourism-heavy economies like Thailand, which derives around 12% of its GDP from foreign visitors, are especially affected by travel restrictions and warnings.
""Today the impact has not been just on Chinese tourists but on all tourists,"" Chairat Triratanajaraspon, president of the Tourism Council of Thailand, told Reuters.
The Tourism Authority of Thailand has predicted a revenue loss of 95 billion baht ($3.05 billion) from fewer Chinese tourists from January to April, but that number could rise higher as travellers from other countries are now staying away.
The decline has been swift and sharp. From Feb. 1 to Feb. 10, arrivals booked by the Association of Thai Travel Agents dropped by were down 71 percent from last year overall and 99 percent from China, according to the associations.
Chairat said 50-60% of the usual 3 million expected tourists for February are expected to now stay away, adding ""This situation is likely to continue into March.""
In Indonesia, the tourist island of Bali alone has seen 20,000 cancellations, said Hariyadi Sukamdani, head of Indonesia’s hotels and restaurants association.
He did not know how many were from Chinese tourists or from other countries, but he said there is concern of a sustained slump because from now until April is usually when bookings for summer holidays usually are made.
""IN THE TOILET"" 
In Vietnam, cancellations are coming in for well into the year.
The official state-run Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said last week that many inbound tours to Vietnam scheduled for March and April had been cancelled. 
The Vietnam National Administration of Tourism estimated the damage to Vietnam’s tourism sector from the virus will range from $5.9 billion to $7.7 billion, VN Express reported on Friday.
A tourism source in Hanoi, who did not wish to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation, said hotels were suffering from a 20% drop in budget in terms of occupancy. 
""It's really pretty bad. We are re-forecasting now. But February and March are of course in the toilet.”
Thai tour operator Virat Chatturaputpitak, managing director of Marwin Tours (Asia) Co. Ltd., said he has seen a reduction of tourists from Canada, the United States, and also the United Kingdom.
""For me, the Easter outlook in April is also not good,"" Virat said.
""We simply don't know how long it will take to contain this virus and every day the news of more infection mean more people are reluctant to travel,"" he added.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Coronavirus outbreak may be over in China by April - expert,"By David Kirton
GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak is hitting a peak in China this month and may be over by April, the government's senior medical adviser said on Tuesday, in the latest assessment of an epidemic that has rattled the world. 
In an interview with Reuters, Zhong Nanshan, an 83-year-old epidemiologist who won fame for combating the SARS epidemic in 2003, shed tears about the doctor Li Wenliang who died last week after being reprimanded for raising the alarm.
But Zhong was optimistic the new outbreak would soon slow, with the number of new cases already declining in some places.
The peak should come in middle or late February, followed by a plateau and decrease, Zhong said, basing the forecast on mathematical modelling, recent events and government action. 
""I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April,"" he said in a hospital run by Guangzhou Medical University, where 11 coronavirus patients were being treated.
Though his comments may soothe some global anxiety over the coronavirus - which has killed more than 1,000 people and seen more than 40,000 cases, almost all in China - Zhong's previous forecast of an earlier peak turned out to be premature. 
""We don't know why it's so contagious, so that's a big problem,"" added Zhong, who helped identify flaws in China's emergency response systems during the 2002-03 SARS crisis.
He said there was a gradual reduction in new cases in the southern province of Guangdong where he is based, and also in Zhejiang and elsewhere. ""So that's good news for us."" 
With China taking unprecedented measures to seal infected regions and limit transmission routes, Zhong applauded the government for locking down Wuhan, the city at the epicentre which he said lost control of the virus at an early stage.
""The local government, local healthcare authority should have some responsibility on this,"" he said. 
""Their work had not been done well.""
The virus is believed to have originated in early December in a Wuhan seafood market where wildlife was illegally sold. 
'HERO OF CHINA' 
Local authorities have also come under fire for their heavy-handed treatment of the late doctor Li, who was reprimanded by police in early January for ""spreading rumours"" about the disease before becoming its best-known fatality last Friday. 
""The majority of the people think he's the hero of China,"" Zhong said, wiping tears. ""I'm so proud of him, he told people the truth, at the end of December, and then he passed away.""
Behind him stood hundreds of other doctors all wanting to tell the truth and now being encouraged by the government to do so, he said. ""We really need to listen,"" he said. 
The virus has now infected more than 40,000 people on the Chinese mainland and spread to at least 24 countries. 
Zhong, who said the government's unwillingness to share information prolonged the SARS crisis, said Beijing had done much better this time on issues like transparency and cooperating with the World Health Organization (WHO).
But more should be done, he said, including an end to wildlife trade, better international cooperation on hygiene technology, improved operation of disease control centres, and a global ""sentry"" system to warn of potential epidemics. 
""If we have better cooperation and coordination, we can find it earlier and figure out the human-to-human transmission earlier,"" he said during the roughly 90-minute interview, adding that the outbreak would not be quite so serious if such a system was in place.
Zhong said uncertainties remained about how the coronavirus was infecting patients, if it can spread via faeces and whether so-called ""superspreaders"" were helping transmit the disease.
So far, China's data shows the recovery rate to be quite low, with less than 10% of confirmed patients discharged, but Zhong said authorities were leaving nothing to chance, with many patients still quarantined in wards now reasonably healthy.
""They didn't know if they were going to re-infect or not... so that's why the cure rate up to now is not that high.""
Wearing masks outside contagion zones was not always necessary, he said, and the United States' and others' entry ban on Chinese was an over-reaction. Furthermore, it appeared children were less vulnerable, he added.
Global, apolitical cooperation was crucial, Zhong said. 

""I think maybe we should be going closer, I mean in particular our colleagues and scientists, and have more cooperation,"" he said. ""We're just dealing with the disease - nothing to do with the political, nothing.""

1198,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>",Government troops seize highway in northwest Syria as Turkey-Russia talks end inconclusively,"BEIRUT/ANKARA (Reuters) - Government forces seized control of a highway in northwest Syria for the first time since 2012 on Tuesday as they pressed their campaign to eradicate the last rebel strongholds in Idlib province and the Aleppo countryside, a war monitor said.
In Ankara, talks between Turkey and Russian ended without agreement on stopping clashes in which 13 Turkish soldiers have been killed in Syria in one week.
Relief agencies meanwhile said an exodus of hundreds of thousands of civilians from the afflicted areas was the largest such movement in nine years of war and a new humanitarian crisis was unfolding.
The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said government forces had seized the entire length of the M5 highway after driving rebels from their last foothold on the road. The M5 runs from Aleppo in the north to the capital Damascus then on to southern Deraa.
They took control of the highway after capturing a western suburb of Aleppo from insurgents.
The latest advances by President Bashar al-Assad's Russian and Iranian-backed troops came after 13 Turkish soldiers were killed in the Idlib region in the past week, prompting some of the most serious confrontations between Ankara and Damascus of the war.
Ankara deployed thousands of soldiers to stem the Syrian offensive.
Turkish-backed Syrian rebels downed a helicopter believed to belong to the Syrian government in the town of Nairab, Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber reported on Tuesday.
Since the new push began, government forces have recaptured more than 600 square km of territory and in recent days have taken control of dozens of towns and villages.
Last week they recaptured the crossroads town of Saraqeb, on the M5. Turkey has several military personnel stationed there to prevent further Syrian advances after eight of its soldiers were killed by Syrian shelling.
A Russian delegation arrived in Ankara on Saturday days after the attack to hold talks aimed at stopping clashes. On their final day of talks, a second Syrian attack on Turkish troops in the Taftanaz area killed five more troops.
Ankara has said that it retaliated to both attacks, destroying several Syrian targets. It said would drive back Assad's forces unless they withdraw by the end of the month. It also told the Russian team that attacks against Turkish posts must stop immediately.
The Russians left Turkey after talks ended on Monday, a Turkish diplomatic source said, with no apparent agreement.
The Kremlin said on Tuesday all attacks on Russian and Syrian forces in Idlib had to stop.
AIR RAIDS
Rescue teams in the region said Russian and Syrian war planes bombed several towns in Idlib, with most air raids on towns in western Aleppo, including a residential area in the city of Daraat Izza. At least 13 civilians were killed overnight in the air strikes, they said.
The rapid advances by Assad's forces in Idlib have driven nearly 700,000 people from their homes toward the closed-off Turkish border in the past 10 weeks. Most of those displaced are women and children.
""This is, from our initial analysis, the largest number of people in a single period since the Syrian crisis began almost nine years ago,"" Jens Laerke, spokesman for the United Nations' OCHA humanitarian agency, told reporters in Geneva. ""So it's the fastest growing displacement we have ever seen in the country.
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Andrej Mahecic said the harsh winter weather was making their suffering worse and shelter was hard to find.
""Even finding a place in an unfinished building is becoming nearly impossible,"" he said, adding that mosques were full.
Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, says it cannot absorb any more. It said it will halt new migrant waves from Idlib and its military will remain there.
One Turkish politician urged President Tayyip Erdogan to go further.
""There will be no peace in Turkey until Assad is brought down from his throne. Turkey must start plans to enter Damascus now, and annihilate the cruel ones,"" said Devlet Bahceli, chairman of Erdogan's nationalist partner party.
Witnesses and rebels said on Tuesday a new column of Turkish reinforcements, including tanks, rocket launchers and armored vehicles, crossed the border into Idlib overnight.
Turkish-backed Syrian rebels have also begun an new offensive against the government forces near army-controlled Saraqeb and Nairab to push troops away from Idlib city, where more than one million people live.
The battle for Idlib is a crucial stage of a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of combatants and civilians, made millions refugees in their own country or overseas, and fractured the wider Middle East since it broke out amid the Arab Spring in 2011.
Forces arrayed against Assad, Syria's ruler for nearly 20 years, have failed to dislodge him but he now presides over a devastated country. Moscow's military intervention in 2015 helped swing the war decisively in Assad's favor.
Despite being on opposing sides, Turkey and Russia collaborate for a political solution to the conflict."

STOCKTON, Calif. (Reuters) - William White, a 104-year-old U.S. Marine veteran who earned a Purple Heart in World War Two, is celebrating Valentine's Day this year like never before, surrounded by a mountain of 70,000 love letters and well-wishes sent from all over the world.
The cards and notes to ""Major Bill,"" a retired major who lives in an assisted living facility in Stockton, California, began pouring in after a fellow resident launched a social media campaign called ""Operation Valentine,"" asking friends and strangers alike to send greetings to honor White.
At the outset, the goal was a modest 100 cards - about one for every one of White's birthdays - but the response has outstripped all expectations.
""It's just too fantastic,"" said White, surrounded by waist-high stacks of postal boxes filled with cards.
On a recent day, White's great-granddaughter Abigail Sawyer, 9, delivered a bundle of cards from her fourth grade class, many of them decorated with the American flag.
A week before Valentine's Day, which lands on Friday this year, at least 70,000 pieces of correspondence had arrived from people in every U.S. state and several foreign countries.
So much mail has been delivered that White's family has had to enlist volunteers to help open the cards and read the warm wishes to White, who retired after 35 years of active service, including time in the Pacific theater of WWII, when he was wounded at Iwo Jima.
For those sending Valentines, White represents something bigger than himself. Many of them have conveyed a deep appreciation not only to White for his service, but to all veterans who died too soon to hear their gratitude.
A woman identified only as Jane told White that her late grandfather also fought in World War Two as a U.S. Army paratrooper. Had he lived, she said, he would be turning 100 years old this year.
""I miss him so much,"" she wrote. ""By sending you this card, I feel as though I am sending my grandfather a card.""
It's all new to White, who said he never really celebrated Valentine's Day, even when his wife of 42 years was alive.
""It's something I've never heard of or seen,"" White said. ""All of a sudden here, like a ton of bricks. I'm sort of speechless."""

MPs are set to vote on the government's policy statement which says ""painful steps"" are needed to address a financial crisis that has weakened the currency and pushed banks to severely curb access to deposits.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in central Beirut to try to block MPs from reaching the parliamentary building. Security forces blocked off all the roads leading to the barricaded parliament district. 
Men and women, their faces wrapped in scarves, lobbed rocks at security forces deployed at several locations around the city center as clouds of tear gas engulfed them. 
Protesters hurled eggs and threw paint at the cars of lawmakers and ministers while others tried to smash their tinted windows. 
Some MPs skirted the clashes, arriving at parliament on the back of motorcycles. Crowds chanted revolution, waved Lebanese flags and held signs that said ""no confidence"". 
One of the world's most heavily indebted states, Lebanon is facing a crisis rooted in decades of state waste and corruption which have fueled public anger.
The crisis came to a head last year as slowing flows of capital from abroad led to a hard currency crunch and protests erupted across the country against the ruling elite.
Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has said Lebanon should seek IMF technical help and take a decision on whether to pay maturing foreign debt next month based on IMF advice, an-Nahar newspaper and a government source said on Tuesday. 
Lebanon could not, however, surrender itself to the IMF because the nation could not bear its conditions, he said.
Senior MP Alain Aoun told Reuters on Tuesday the country needs IMF technical assistance and should draw on IMF advice in its decision on whether to pay a forthcoming Eurobond maturity. 
He said this was also expected to be the position of his political party, the FPM which was founded by President Michel Aoun and named six ministers.
Berri said Lebanon must take advantage of the time remaining before its next debt maturity on March 9 to send a message abroad, ""specifically to the Americans"" that the country needs IMF technical help through a rescue plan.
Berri is one of the country's most influential figures and his Amal Movement named a number of ministers in Diab's cabinet which took office last month, including the finance minister.
""There is still room for Lebanon during the coming two weeks and before the end of the current month to benefit from this measure,"" Berri was quoted as saying.
Based on this, ""Lebanon will be able to form its position on the maturing Eurobonds - whether to pay its commitments or not to pay them - based on what the IMF advises.""

But Berri also said the Lebanese people would be unable to bear IMF conditions, saying Lebanon was not Greece or Argentina - countries that have experienced their own financial crises.

""Iran's actions are based on international rules,"" Zarif said, according to the Khabaronline website.
Iran has rejected Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's call to send the ""black box"" flight recorders from the plane abroad to be decoded.
Many of the 176 who perished in the disaster were Iranians with dual citizenship, which is not recognized by Iran. Canada had 57 citizens on board.
Canadian lawyers, who previously successfully sued Iran, are seeking class action status in a lawsuit on behalf of victims aboard the plane, looking for at least C$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) in compensation."

State TV showed video footage of rallies in at least half a dozen cities outside the capital, including Mashhad, Ahvaz and Kerman, with people holding signs that read, “Death to America” and “Death to Israel”.
Iran almost got into a full-blown conflict with the United States last month after a U.S. drone strike killed top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Jan. 3, prompting Iran to retaliate with a missile barrage against a U.S. base in Iraq days later.
Tensions spiked between Iran and the United States after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran in 2018 and reimposed sanctions in a bid to pressure Tehran to negotiate over its ballistic missile program and ties with regional proxy groups.
Missiles were put on display as part of the anniversary celebrations, according to the Tasnim news agency. Iran’s state TV showed archival footage of missile launches and underground missile storage facilities as part of its anniversary coverage.
The missile program is not intended for attacks on neighboring countries, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Monday.

1204,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 05:01AM ET</span>","Bat meat still popular in parts of Indonesia, despite coronavirus fears","MANADO, Indonesia (Reuters) - Bat meat is still popular in some parts of Indonesia, despite research suggesting the coronavirus spreading from China might have originated in bats before being passed on to humans.
Bats are traditionally eaten by the Minahasan people from North Sulawesi in the form of a curry-like dish called Paniki. Whole bats are used in Paniki, including the head and wings.
""It (the coronavirus) has not affected sales,"" said bat seller Stenly Timbuleng at his stall in Tomohon, a city in North Sulawesi, south of the provincial capital of Manado.
""In fact... sales continue. It is always sold out.""
On an average day, Timbuleng sells 50-60 bats and during festive periods, he can sell up to 600.
""Bats are the favourite indigenous protein, particularly in North Sulawesi,"" Indonesian culinary expert and author of half a dozen of cookbooks, William W. Wongso, told Reuters.
""My favourite part is the wings,"" Wongso added.
Glands from the armpits and the neck of the bat are first removed to get rid of the bad smell.
It is then grilled or torched to get rid of the bat's hairs before being chopped and cooked in a stew of herbs, spices and coconut milk.
The coronavirus is believed to have originated in a food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species,
In China, the virus has killed more than 1,000 and infected more than 42,700.
There are 319 coronavirus cases in 24 countries and territories outside of China, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese health officials.
None has been reported in Indonesia, but the outbreak has prompted many Manadonese restaurants in the capital, Jakarta, to take bats off the menu.
For Manadonese Jufry Mantak, the links between the coronavirus and his favourite dish have not put him off.
""We have not found any (coronavirus) cases in Manado. Up till now, there are still many people eating these bats. Because bats are good, especially when cooked with coconut milk."""

BELFAST (Reuters) - Northern Irish police arrested four men on Tuesday as part of the investigation into the murder of journalist Lyra McKee, whose killing sparked outrage in the province where a 1998 peace deal mostly ended three decades of sectarian violence.
The men, aged 20, 27, 29 and 52, were arrested in Londonderry under the Terrorism Act over the shooting in April 2019 that was claimed by Irish nationalist militants opposed to the Good Friday peace deal.
The New IRA, one of a small number of groups that oppose the peace accord, said one of its members shot the 29-year-old reporter dead in Londonderry when they opened fire in the direction of police during a riot McKee was watching.
Her death was condemned at the time by both Irish Catholic nationalist and pro-British Protestant unionist politicians.
Then Prime Minister Theresa May described the attack as ""shocking and truly senseless"".
""I have always believed that some people within the community know what happened and who was involved,"" said Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy in a statement after Tuesday's arrests.
Murphy said he understood that people might be afraid to speak to the police but he promised people coming forward ""anonymity for the purpose of this investigation"", appealing for any mobile phone footage of the incident.
McKee, who was named Sky News Young Journalist of the Year in 2006, was writing a book on the disappearance of young people during the violence in Northern Ireland that largely ended with the 1998 deal.
She had also written about her struggles growing up gay in the British province.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 04:44AM ET</span>",Facebook's 'double-edged sword' in Thai carnage,"By Patpicha Tanakasempipat
NAKHON RATCHASIMA, Thailand (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) celebrity doctor Parkphum Dejhutsadin said his phone suddenly started pinging on Saturday - scores of his two million followers in Thailand were desperate and they needed his help.
With nowhere to turn as they cowered in a shopping mall from a rogue soldier who had already killed more than two dozen people, they looked to Facebook and other social media to send their pleas and to try to find escape.
Parkphum could help - and said for the next 16 hours that's all he did: living up to his panda-eyed Facebook persona as sleepless doctor ""Mor Lab Panda"".
""They told me where they were and sent me pictures of their hiding places. Authorities didn't know where anybody was hiding. But I knew everything,"" said Parkphum. ""I didn't sleep a wink. I didn't want them to die.""
While social media have been accused of exacerbating or even encouraging mass shootings such as last year's mosque massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, in Thailand they were also crucial to pulling off a safe and dramatic rescue from the shopping mall in Nakhon Ratchasima city.
Before 32-year-old killer Jakrapanth Thomma was cornered in a basement and shot dead, Thai commandos managed to coordinate raids into the mall to spring hundreds of people to safety.
""We were communicating on Facebook with the people inside to exchange information,"" Pongpipat Siripornwiwat, deputy commander of Nakhon Ratchasima police, told Reuters. ""Without it, our work would've been very difficult and we wouldn't have had any idea how many were trapped and what was going on inside.""
FACEBOOK LIFE
The tragedy underscored the extent to which Facebook is the communication platform for daily life in the country of 69 million which has about 56 million active users a month and where the average person spends three hours a day on social media. Most social media activity is on mobile phones.
And it was on Facebook that the killer, apparently angered by a property deal gone sour, first signaled his intentions.
""Do they think they can spend the money in hell?"" his post ended, roughly three hours before he opened fire at a house, then moved to an army camp, a temple and then the shopping mall - leaving a trail of murder behind him.
At one point he posted a selfie in front of a fire.
His last message before his Facebook account was shut down - ""Should I give up?"" - came nearly four hours after the first shot.
But after facing criticism for failing to take down the Christchurch shooter's livestream quickly and when a Thai father murdered his child on Facebook Live in 2017, the world's biggest social media company moved faster once it heard what was happening.
It shut his Facebook and Instagram accounts and then worked to remove anything that he had posted and was being shared by others - including by spoof accounts apparently set up in his name by other people after his own was blocked.
""There is no place on Facebook for people who commit this kind of atrocity, nor do we allow people to praise or support this attack,"" a Facebook representative said in a statement, adding that it worked closely with Thai authorities to take down content that violated its policies.
""We also responded to emergency requests from the Royal Thai Police to share information related to the shooter to prevent further harm,"" it said, without giving further details.
Twitter, where graphic videos of the incident were circulated, said it also took action - a company representative said it monitored its platform to remove video content of the attack and to shield graphic content from view.
But police said the shooter, who killed at least 29 people and wounded 57 before he was stopped, had not only used social media to publicize what he was doing but also to track police movements through online news sites.
""Social media was a double-edged sword. It helped police rescue people, but it also helped him keep up with our movements,"" said Pongpipat.
""PANDA EYES""
Parkphum, a medical technologist working for Thailand's National Blood Center, is so famous he even has his own set of stickers for social media messaging apps with his trademark ""panda eyes"" and white coat.
""Every message from the people about where they were hiding and how many were with them all turned out to be true when police got there. People were hiding in (fashion store) H&M, Eveandboy (a cosmetics shop), a gym. I now know the entire floor plan of the mall,"" he said.
Other Facebook celebrities with millions of followers also stepped in to coordinate and reassure.
""I told them to stay as quiet as possible and mute their phones, to send their locations and phone numbers,"" said Witawat Siriprachai, 36, known by Thais as the ""Sergeant"" of the social commentary page ""Drama-addict"".
""I warned them not to livestream from their locations, because the shooter was also using Facebook during the rampage,"" said Witawat, who is not a sergeant in real life.
At the shopping mall, 42-year-old Pat said she had just finished a meal when she heard the first shots and ran to hide in a mobile phone store. She said she was still traumatized and did not want to give her full name.
For five hours she said she scrolled through her Facebook newsfeeds to keep up with what was happening. Afraid to make the slightest noise she messaged friends who told her where to contact the police.
""I waited in complete darkness, and then the police replied to ask my exact location,"" she said.
Police worked with the information she gave to coordinate an escape route and timing for people on that floor - and when they gave clearance that the shooter was three floors down, everybody just sprinted to the fire exit.
At a crouching run, masked commandos led them to safety.
Just before 11 p.m., she posted to friends that she was safe."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Talks between Saudi Arabia and Qatar to resolve a bitter Gulf dispute broke down soon after starting, six sources said, leaving in place a political and trade embargo of Doha that hampers joint Gulf Arab efforts to counter Iran.
The discussions that began in October were the first glimmer of a thaw in the row that saw Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt sever political, trade and transport ties with Qatar in mid-2017.
The countries accused Qatar of supporting terrorism and cozying up to regional foe Iran. Doha denies the charges and says the embargo by its fellow Gulf Arabs aims to undermine its sovereignty.
Washington has strong ties with all the states involved, including Qatar which hosts the largest U.S. military base in the region, and sees the rift as a threat to efforts to contain Iran. It has pushed for a united Gulf front.
Qatar's priority in the discussions was to restore free movement for its citizens to the boycotting nations, access to the airspace of those countries and reopening Qatar's only land border shared with Saudi Arabia, four Western diplomats in the Gulf and two sources familiar with Qatari thinking said.
However, Riyadh wanted Qatar to first demonstrate a fundamental change in behavior, particularly in its foreign policy that has seen Doha back opposing sides in several regional conflicts, three of the diplomats said.
Qatar's government communications office and Saudi Arabia's media ministry did not reply to a Reuters' request for comment.
One diplomat said Saudi Arabia wanted a new arrangement with Qatar that would involve Doha making fresh commitments.
""That's a non-starter for Qatar as there are so many foreign policy disagreements,"" one of the diplomats said.
Two additional Gulf sources familiar with the talks said Saudi Arabia, which was representing the remaining boycotting states, ended the talks shortly after an annual Gulf summit in Riyadh in December that Qatar's emir did not attend.
The Qataris ""didn't seem serious"", one of the sources said.
Riyadh had wanted a foreign policy win ahead of hosting the summit of the Group of 20 major economies in 2020 after its reputation was tarnished by the 2018 killing of a prominent journalist by Saudi agents, three of the Western diplomats said.
A source familiar with Saudi thinking said Riyadh had been hopeful about the talks but things were now ""back to square one"".
The four boycotting states in 2017 presented Doha with a list of 13 demands, including closing Al Jazeera television network, shuttering a Turkish base, halting support for the Muslim Brotherhood and downgrading ties with Iran.
Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, who visited Saudi Arabia for talks, told Reuters on Dec. 14 there had been ""small progress"" without elaborating.
But a Qatari source familiar with government thinking told Reuters that discussions had ended because demands on Qatar were unrealistic, saying ""we weren't going to become a proxy state""."

Moi's coffin, draped in the Kenyan flag, was carried on a gun carriage from the State House, the official seat of the presidency, on the 5 km (3 mile) route to the stadium in the capital, Nairobi.
Troops from the Kenyan army, air force and the navy marched alongside into the stadium, where choirs were singing gospel songs as they awaited the cortege of the man described by critics as a virtual dictator.
""Moi was a humble man. Anybody who knew him, they know he was a humble man. President Moi never bragged in any success ... instead he attributed it to God,"" long-time friend Silas Yego, a retired bishop of the Africa Inland Church, where Moi had worshipped, told the mourners.
""Moi believed if you want to succeed, never tell a lie.""
Moi came to power in 1978 when he was serving as vice-president after the nation's first leader President Jomo Kenyatta died. He remained in power until the end of 2002.
He held power for longer than any other leader since independence and left a legacy of corruption that still haunts the East African nation.
During his rule, thousands of activists, students and academics were held without charge in the underground cells. Prisoners say they were sometimes denied food and water.
He succeeded in keeping Kenya relatively stable compared to many of its troubled neighbors.
But he floundered badly on the economy as poverty deepened and corruption flourished. A 2004 report by corporate investigations firm group Kroll accused Moi and his inner circle of stealing $2 billion of state funds - an accusation dismissed at the time by the government.
He won elections in 1992 and 1997 amid a divided opposition. But he was booed and heckled into retirement when term limits forced him to step down in 2002 and he lived quietly for years on his sprawling estate in the Rift Valley.
Several leaders from the region, including the Ethiopian President Sahle-Work Zewde, Rwanda's President Paul Kagame, South Sudan's Salva Kiir and Uganda's Yoweri Museveni joined President Uhuru Kenyatta and the other mourners at the service.
Moi's son Raymond gave the former president's eulogy and Kenyatta was also expected to address the crowd.
Tuesday was declared a public holiday."

Should the measure win a binding vote on May 17 in what is being called Switzerland's ""Brexit moment"", the country risks losing its privileged access to the EU single market that is the lifeblood of the export-led Swiss economy.
It could also end up kicking neutral Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, out of the Schengen system of passport-free travel and the Dublin accord on handling asylum requests, officials said in a statement ahead of a news conference.
""That would have painful consequences, primarily for security and asylum issues but also for border traffic and freedom to travel,"" the government said.
The referendum drive reflects unease with the influx of foreigners. Immigration contributed a net 55,000 people last year, when the foreign population stood at 2.1 million, or around a quarter of the overall 8.5 million.
Business leaders say they need skilled foreign workers, and imposing limits on EU citizens would violate the free-movement accord that enhances Swiss access to the single market.
A ""guillotine clause"" means ending free movement would scupper other pillars in a web of 120 custom-made bilateral pacts, including accords on the mutual recognition of industrial standards, public procurement, agriculture, research, and transport by land and air.
The eurosceptic People's Party -- the biggest in parliament and with two of the seven federal cabinet seats -- has long fought to take national control of immigration.
Its proposal under the Swiss system of direct democracy would allow a year to negotiate an end to free movement, but chances of this are practically nil given the EU's hard line on a key policy tenet.
Battling the referendum campaign is a priority for the Swiss government, which has struggled to put relations with the surrounding EU on a new footing.
Brussels wants the Swiss to endorse a new treaty that would have Bern routinely adopt single market rules and create a more effective platform to resolve disputes.
The Swiss government has dragged its feet for months while trying to forge consensus on how to proceed, annoying Brussels and triggering a row over cross-border stock trading.
The treaty ran aground amid opposition that spanned the normally pro-Europe center left to the anti-EU far right. Critics say the pact infringes Swiss sovereignty to the extent that it would never get through parliament or pass a referendum."

The tabloid said Phillips, the eldest of the British monarch's eight grandchildren, was devastated that his wife Autumn wanted to split up.
The couple, who married in 2008, have two children, Savannah, 9, and Isla, 7. Buckingham Palace said it had no comment as it was a private matter.
Phillips, 42, son of Elizabeth's daughter Princess Anne and 15th-in-line to the throne, and Autumn, 41, met in 2003 at the Montreal Grand Prix, when he worked for the Formula 1 racing team BMW Williams (NYSE:WMB) and she worked at the BMW hospitality suite.
They married at the queen’s Windsor Castle residence near London, the scene for a number of recent royal weddings including that of another of Elizabeth's grandsons, Prince Harry to his American wife Meghan.
Phillips has no royal title and has tended to stay out of the limelight. He did, however, organize a giant street party in front of Buckingham Palace to celebrate the queen's 90th birthday in 2016.
The Sun said the monarch, 93, would be very upset by the news which comes on the back on a series of major setbacks for the royal family.
Harry and Meghan plunged the Windsors into crisis last month when they announced they wanted to cut back on official duties. That led to a deal which means they will retire as working royals to spend more time in Canada and the United States.
Meanwhile, the queen's second son Prince Andrew also stepped down from public duties in November over his connections to sex scandals involving late U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein.
""The queen must wonder what she has done to deserve this,"" the Sun quoted an unnamed senior royal source as saying.
""Peter Phillips has always been a favorite of hers and Prince Philip and she will be crestfallen by this, especially on top of all the other bad news. It makes you wonder what’s going to happen next."""

""This was a deliberate and sweeping intrusion into the private information of the American people,"" Barr said in announcing the indictments of four members of the Chinese Liberation Army in connection with one of the largest data breaches in U.S. history.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang denied the allegations on Tuesday and said China's government, military and their personnel ""never engage in cyber theft of trade secrets.""
The announcement is the latest in an aggressive campaign by American authorities to root out Chinese espionage operations in the United States. Since turning the spotlight on China in 2018, the United States has snared a growing group of Chinese government officials, business people, and academics pursuing American secrets.
Roughly 147 million people had information, including Social Security numbers, birth dates and driver's license data, compromised by the Equifax breach.
The hackers spent weeks in the Equifax system, breaking into computer networks, stealing company secrets and personal data. The hackers routed traffic through approximately 34 servers located in nearly 20 countries to obfuscate their true location.
Equifax Chief Executive Mark Begor said the company was grateful for the Justice Department investigation.
""It is reassuring that our federal law enforcement agencies treat cybercrime – especially state-sponsored crime – with the seriousness it deserves,"" he said in a statement.
U.S. officials have said Chinese hackers were behind a massive breach at the Office of Personnel Management, which came to light in 2015 and involved the compromise of sensitive personal data submitted by applicants for U.S. government security clearances.
That breach exposed the names, Social Security numbers and addresses of more than 22 million current and former U.S. federal employees and contractors, as well as 5.6 million fingerprints.
Chinese hackers are similarly suspected of being behind a massive breach at hotel group Marriott International Inc.
The Equifax hack fits into a pattern of past Chinese cyberattacks, said Michael Daniel, a former White House cybersecurity coordinator, because the stolen data can support other spying efforts. 
""Its primary utility would be in developing potential targets for approach by intelligence operatives or feeding artificial intelligence [and] machine learning tools,"" said Daniel, who currently serves as president of the Cyber Threat Alliance, a cybersecurity information sharing group.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng, when asked about the indictments, said on Tuesday that Beijing is also a victim of U.S. ""cyber intrusion, surveillance and monitoring activities.""
""We have lodged stern representations to the US and asked it to make explanations and immediately stop such activities,"" he said.
Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, urged tougher action to counter Chinese hacking.
""The Chinese Communist Party will leave no stone unturned in its effort to steal and exploit American data. These indictments are good news, but we've got to do more to protect Americans' data from Chinese Communist Party influence operations,"" he said in a statement.
The Equifax data breach, because it was so large and involved so much sensitive financial information on so many Americans, had far-reaching implications for Equifax and the consumer credit industry.
The company agreed to pay up to $700 million to settle claims it broke the law during the data breach and to repay harmed consumers.
The scandal sent the company into turmoil, leading to the exit of its then-CEO, Richard Smith, and multiple congressional hearings as the company's slowness to disclose the breach and security practices were challenged by lawmakers. 

Policymakers and consumer groups have questioned how private companies could amass so much personal data, sparking efforts to bolster consumers' ability to control their information. Both the Senate Banking and House of Representatives Financial Services Committees are considering legislation that would require companies to better protect consumer data.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's ruling party was projected to lose a key state election on Tuesday, the vote count showed, in its first electoral test since deadly anti-government protests erupted nearly two months ago.
The Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi won a bigger majority in a general election in May, but it has lost a string of state elections since then.
The protests, in which at least 25 people have been killed, erupted across the country in mid-December, after the BJP passed a new citizenship law critics say violates India's secular constitution and discriminates against minority Muslims.
In counting for state polls held in India's capital New Delhi, data from India's Election Commission showed the liberal Aam Aadmi Party, led by the city’s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, leading 57 out of 70 seats.
The BJP ran a campaign accusing protesters of supporting India's arch-rival Pakistan and was projected to win 13 seats, up from three in 2015 but far below its own expectations. The party's local chief Manoj Tiwari had predicted it would win a majority.
AAP activists in distinctive white boat-shaped caps danced outside party headquarters in New Delhi as the result became clear, TV channels showed.
Neelanjan Sircar, an assistant professor at Ashoka University near New Delhi, said that local issues, including delivery of basic services like education and health, appeared to sway voters toward the AAP, even as the BJP ran a polarizing campaign on the back of Modi's image.
""Modi is a larger than life character at the national level, which obviously gives the BJP a huge advantage in national politics,"" Sircar said.
""But it doesn't translate to state level politics, where the BJP often doesn't have a charismatic face.""
Bespectacled former bureaucrat Kejriwal, 51, formed AAP in 2012 amid an anti-corruption movement that swept India.
The party won a stunning victory in 2015 state elections in the capital, wiping out the BJP and Congress, the party that has ruled India for half its post-independence history.
The Congress - the main opposition at national level - was projected to win no seats in Delhi on Tuesday, data showed, reflecting the deep decline in its fortunes."

BUCHAN, Australia (Reuters) - Returning from a morning feeding his sheep, Jeff McCole, a 70-year-old farmer, paused to take in the bittersweet scene – a few droplets of rain falling onto the remains of his fire-ravaged home.
""Nothing like the sound of rain on a tin roof,"" he said, as he scanned the residue of a lifetime of memories scattered before him.
By the old front door was a charred metal toy truck his grandchildren once raced down the verandah. Under the remains of the tin roof, a collection of books, his wife's ""pride and joy"", had been reduced to layers of feathery ash. And out back, the skeleton of a Valencia orange tree, planted by his mother 65 years ago, was now laden with baubles of charcoaled fruit.
Seasonal bushfires have struck Australia in a way like never before, making for months of monster blazes and toxic haze, and fuelling a polarizing debate over climate change.
But in Buchan, a conservative-voting farming town in Victoria state that is home to the McCole farm, most locals said they believed the catastrophic fires had nothing to do with global warming.
Climate change was ""a load of crap"", said McCole, an idea pushed by city folk with ""no experience in the bush"" and no understanding of Australia's punishing, cyclical climate.
""We've had severe droughts and everything like that, 70 years ago,"" said McCole, a Vietnam war veteran with sky-blue eyes. ""It just keeps going around in circles. If you wait, it's going to change.""
RISING RISKS
For decades scientists have warned that climate change would increase the risk of extreme bushfires in Australia. This year, there was the perfect storm – record-breaking drought and heat coalescing on tinderbox land.
Before rains slowed their spread in recent days, the fires had burned through almost 12 million hectares, destroyed more than 2,800 homes, and claimed the lives of 33 people. An estimated one billion native animals are also believed to have died.
Australia has one of the world's highest carbon footprints per capita and is one of the largest exporters of coal and gas, making successive governments reluctant to adopt climate change policies they say could undermine the economy.
But with these unprecedented bushfires, the government has come under increased pressure from environmental groups, scientists and broader swathes of the Australian public to address the climate change issue.
""People are more fearful of the future because they glimpsed the future this summer,"" said Lesley Hughes, a professor and climate scientist at Macquarie University. ""I think it has been really wounding of the Australian psyche.""
Polling by the Australia Institute, a Canberra think tank, in January found that 79% of Australians said they were concerned about climate change, up five percentage points from last July, with 47% ""very concerned"", a jump of 10 points.
But there remains widespread scepticism that the severity of the fires is due to climate change, with many conservative politicians and media suggesting that factors such as arson, the length of cyclical droughts or poor management of flammable vegetation are more responsible.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who had previously declined to discuss the link between climate change and the fires, recently acknowledged the connection, but said his priority was managing the economic impact.
Morrison last week cited ""hazard reduction"" – which includes the practice of controlled burns to reduce the amount of flammable vegetation in the bush, as a key to mitigating fires in the future, saying it was just as important as reducing emissions.
Climate scientists say that the bigger problem for Australia are longer droughts and increasingly hot summers.
The issue of controlled burns is a deeply emotional one in Buchan, where at least 20 homes were lost in the fires that struck in December.
""Climate change or not,"" said Donald Graham, a farmer who survived the fires huddled in his concrete bunker with a stack of cheese and vegemite sandwiches. ""These fires were a disaster waiting to happen.""
A DEATH TRAP
The road from Melbourne to Buchan winds past a series of small country towns, pie shops and historic churches and, after a weekend of rain, verdant green fields with dairy cows.
But closer to Buchan, population 385, the road is eerily burnt out, lined by rows of black tree trunks sticking out of ashy ground.
When the bushfires hit the town on Dec. 30, they roared in on three fronts with a ferocity that no locals had ever seen.
For more than a month, fires had raged ominously in nearby bushland, finally bellowing in with ""one heck of a red glow"", McCole said.
From the verandah of his home, nestled on a 400-hectare property of rolling hills, gum trees and Merino sheep, he watched a giant orange plume crest over the hill and rain down fiery embers.
""We only had ten minutes to get out and I think that was the best call I ever made,"" he said with a wry laugh. ""It was a death trap.""
The town of Buchan is a single main street with a general store and a pub - the kind of place where locals have time to discuss the pressing issues of the day with a stranger.
""The issue of climate change and the fire is a dead duck as far as I'm concerned,"" said Graham, an animated 68-year-old cattleman with a shock of gray hair. ""What is the most significant thing, is the changing structure of the forest.""
Minutes before he watched his house go up in flames from the peephole of his bunker, Graham raced inside to grab a picture from the wall, a colonial lithograph featuring the magnificent valley below overlooking the confluence of the Snowy and Buchan rivers.
The picture is significant because it shows how much the land has changed, he said.
""We've got an accumulation of vegetation. Our area was burned 50-70 years ago and it has not burned since, and at some point it will burn,"" he said. ""It just needs a few things to come together, a few dry years and some lightning and neither of those are peculiar to the Australian landscape.""
His neighbor John Coates, a 76-year-old cattle farmer, said that decades of vegetation growth had turned the land into a ""timebomb"".
Walking through their property overlooking the Snowy River National Park, Coates and his wife Janice shook their heads at the destruction – bald, blackened hills and the devastated gorge below, once filled with ferns, lyrebirds and platypus in the creek.
Many locals in Buchan recall the days they would carry a box of matches in their pockets so they could carry out their own hazard-reduction burns.
But regulations subsequently put in place aimed at protecting state forests and bushland mean they are now dependent on government agencies for carrying out controlled burns.
For years, local farmers had urged the government to carry out burns to reduce the ""fuel load"", or the accumulation of trees, underbrush and dry grass that can turn a small bushfire into an inferno, Coates said. But it never happened.
Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer for Forest Fire Management Victoria, said in a statement to Reuters that his agency had planned to burn 246,396 hectares of the state's public land last year, but was ""unable to do so because it would have been unsafe"".
Scientists also say the drought and increasingly hot weather means there are fewer days that vegetation can be safely burned.
Commenting on the issue in New South Wales, Richie Merzian, climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, said it was not a case of failing to implement techniques that had worked in the past, but that such techniques were ""insufficient to address the scenario now"".
""You can't blame the dry conditions and say it has no relevance to climate change,"" he said. ""It's a combination of many different climatic changes that can be linked back to the overall trend.""
SEASONS 'OUT OF SYNC'
In Buchan, not everyone in town was averse to talk of climate change – a few spoke of the seasons being ""out of sync"", the lack of rain or the demise of fragrant yellow box flowers in the valley.
But the fires have mainly reinforced pre-existing views and gripes, reflecting the polarizing rhetoric of the national climate change debate.
Last November, Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack – who heads the party that won in the electorate that includes Buchan – described climate change concerns as those held by ""inner-city raving lunatics"".
That messaging appeared to resonate in Buchan, far from the skyscrapers and the lights of Melbourne or Sydney, with a strong sense that people here were living far greener lives.
""They blame our cows,"" said McCole, referring to recent attention on the earth-warming methane produced by belching or flatulent cattle. But, he said, ""they are all jumping on electric trains and cars and god knows what in the city and there are millions of them, flying around the world in jumbo jets.""
""It takes a good cow to put out that many emissions,"" he said. ""I can tell ya."""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's army chief apologized on Tuesday for a rogue soldier, whose 19-hour shooting rampage killed 29 people and wounded 57 over the weekend, stunning the country.
At times wiping away tears, Thai Army Chief General Apirat Kongsompong said during a 90-minute press conference that the army will help compensate all the victims and their families.
""I, as army chief, would like to apologize and say how sorry I am for this incident which was caused by a staff of the army,"" Apirat said.
""In the minute, the second that the perpetrator pulled the trigger and killed, in that minute he is a criminal and no longer a soldier,"" he said.
The soldier, Sergeant Major Jakrapanth Thomma, was shot dead by security forces on Sunday after he had stormed the Terminal 21 shopping center in the northeastern city of Nakhon Ratchasima the day before.
The 32-year-old had started the killing early on Saturday, shooting his commanding officer and the commander's mother-in-law over a business dispute.
He then drove to his army base, stole more assault weapons and ammunition and shot his way through a Buddhist temple before going to the Terminal 21 shopping center, where he randomly fired at shoppers and held off police for more than 12 hours.
Apirat said the military would investigate the commanding officer who was killed, Colonel Anantharot Krasae, 48, and the housing deal apparently brokered by Anantharot's mother-in-law Anong Mitchan, 63.
Apirat said the commanding officer took advantage of the shooter in a land deal where a ""promise was broken"" over money matters.
He said authorities will find out who else was involved in the scheme and he promised a new line of communication so that army personnel could complain directly to the army chief.
""The army and I have already instructed this,"" he said, adding his mission before retirement in October was to make things fairer for army staff.
""I don’t think any Thai people would like this incident to happen again, so please don't blame the army or berate soldiers,"" Apirat said.
""If you want to blame someone, you blame General Apirat Kongsompong. I accept all criticisms and opinions. You can blame me because I am the army chief,"" he said."

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The African Union has agreed not to start financing security operations from a new fund until 2023 because it has received fewer contributions than hoped.
The AU, which groups 55 African countries, had hoped to start tapping the fund this year for peacekeeping missions, mediation and conflict prevention on a continent facing severe threats of violence and terrorism.
But at the end of a summit in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, it decided not to start using the fund yet after it emerged it had less than half of the $400 million it had targeted.
The failure to secure as much funding as planned is a new setback to security hopes in Africa following an increase in attacks by Islamist militants in the vast Sahel region of western and north-central Africa.
It also follows a drawdown of AU peacekeepers in Somalia as external donors reduce funding, aiming to transfer responsibility to Somali forces.
AU nations have so far raised only $164 million, said Donald Kaberuka, the AU's special envoy for the fund.
Fewer than 30 member states have paid their full contributions and five have never paid their annual dues, according to an internal document seen by Reuters.
North African states, including Egypt and Algeria, are challenging their yearly contributions and want Central African states such as Cameroon and Central African Republic to pay more, five AU officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Kaberuka said the decision on how much each country would pay had been postponed until later this year.
""Most countries do agree about the financing mechanism,"" he said, adding that ""for those who disagree we have until July 2020 to find a solution.""
FURTHER DELAYS AHEAD?
Prolonged disagreements on how much each member state provides could cause further delays for the fund in the future.
""The AU is trying to be more self-sufficient, less reliant on donors,"" said Elissa Jobson, Director of Africa Regional Advocacy for the International Crisis Group think tank. ""This delays that process.""
But a senior AU official told reporters the huge threat posed to Africa by violence and terrorism, and governments' inadequate resources to tackle them, means more international support is needed.
""We still need first for the United Nations Security Council to take its responsibilities and the rest of the international community not to let down Africa,"" said Smail Chergui, commissioner of the AU's Peace and Security Council.
He said poor nations in the Sahel such as Chad and Niger were cutting spending on health and education to ramp up security efforts and said this was ""morally unacceptable""."
1221,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 11:41PM ET</span>",Hopes crisis is nearly over as rains forecast to douse more Australia wildfires,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Torrential rain across Australia's east could extinguish all remaining bushfires in the country's most populous state by the end of the week, authorities said on Tuesday, raising hopes a deadly national crisis is almost over.
Australia has been battling hundreds of blazes since September in an unusually prolonged summer wildfire season that was fueled by three years of drought, which experts have attributed to climate change.
Heavy rain and storms have in recent days swept across New South Wales (NSW) state, which bore the brunt of a crisis that engulfed several states and territories at its peak.
The downpour has already doused two of the biggest and longest running blazes and NSW officials are hopeful that more rain forecast for this week will extinguish the remaining 24 fires, four of which are burning ""uncontrolled"".
""All going well, all will be contained and we're hopeful to get to a stage where we can call them out,"" the NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) said in an emailed statement.
The current situation is a far cry from the height of the crisis in early January when NSW firefighters were battling almost 150 fires that produced a firefront about 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles) long.
Blazes across the country have razed nearly 12 million hectares (29.7 million acres) of tinder-dry bushland, killing 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals, since September. The fires destroyed thousands of homes and prompted mass evacuations of both locals and tourists under apocalyptic-like red skies during Australia's peak summer holiday period.
Hawkesbury City Mayor Barry Calvert said the dousing of the massive Gospers Mountain fire this week was a huge relief.
""We've been living with this fire for four months,"" he told Reuters by telephone. ""We could never relax. For several weeks, we all had our bags packed ready to evacuate as the fire would move quickly in different directions depending on how the wind changed.""
""The smoke would also get you down, we were desperate for some clean air.""
WELCOME SURPRISE
The welcome rainfall has come as something of an early surprise. The Bureau of Meteorology in January said rains sufficient enough to extinguish the fires was unlikely until at least March.
In neighboring Victoria state, firefighters were battling around 20 blazes on Tuesday - down from a peak of 60. Heavy rain was also forecast in Victoria for coming days, although officials expect it to dampen, rather than extinguish, many of the fires.
""The lower end rainfall totals won't put out fires, they will allow them to be contained or controlled by firefighters in the near future,"" Victorian State Response Controller Tim Wiebusch told reporters in Melbourne.
In Queensland state, which also received heavy rainfalls, just one fire remains ablaze, while nine fires are alight in South Australia south.
The rainfall has, however, proved to be a double-edged sword. Nearly 60,000 households across NSW remained without electricity on Tuesday as flash flooding bought down powerlines and trees."

Tensions have spiked between China and the island since Sunday, when Taiwan F-16s shadowed Chinese fighters and bombers which flew around the island. Beijing claims Taiwan as its territory, to be taken by force if needed. 
On Monday, Taiwan's air force scrambled after Chinese jets briefly crossed an unofficial middle line in the Taiwan Strait, which both sides' forces generally stay on their respective sides of.
In a statement late on Monday, the People's Liberation Army Eastern Theatre Command said its forces carried out ""air-ground assault and fire support drills to further refine and test their multi-service joint combat capabilities"".
China has stepped up such drills since Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen first took office in 2016, believing she wishes to push for the island's formal independence, a red line for China.
Tsai, who won re-election by a landslide last month on a platform of standing up to China, says Taiwan is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
China's Eastern Theatre Command said that ""Taiwan independence forces have ignored national justice and stepped up their pursuit of independence"".
""The theater forces always maintain a high degree of alertness, follow closely the situation and resolutely fulfill their missions,"" the statement added.
Taiwan has denounced the drills as a threat to regional peace, and says the island will not buckle in the face of China's threats.
Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters on Tuesday that China's military actions had ""unnecessary triggered resentment among Taiwanese and harassed regional peace.""
""We still hope China could really alleviate people's suffering due to the disease outbreak,"" Su said. ""China should use all the power it has to help its people.""

Tsai said on Monday that China should focus on tackling the outbreak of the new coronavirus rather than menacing the island.

The company has told the ministry that potentially stolen data included requirements for defense equipment that the ministry specified for contract bidders in October 2018, the ministry said in a statement.
The ministry said it was still in the process of investigating the security impact of the potential leak. Mitsubishi Electric did not win the contract in the auction.
Mitsubishi Electric initially denied the possibility of a breach of sensitive defense and infrastructure data when it first reported on the 200-megabyte cyberattacks by a third party on Jan. 20.
But subsequent checks at the company revealed that the defense ministry's information that required special care was included in data potentially stolen by the attacks, Mitsubishi Electric said in a separate statement on Monday.
The company has said it first discovered the cyberattacks in June last year, more than half a year before it disclosed them to the public."

Vanessa Bryant, 37, has made few public appearances since the crash that killed her husband, daughter and seven others and said in the social media post that she had been ""reluctant"" to put her feelings into words.
""My brain refuses to accept that both Kobe and Gigi are gone,"" she said, using a nickname for her daughter. ""I can't process both at the same time. It's like I'm trying to process Kobe being gone but my body refuses to accept my Gigi will never come back to me.""
Bryant said she felt anger at losing both her husband and daughter and has to remind herself to be strong for the couple's three surviving daughters.
""God I wish they were here and this nightmare would be over,"" she said. ""Praying for all of the victims of this horrible tragedy. Please continue to pray for all.""
The death of Bryant, an 18-time all-star in the National Basketball Association and one of the world's most admired sports figures, prompted an outpouring of shock and grief from fans and fellow athletes around the globe.
The retired Los Angeles Lakers forward had been on his way to a youth basketball tournament in which he was coaching and his daughter and two other girls aboard the luxury chopper were due to compete.
Federal investigators have not yet determined a cause for the crash in Calabasas, California, outside Los Angeles, but have said the helicopter was flying in dense fog and that there was no evidence of engine failure."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has scaled back a planned judicial reform that alarmed rights defenders and caused a backlash within President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's cabinet, three officials told Reuters, adding that the revised version could be unveiled within days.
It was not immediately clear if the new proposal will still include new rules on wire taps that would allow private communications to be used as evidence and limits to legal challenges that can lead to extradition delays, issues seen as vital to Mexico's security partner, the United States.
Challenges have been used to draw out the legal process for several drug traffickers, including that of Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzman, who is currently serving a life sentence in the United States.
The sources said the new version was considerably less ambitious than a draft reported by Reuters in January. The drafts, which included sweeping changes to Mexico's criminal law, led to an outcry among rights groups and a rethink.
The new version of the reform ""is not very deep"" and does not go as far as the original plan, said one of the sources, a senior government official who requested anonymity in order to speak more frankly.
The proposed reform, led by Mexico's Attorney General Alejandro Gertz, is the cornerstone of Mexico's attempts to reform its unwieldy judicial system after a previous overhaul in 2016 failed to end low conviction rates and record murder numbers.
The original proposals included an expanded use of preventive detention and in some case could have validated illegally obtained evidence. Some ministers and members of the ruling party felt such ideas infringed human rights, half a dozen sources consulted by Reuters said.
""I don't agree what the attorney general is doing,"" said one of the sources. ""He brings his own reforms.""
The attorney general's office did not respond to a request for comment. In a previous statement, the office distanced itself from the drafts and said Gertz had not signed off on them.
The bill were to be submitted to Congress in mid-January.
Lopez Obrador took office in 2018 with the promise of fighting corruption and violence fueled by organized crime. But last year, murders hit a new record with 34,582 cases, raising criticism of his security strategy.
The administration proposed the reform in response to the failure of a criminal justice system in place since 2016 that many security forces and politicians complain has made it harder for them to prosecute suspects, driving crime higher, they say.
Less than 10% of homicides in Mexico are resolved and traditionally many confessions are achieved under torture or pressure from authorities."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's highest court on Tuesday ruled two Indigenous men cannot be deported even though they were born overseas and never applied for citizenship, in a landmark ruling for the country's first inhabitants.
Australia's conservative government has in recent months moved to deport hundreds of foreigners convicted of crimes as part of an immigration crack-down that can also strip dual-nationals of their Australian citizenship.
The move has seen scores of people deported from Australia, sometimes to countries they had left when just children.
Daniel Love and Brendan Thoms were born overseas with at least one of their parents an Indigenous Australian citizen.
Both men had been living in Australia with permanent residency visas but had never applied to become citizens.
Their visas were revoked after they were separately convicted in 2018 of crimes that carried prison sentences of more than a year.
Australia's conservative government had sought to treat the men as foreigners and deport them to Papua New Guinea and New Zealand.
But in a 4-3 ruling, Australia's High Court said the men must be treated like citizens and can therefore remain. Love still faces another hearing to determine his Indigenous heritage.
""This is significant for Aboriginal Australians. This case is not about citizenship. It's about who belongs here, who is an Australian national and who is a part of the Australian community,"" Claire Gibbs, a lawyer for the two men, told reporters in Canberra.
Gibbs called on Australia to release Thoms who has been held in a detention center for more than a year awaiting deportation.
The country's 700,000 or so Indigenous people track near the bottom of its 25 million citizens in almost every economic and social indicator."

BELFAST (Reuters) - Northern Ireland's first same-sex wedding is scheduled to take place on Tuesday after the government lifted a ban on gay marriage in the province, marking legalization of the practice throughout the United Kingdom.
The Love Equality campaign group said in a statement that Belfast couple Robyn Peoples, 26, a healthcare worker from the city, and Sharni Edwards, 27, a waitress originally from Brighton, would be the province's first gay couple to wed.
The women are set to exchange vows in Carrickfergus, County Antrim on Tuesday, their sixth anniversary as a couple.
""We didn't set out to make history. We just fell in love,"" Edwards said in the Love Equality statement.
""We feel humbled that our wedding is a landmark moment for equal rights in Northern Ireland.""
The couple had been planning a civil partnership - legal across the UK since 2005 - but decided to get married instead after the landmark change came into law on Monday.
Northern Ireland's prohibition on same-sex marriage was eliminated by the central government after a vote by British lawmakers when the province did not have a sitting government.
The socially conservative Democratic Unionist Party had previously been able to block same-sex civil marriage rights. The provincial assembly began sitting again last month.
The British parliament also voted to loosen restrictions on abortion in the region at the same time.
Britain's Northern Ireland Minister Julian Smith, members of parliament and campaigners will celebrate the legalization of gay marriage at an event in London.
Sara Canning, the partner of murdered author Lyra McKee, who was shot dead by a New IRA gunman in Londonderry last year, will also attend the London event.
""Our message to the world on our wedding day is: We are equal,"" Peoples said ""Our love is personal, but the law which said we couldn't marry was political. We are delighted that, with our wedding, we can now say that those days are over."""
1228,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 06:59PM ET</span>",El Salvador president's power play stokes democracy concerns,"By Nelson Renteria
SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - President Nayib Bukele's use of armed soldiers in El Salvador's parliament over the weekend has alarmed political foes and rights groups, with growing fears about democratic backsliding in the crime-ravaged Central American nation.
Bukele, 38, on Sunday showed up in the National Assembly with a group of uniformed soldiers wielding automatic weapons for a special session he convened, amid attempts to pressure parliamentarians to pass his crime-fighting plan. He also warned lawmakers that the people have a right to ""insurrection.""
The show of force inside the country's parliament drew condemnation from across the political spectrum and some foreign nations, amid worries El Salvador's young democracy may be harmed by presidential overreach.
Concerns that Bukele is using troops to intimidate lawmakers comes at a time when leaders of several nations in Latin America, where military rule was common in the 1970s and 80s, are leaning on armed forces to give them a helping hand in domestic politics.
""The Salvadoran military should not be used to resolve disputes between the president and congress. Civilian differences should be resolved by civilian institutions,"" said Eliot Engel, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee.
""The eyes of the world are on El Salvador and @nayibbukele at this critical moment,"" he added, in a post on the committee's Twitter account.
Both of El Salvador's traditional parties, the right-wing ARENA and leftist FMLN, founded by former guerrillas, accused Bukele of attempting a type of ""coup"" against other branches of government.
Oscar Ortiz, secretary general of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) party, said Bukele's actions marked ""the blackest day"" for the country's democracy.
The youthful president, who identified as a leftist at the start of his political career with the FMLN before changing parties, has sky-high popularity ratings after overturning the moribund two-party system in an election last year.
But he lacks a majority in parliament. Bukele's right-wing Great National Alliance (GANA) party and allies control only 11 of the 84 seats in the National Assembly. Arena has 37 lawmakers. 
The former one-term mayor of the capital, San Salvador, replied to critics of his move on Monday, saying it was evidence of a corrupt system protecting itself. 
Bukele wants lawmakers to agree to a $109 million loan to help equip police and soldiers in the fight against crime in a nation racked by gang violence. He gave them a week-long deadline to pass the loan legislation, without specifying what action he would take if they failed to meet his demands.
El Salvador's murder rate has plunged since Bukele took office in July but remains high. 
Warnings about a democratic reversal have deep resonance in El Salvador, where about 75,000 were killed and 8,000 disappeared during a 12-year civil war between the military and FMLN, which became a political party at the end of the war in 1992.
On Sunday, the United Nations called for dialogue, while Costa Rica said it trusted the constitution would be respected in light of the events in parliament.
Bukele has been a strong U.S. ally on issues such as immigration and a critic of ""anti-democratic"" regional governments, especially in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Honduras.
Marvin Ponce, adviser to Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, said Bukele's poll ratings had gone to his head and he was acting like a ""dictator"" who was ""unhinged"" by power.
""It's a bad example for democracies in Latin America,"" Ponce told Reuters.

1229,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 06:27PM ET</span>","Exclusive: North Korea enhanced nuclear, missile programs in 2019 in breach of sanctions - U.N. report","By Michelle Nichols
(Reuters) - North Korea continued to enhance its nuclear and ballistic missile programs last year in breach of United Nations sanctions, according to a confidential U.N. report seen by Reuters on Monday.
The country also illicitly imported refined petroleum and exported some $370 million worth of coal with the help of Chinese barges, the report added.
The 67-page report to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee, which is due to be made public next month, comes as the United States tries to revive stalled denuclearization talks with North Korea.
""In 2019, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) did not halt its illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs, which it continued to enhance, in violation of Security Council resolutions,"" the independent U.N. sanctions monitors wrote.
""Despite its extensive indigenous capability it uses illicit external procurement for some components and technology.""
North Korea has been subjected to U.N. sanctions since 2006. They have been strengthened by the 15-member Security Council over the years in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
SHIP-TO-SHIP TRANSFERS
The sanctions monitors said that in a fresh bid to evade sanctions, North Korea had started to export millions of tonnes of commodities - banned since 2017 - using barges.
""According to a Member State, the DPRK exported 3.7 million metric tons of coal between January and August 2019, with an estimated value of $370 million,"" the report said.
""According to the Member State, most DPRK coal exports, an estimated 2.8 million metric tons, were conducted via ship-to-ship transfers from DPRK-flagged vessels to Chinese local barges.""
The unidentified member state told the monitors that barges had delivered coal directly to three ports in China's Hangzhou Bay and also to facilities along the Yangtze river.
The U.N. monitors also said a member state reported that North Korea had exported at least one million tonnes of sand from river dredging, worth at least $22 million, to Chinese ports.
Pyongyang ally China has repeatedly said it is implementing U.N. sanctions.
In a statement, China’s mission to the United Nations described any accusations against China as “baseless.”
“On the implementation of the Security Council resolutions concerning the DPRK, China has always faithfully and seriously fulfilled its international obligations and sustained huge losses and tremendous pressure in the process,” a spokesperson for China’s U.N. mission said. 
The sanctions monitors reported that North Korea continued to illicitly import refined petroleum through ship-to-ship transfers at sea and direct deliveries.
Since 2017, North Korea's annual imports of refined petroleum have been capped by the U.N. Security Council at 500,000 barrels. The monitors said the United States reported that between Jan. 1 and Oct. 31 last year, Pyongyang imported refined petroleum that exceeded the cap ""many times over.""
'UNINTENDED EFFECTS'
While U.N. sanctions are not meant to harm North Korean civilians, the U.N. report said: ""There can be little doubt that U.N. sanctions have had unintended effects on the humanitarian situation and aid operations, although access to data and evidence is limited and there is no reliable methodology that disambiguates UN sanctions from other factors.""
Russia and China have raised concerns that sanctions were harming North Korean civilians, and have expressed hope that easing some restrictions could help break the deadlock in nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang.
But the United States, France and Britain said now is not the time to consider lifting sanctions.
North Korea has said it is no longer bound by a commitment to halt nuclear and missile testing, blaming the United States for failing to meet an end-2019 deadline to show more flexibility in nuclear talks and in ""brutal and inhumane"" sanctions.
The U.N. report said North Korea conducted 13 missile tests last year, launching at least 25 missiles, including new types of short range and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
""It continued to develop infrastructure and capacity for its missile program,"" the monitors said.
The sanctions monitors also concluded that North Korea continued to carry out cyber attacks against financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges globally.
""These attacks have resulted in monetary losses and have provided illicit revenue for the DPRK in violation of financial sanctions,"" the report said.

""These attacks are low-risk, high-reward, difficult to detect, and their increasing sophistication can frustrate attribution.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military on Monday disclosed a more than 50% jump in cases of traumatic brain injury stemming from Iran's missile attack on a base in Iraq last month, with the number of service members diagnosed climbing to over 100. 
No U.S. troops were killed or faced immediate bodily injury when Iran fired missiles at the Ain al-Asad base in Iraq in retaliation for the U.S. killing of Revolutionary Guard General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike at the Baghdad airport on Jan. 3.
The missile attacks capped a spiral of violence that had started in late December. Both sides have refrained from further military escalation, but the mounting number of U.S. casualties could increase scrutiny on the Trump administration's approach to Iran.
Reuters was first to report earlier on Monday that there were over 100 cases of TBI, up from the 64 previously reported last month.
The Pentagon, in a statement, confirmed that so far 109 U.S. service members had been diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury. It added that 76 of them had returned to duty. 
The U.S. military in the past had said to expect an increase in numbers in the weeks after the attack because symptoms can take time to manifest and troops can sometimes take longer to report them.
Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last month that the service members suffering from traumatic brain injuries had been diagnosed with mild cases. He added that the diagnosis could change as time passed.
Symptoms of concussive injuries include headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light and nausea. 
Pentagon officials have repeatedly said there has been no effort to minimize or delay information on concussive injuries. But the disclosures following Tehran's attack have renewed questions over the U.S. military's policy regarding how it internally reports suspected brain injuries and whether they are treated publicly with the same urgency as loss of limb or life.
U.S. Republican Senator Joni Ernst said more answers were needed.
""I've called on the Pentagon to ensure the safety & care of our deployed forces who may be exposed to blast injuries in Iraq,"" Ernst said on Twitter. 
U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to play down the brain injuries last month, saying he ""heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things"" following the attack, prompting criticism from lawmakers and a U.S. veterans group.
Various health and medical groups for years have been trying to raise awareness about the seriousness of brain injuries, including concussions.

Since 2000, about 408,000 service members have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, according to Pentagon data.

Mohamed Mediene and Athmane Tartag, along with Said Bouteflika, have been in detention since May, weeks after mass protests broke out demanding the departure of the ruling elite and the prosecution of people involved in corruption.
The appeals court in Blida, south of Algiers, handed a nine-month jail sentence to Louisa Hannoune, leader of the Workers Party, who was given 15 years in prison in a first instance sentence in September, along with Mediene, Tartag and Bouteflika.
Mediene, known as ""Toufik"", held the role of kingmaker for more than two decades, with power to name presidents, prime ministers, ministers and other senior officials.
Abdelaziz Bouteflika ruled for 20 years until he was ousted in April after protesters rejected his plan to seek a new five-year term in office. Said ran the government unofficially after his brother suffered a stroke in 2013.
Algeria has jailed two prime ministers, several ministers and prominent businessmen over corruption charges since the demonstrations erupted on Feb. 22.
Algerians are still staging weekly protests but their numbers have fallen significantly since the North African country elected Abdelmadjid Tebboune in a presidential vote largely rejected by the demonstrators."

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on Monday threatened a no-confidence motion against his own justice minister, posing a fresh risk to the survival of the fractious ruling coalition.
Renzi's small centrist Italia Viva party is in the coalition with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party (PD), but he has constantly taken issue with government policies since it was formed in September last year.
The latest long-running dispute involves the statute of limitations, which wipes out trials if a verdict is not reached within a set limit.
5-Star and the PD have a agreed a reform of the time limits and plan to push it through parliament with a vote of confidence, triggering the wrath of Renzi, who opposes the reform.
A confidence vote, used by governments to force legislation through parliament by truncating debate and sweeping away opposition amendments, would prevent any attempt by Italia Viva to block the reform.
""If there is a call for a confidence vote in the government, Italia Viva will present a motion of no-confidence against (Justice Minister Alonso) Bonafede,"" Italia Viva said in a statement.
Bonafede is from the 5-Star Movement, with whom Renzi has particularly fraught relations, and his move sharply intensifies the level of internal coalition conflict.
""A no-confidence motion against minister Bonafede means a no-confidence motion against the whole government,"" 5-Star lower-house leader Davide Crippa said in a statement.
During its previous coalition with the far-right League, 5-Star approved a law to scrap time limits for the prosecution of most crimes after a first judgement has been reached.
5-Star and the PD agreed to amend this to scrap the time limits only for those found guilty in a first trial, but Renzi wants to restore the old statute of limitations.

Renzi's party said it would present its no-confidence motion in Bonafede in the Senate, where on paper it would be likely to pass because the coalition has only a slim majority in the upper house even with Renzi's backing.

The army has suffered increasing losses in recent months at the hands of Islamist fighters, who have also stepped up attacks on soldiers and civilians in neighboring countries in the Sahel region, particularly Burkina Faso.
Escalating bloodshed in Mali's central and northern regions has prompted a rethink in Bamako, Keita told French media.
""Why not try to contact those who we know are pulling the strings,"" he said in a recording of the interview published by Radio France Internationale.
""The number of dead in the Sahel is becoming exponential. It's time for certain avenues to be explored.""
Keita did not say what was being done to talk to Islamist groups.
But he said former president Dioncounda Traore, his high representative to central Mali, ""has the task of listening to everyone"".
French forces intervened in 2013 to drive back jihadists who had seized northern Mali the previous year, but the militants have regrouped, capitalizing on intercommunal conflicts to recruit and to extend their reach into central Mali.
The International Crisis Group, a conflict prevention body, said last year that seeking dialogue with jihadists may encounter some opposition within Mali and abroad from those who fear it could legitimize the groups and their ideas.
The government has already said it will recruit 10,000 more soldiers to counter the jihadist threat, and France is sending 600 soldiers to add to the 4,500 it already has tackling armed groups in the Sahel or with a 14,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission in the region.
But the United Nations' top humanitarian official in Mali, Ute Kollies, said last week that extra troops would not solve the crisis and urged political engagement.
Last year, at least 456 civilians were killed and hundreds more wounded in central Mali alone in what was the deadliest year for Malians since the start of the unrest, Human Rights Watch said in a report on Monday."

CHICAGO/GENEVA (Reuters) - A week ago, only two laboratories in Africa could diagnose the novel coronavirus that originated in China and is rapidly spreading around the world. As of Sunday, the World Health Organization (WHO) expected every nation in Africa to be able to diagnose the disease.
The rush reflects a global push for diagnostic capabilities, particularly in developing countries, in hopes of averting a global pandemic. But it is being slowed by a desperate need for virus samples necessary to validate the tests.
""Without vital diagnostic capacity, countries are in the dark as to how far and wide the virus has spread and who has coronavirus or another disease with similar symptoms,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva on Monday.
As of early Monday, there had been 40,235 confirmed cases reported in China and 909 deaths, as well as 319 cases in 24 other countries, including one death.
Most of the testing is being done by public health laboratories. But several companies including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (NYSE:TMO), GenScript Biotech Corp and Co-Diagnostics Inc have developed tests and are taking steps to get them validated for clinical use.
Roche is distributing coronavirus tests developed by Tib Molbiol of Berlin for research use on some of its instruments while developing a test of its own.  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) also is working on a test.
WHO has activated a network of 15 referral laboratories that can support national efforts in confirming new cases, and has identified 168 labs globally with the technology to diagnose the virus.
Technicians must be trained to run the tests locally to avoid delays associated with having to send them to centralized labs.
On Tuesday, WHO is convening a two-day meeting of hundreds of researchers and manufacturers to address the outbreak.
WORKLOAD ON LABS IS 'EXTREME'
Researchers are also working to develop antibody tests that can tell whether someone has been exposed to the virus. They could help answer how broadly this virus has spread, and whether there are milder cases not being detected, Dr. Mike Ryan, head of the WHO emergency program, told reporters.
China appears to have adequate stock of the materials needed to perform diagnostic tests, but there is a limited number of trained technicians who can run them. ""The workload on those labs is extreme,"" Ryan said.
Outside of China, manufacturers are quickly developing tests based on the genetic code of the virus. Those tests still need to be validated with actual virus samples, for which access has been challenging.
Live isolation of the virus allows a huge advance in diagnostics and potential advances in therapeutics and vaccine development, Ryan said.
GenScript, which has offices in New Jersey and Nanjing, China, has developed a test available to researchers. It cannot be used as a diagnostic until it has been tested in hundreds of virus samples.
""In China, we couldn't get to the samples directly because we don't have a lab that can handle the virus,"" said Hong Li, a GenScript scientist.
The company has sent its test kits to Chinese health officials to assess their validity. ""Because other companies in China are also doing that, we don't know when it will be our turn,"" said Eric Wang, GenScript's head of marketing.
Utah-based Co-Diagnostics on Monday said it has started shipping its test, which is available for research purposes, to clients. Chief Scientific Officer Brent Satterfield said last week that the company has been struggling to find clinical virus samples to validate the test for use as a diagnostic.
Thermo Fisher developed its tests based on the genetic code of the virus, and ran computer models to validate it.
The company has been providing its test to countries and health ministries with access to virus samples, said Thermo Fisher executive Joshua Trotta. ""They will evaluate our kits and make a determination of what is the best test to deploy.""
Meanwhile, Thermo Fisher is scaling up production as countries prepare for more cases. Demand is ""growing every day,"" Trotta said."

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the Boko Haram group and rival Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) splinter group have often carried out attacks in the area.
The passengers were stranded on Sunday evening along a military check point due to the curfew imposed by the military in the town of Auno before the attack happened at around 2100 GMT, resident Bunu Ali who witnessed the attack said.
Auno is a town 24 km (15 miles) from Maiduguri, the state capital. Eyewitness said the insurgents attacked on motorbikes shooting sporadically. They set at least 18 vehicles ablaze and abducted several people, another eyewitness said.
Nigerian Army Commander said the casualty figure was much smaller because the military had recovered 10 bodies on Monday. The commander said the military closed the road at 1500 GMT to curb insurgency.
President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday condemned the attack, adding that the was receiving more military hardware and intelligence to counter the current security challenges, a statement from the presidential office said.
Borno state is the epicenter of the Boko Haram and ISWA insurgency. The conflict has lasted a decade, during which time the militants have killed thousands and millions have fled from their homes in the region."

The leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany met in Paris in December to discuss the long-running Ukraine crisis and agreed to get together again within four months to keep the dialogue open.
""I am confident that when leaders say they will meet in April then they will ... what I don't see though is the preparation,"" Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told reporters during a visit to Italy.
""Before the December meeting ... (preparations) started half a year beforehand. Now we have two months to go and I have not seen anything prepared. Maybe it will be a much faster process than last time and maybe we will make much more progress. I am sorry, but I doubt it.""
The conflict in eastern Ukraine that broke out in 2014 has killed more than 13,000 people, left a large swathe of Ukraine de facto controlled by Moscow-backed separatists and aggravated the deepest east-west rift since the Cold War.
The December summit did not produce the sort of breakthrough some had hoped for, such as an agreement on expanding a ceasefire zone, but it did lead to a prisoner exchange deal.
Prystaiko welcomed the subsequent large-scale prisoner swap that took place at the end of last year, but noted that more people had died in continued fighting in January 2020 than in the same month a year earlier.
""We haven't managed to achieve a ceasefire ... But even if we have just an exchange of prisoners, that is a good step for Ukrainians,"" he said."

LONDON (Reuters) - A British Uber (NYSE:UBER) driver, previously cleared of a sword attack on police outside Buckingham Palace, was convicted on Monday of a plot to kill people in the name of Islam at London tourist destinations including Madame Tussauds and the Gay Pride parade.
Mohiussunnath Chowdhury, 28, from Luton, north of London, boasted to undercover detectives about having deceived the jury after being acquitted of wounding police officers outside Queen Elizabeth's London home in 2017.
Chowdhury subsequently tried to obtain a gun, had information on his phone about how to attack people with knives, practiced stabbing and decapitation techniques, and discussed an attack using a van as a weapon.
Chowdhury was convicted at London's Woolwich Crown Court of preparing terrorist acts, possessing information useful to terrorism and disseminating a terrorist publication. He will be sentenced on March 13.
""It is very clear his intent was to kill and harm as many people as possible and he was prepared to die in doing so,"" said Richard Smith, head of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command. ""And, in his view, he felt that would make him a kind of martyr to his cause.""
Britain has suffered two Islamist attacks in recent months by people let out of prison early, which critics say has highlighted problems with its anti-terrorism strategy.
This month, a man released early from prison was shot dead by police after stabbing two people with a knife in a rampage on a busy south London street.
In November, another former convict, who had been convicted of being part of a group that plotted to bomb London’s stock exchange, killed two people and wounded three more before police shot him dead near London Bridge.
In 2017, Chowdhury injured two unarmed police officers, who suffered cuts to their hands from his sword when they fought to disarm him near Buckingham Palace as he shouted ""Allahu Akbar!"" (God is greatest).
In his defense, Chowdhury said he had trying to commit suicide, not attack anyone. But he later told undercover officers that he had been trying to carry out an attack and that he had deceived the jury, in part by shaving off his beard.
Police began to investigate Chowdhury in December 2018, within days of his release from prison, when he began posting messages extolling the virtues of becoming a martyr for Islam.
Chowdhury purchased a replica Glock gun and unwittingly told undercover officers about his plans to carry out an attack.
He spoke, for example, of the Madame Tussauds waxworks museum as a potential location because there were no traffic bollards there, and also considered attacking an open-top tour bus.
Chowdhury's sister was convicted of failing to disclose information about his plans to carry out an attack."

Several criminal cases have been opened against opposition leaders amid mass protests against the government and Bidzina Ivanishvili's ruling Georgian Dream party that began last summer, and several arrests have been made.
Ugulava was first imprisoned for a similar offense in September 2015, for four-and-a-half years, but was freed in January 2017 after his sentence was reduced.
A year later, Ugulava, mayor of Tbilisi from 2005-2013 and now one of Georgia's most active opposition leaders, was sentenced again, to 15 months in prison, in the same case, but his sentence was considered to have been served.
Monday's Supreme Court verdict is for a new case of alleged misuse of funds, and the jail time he has already served will not count against it.
""This is a shameful decision made by the Ivanishvili regime,"" Tina Bokuchava, a leader the opposition United National Movement, told reporters.
Critics accuse Ivanishvili, a business tycoon and leader of Georgian Dream, of running the country from behind the scenes.
Ugulava, one of the leaders of the European Georgian Party, said he had not pleaded guilty and the verdict was a ""legal farce"".
""The fact is that the path chosen by the opposition frightens Ivanishvili,"" he told reporters before going to prison.
Dozens of ex-officials including an ex-prime minister have been arrested on charges such as abuse of power and corruption since Georgian Dream came to power in 2012 after defeating then-president Mikheil Saakashvili's party in an election.
Western countries have expressed concerns that the government of the former Soviet republic of 3.7 million people has used selective justice to persecute political opponents, an allegation that officials deny.
Opposition parties are demanding a reform of the electoral system reform before a parliamentary election in October."

ATHENS (Reuters) - A legal technicality has led Cyprus to temporarily halt a process to strip citizenship from 26 individuals who benefited from a secretive passports-for-investment scheme, lawmakers said on Monday.
A lucrative citizenship for investment scheme run by the Mediterranean island has been under scrutiny both in Cyprus and abroad after the disclosure that some of the beneficiaries were high-ranking officials from foreign countries.
More than 3,500 people have gained citizenship under this scheme in recent years.
In November, Cypriot authorities announced they would revoke the passports of 26 individuals, saying the criteria under which citizenship was granted to some people was flawed.
Reuters had reported in October that a number of Cambodians, including its police chief and finance minister, had acquired Cypriot citizenship.
Cypriot government sources had said at the time the group whose passports should be revoked include nine Russians, eight Cambodians, five Chinese nationals, two Kenyans, one Malaysian and one Iranian.
Lawmakers from the Interior Committee of parliament were told on Monday the decision to strip passports could not proceed at present for legal reasons, two of those present told Reuters.
That was because, one said, the relevant law for granting investors citizenship lacked a supplementary clause on the process for revoking it.
""We have a problem with the law which can be fixed relatively easily,"" said George Perdikis, a lawmaker with the Greens party.
Nonetheless, he said, ""our jaws dropped"" when an interior ministry employee said there was a problem with the law as it currently stood. Left-wing lawmaker Eleni Mavrou, who chairs the Interior Committee, told Reuters there was a ""legal vacuum"" in revoking the passports. ""Today we were told that the process won't go ahead until a committee appointed by the government vets all the information,"" she said.
Cyprus has had a citizenship for investment plan in place since 2013, under which a minimum 2 million-euro ($2.2 million) investment can buy a passport and visa-free travel throughout the European Union.
Authorities say the program has gone through several transformations, and was overhauled in February 2019 with five different due-diligence layers, compared with one in 2013.
For transparency reasons, Cypriot lawmakers in February 2019 decided the eligibility criteria of the citizenship scheme be enshrined in law, instead of based on regulations set by the island's cabinet.
So far the government has not brought those regulations to parliament for discussion and a deadline set by parliament passed at the end of January.
""We have thrown down the gauntlet, we told them (the government) that since there are no regulations, any applications submitted after Jan. 31 can't be reviewed,"" Mavrou said."

Calvey and other executives at the group were detained in February 2019. They have denied wrongdoing and said the charges against them are being used to pressure them in a business dispute over control of Vostochny Bank.
The case against Baring Vostok has rattled Russia's business community and prompted several prominent officials and businessmen to voice concerns about the treatment of the executives.

Lawmakers last week toppled Orban's three-month-old minority government, potentially opening the way for an election that his Liberals (PNL) are confident of winning.
The next day, Iohannis, an ally of the centrist Liberals, asked Orban to form a new government.
That cabinet is set to be voted down in parliament - the first of two proposed governments that need to be rejected by lawmakers within 60 days to trigger an election, which would then take place a few months ahead of schedule.
Shortening the election cycle could be a relief for markets if it puts an end to years of political instability.
But analysts have warned that a snap election is hard to bring about, especially in view of Romania's fragmented and disparate parliamentary groupings.
They say the process of triggering it will mean weeks or months of wrangling and stall policymaking at a time when widening budget and current account deficits are pressuring Romanian shares and bonds and rating outlooks.
Orban's PNL has doubled its support in opinion polls to about 47% since 2016, while the Social Democrats (PSD) have broadly lost half their support, falling to about 20%.
PSD leader Marcel Ciolacu said he had turned to the Constitutional Court because a nominee for prime minister must come from a majority party or alliance and Orban, having lost a no confidence vote, did not meet this condition."

A wide variety of tools will be made available to remove the coca plants, the minister said, including the possible re-introduction of aerial spraying of the herbicide glyphosate.
The country has come under constant pressure from the United States, the principal destination for cocaine, to reduce coca cultivation within its borders since the end of 2017, when the area taken up by coca plantations hit 209,000 hectares.
The coca crop in 2017 had the capacity to produce 921 tonnes of cocaine, according to the U.S. government.
""Regarding the eradication target, we set a goal of 130,000 hectares, taking into account all the available tools,"" Trujillo told journalists.
The goal for coca eradication in 2020 is 30% higher than the previous year, when the Andean country managed to destroy a little more than 100,000 hectares of coca using manual removal techniques.
Colombia suspended aerial fumigation of glyphosate in 2015, after the World Health Organization said the herbicide was harmful to the environment and health, potentially causing cancer.
President Ivan Duque's government is working to meet various health and environmental requirements demanded by the Constitutional Court so it can restart aerial fumigation, possibly in the first half of this year.
Drug trafficking has long-fed Colombia's internal armed conflicts.

ANKARA/AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian government forces killed five Turkish soldiers in northwestern Syria on Monday, Turkey's defense ministry said, after Turkey deployed thousands of troops there to stem a Syrian government offensive.
The attack, on a newly established Turkish military base in Taftanaz in Idlib province, happened a week after eight Turkish military personnel were killed by Syrian army bombardment.
The two incidents were among the most serious confrontations between Turkish and Syrian troops in the nearly nine-year-long conflict in Syria, and Turkey has said it will drive back Syrian forces if they do not pull back by the end of this month.
""Their attacks against our posts have made an operation necessary,"" Omer Celik, spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party, told reporters in Ankara.
The rapid advance by Syrian government forces in Idlib, the last major enclave of insurgents opposed to President Bashar al-Assad, has driven nearly 700,000 people from their homes toward the closed-off Turkish border.
Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, says it cannot absorb any more and is ready for military action to halt the Syrian government advances.
It has poured 5,000 troops and convoys of military vehicles across the border, carrying tanks, armored personnel carriers and radar equipment to bolster its existing military positions.
The defense ministry said Turkish forces retaliated on Monday for the attack in Taftanaz, which also wounded five soldiers who were flown by helicopter back to Turkey.
""Targets identified in the region were immediately targeted intensively...and the necessary response was given. The targets were destroyed and the blood of our martyrs was not left on the ground,"" the ministry said.
A Turkey-backed Syrian rebel commander said the insurgents had also launched a military operation near the town of Saraqeb, south of Taftanaz, with Turkish artillery support.
'WAR OF ATTRITION'
As the conflict escalated in Idlib, Turkish and Russian officials met in Ankara for talks. The two countries back opposing sides in Syria, where Moscow's military intervention in 2015 helped swing the war decisively in Assad's favor.
Celik said there were no concrete results from Monday's meeting, the second in three days, and the talks would continue.
Russia and the Syrian government say they are fighting terrorists in Idlib, which is largely controlled by jihadist fighters.
""This is a war of attrition between Moscow and Ankara in which they are testing limits,"" said Galip Dalay, a visiting scholar at Oxford University.
While there was a risk that the crisis could escalate further, Dalay said it could be managed with agreement between Ankara and Moscow on a buffer zone on the Syrian side of the border with Turkey, where displaced people could shelter.
But the challenge of meeting the needs of the wave of uprooted people is growing daily.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Sinn Fein on Monday demanded inclusion in Ireland's next government after a record election showing, a move that would raise its central goal of reunification with Northern Ireland toward the top of the agenda in Dublin for the first time.
The left-wing Irish nationalist party stunned the establishment by beating the two center-right parties that have led every government in the country's history, almost doubling its vote share from the last election to 24%.
Sinn Fein's low number of candidates means, however, that it is likely to secure at best the second largest number of seats when two days of counting nears conclusion later on Monday - just behind the center-right Fianna Fail and around the same level as Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael.
Successive surveys suggested the Sinn Fein surge was based almost exclusively on the major campaign issues of healthcare and the high cost and low availability of housing, with the idea of Irish unity barely registering with voters. 
However the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army said ahead of the vote that a condition for any coalition would be immediate preparations for a referendum on unity with Northern Ireland, a British province, that it would push London to hold within five years.
""We have had a historic election. There is no doubt that the old politics of the two-party system is now gone and over, a thing of the past,"" Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald told national broadcaster RTE. ""This vote for Sinn Fein is a vote for Sinn Fein to be in government.""
Both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have insisted for years that they would not govern with Sinn Fein, citing differing economic policies and its past links to the IRA. The militant group fought against British rule in Northern Ireland in a conflict in which some 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace deal.
Fine Gael repeated its insistence on Monday while Fianna Fail said it saw significant hurdles to such a tie-up.
""We certainly will engage with them. We're not going to refuse to talk,"" Fianna Fail deputy leader Dara Calleary told RTE. ""But let's be in no doubt that those policy difficulties and those principles are still difficult hurdles.""
BORDER POLL?
Under the 1998 Good Friday deal that mostly ended decades of violence between Catholic nationalists seeking to merge Northern Ireland with Ireland and Protestant unionists who want it to remain part of the United Kingdom, Britain's minister for the region can call a referendum if a ""yes"" majority looks likely.
A vote would also be required in Ireland and an exit poll on Sunday showed that 57% of voters backed holding one within five years. Eighty-one percent of Sinn Fein supporters want a poll, compared to 52% of Fianna Fail voters and 44% among Fine Gael.
In its election manifesto, Sinn Fein said it wanted to establish a parliamentary committee and citizens assembly to plan for Irish unity.
McDonald, whose party members sang Irish rebel songs and flew the Irish tricolor flag as candidate after candidate were elected on Sunday, believes Britain would only consider calling a poll when Ireland is pro-actively planning for unification. 
Fianna Fail and Fine Gael also want to see the unification of the island - partitioned almost a century ago - but say now is not the time. Fianna Fail pledged in its manifesto to start some preparations, but nowhere near the level Sinn Fein wants.
The issue would probably be a critical point of negotiation and possible stumbling block in any government negotiation. Fine Gael and Fianna Fail could also continue to freeze Sinn Fein out with a coalition or minority government deal of their own.
A senior member of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which shares power with Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland, said he was not worried about Sinn Fein's surge in Ireland.
Gregory Campbell told BBC that Irish voters were not moving to Sinn Fein over the cause of Irish unity.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - From his dormitory in the locked-down Chinese city of Wuhan, PhD student Hassan spoke to his father in Pakistan for the last time on Thursday, as the 80-year-old begged him to come home. The next day, Hassan's father died of a heart ailment.
Hassan is one of more than 1,000 Pakistani students in China's Hubei province, thought to be the epicentre of the coronavirus, who have been told by their government that it has had to rule out their return home for the moment.
Hassan has since stepped up his efforts to travel home as his desperation grows, having missed his father's funeral, but received conflicting information from Pakistani officials.
""They need me at this time, my mother needs me,"" said the PhD computer architecture student, who asked to be identified only by one name in order to protect his family's privacy.
His increasing anxiety is shared by other Pakistani students in Hubei, some of whom are increasingly critical of their government's response to the situation.
Many other countries, including neighbouring India and Bangladesh, evacuated their citizens from Hubei province as the virus death toll rises, topping 900 on Monday.
The Pakistani students and their families, including young children, are stuck inside most of the day.
Four students told Reuters depression and anxiety was growing, their feelings worsened by fears of catching the virus and uncertainty as to how long the conditions would last.
""My very dear students in China...we r intensely discussing the situation @ highest level & will make the best decision in view of all factors with ref to devastating #coronavirus potential global pandemic,"" State Health minister Zafar Mirza said on Twitter on Sunday.
Hassan contacted his university, who supported him leaving, and Pakistan's embassy in Beijing. He said he was later told by Chinese authorities in Hubei that he could be evacuated if Pakistan's embassy in Beijing contacted them, but that had not occurred.
A Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
Hassan said he was then told by a Pakistani official on Monday that they were planning to evacuate all students.
But students in Wuhan told Reuters their hopes of returning were dashed after a video conference call between students and Pakistan's health and overseas citizens ministers on Monday afternoon in which an imminent evacuation was ruled out.
Some of the students said Pakistani officials had suggested Pakistan did not have the necessary quarantine facilities.
A spokesman for Mirza said in a statement the health minister had expressed concern for the welfare of students in the call and that Chinese rules meant no one could leave Hubei, but the situation was being monitored.
""After this call we don't have any hope from our government that they will evacuate students,"" said Sahil Hassan, another Phd student in Wuhan, who listened to the call. ""We are all completely disappointed with our government."""

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 10:07AM ET</span>",Exclusive: India readying $2.6 billion U.S. naval helicopter deal ahead of Trump trip,"By Sanjeev Miglani
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is set to give final approval to a $2.6 billion deal for military helicopters from U.S. defense firm  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) ahead of a proposed visit by U.S. President Donald Trump this month, defense and industry sources said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is trying to pull out all the stops for Trump's trip in a bid to reaffirm strategic ties between the two countries, which have been buffeted by sharp differences over trade, to counter China.
India's defense purchases from the United States have reached $17 billion since 2007 as it has pivoted away from traditional supplier Russia, looking to modernize its military and narrow the gap with China.
Modi's cabinet committee on security is expected to clear the purchase of 24 MH-60R Seahawk helicopters for the Indian navy in the next two weeks, a defense official and an industry source briefed on the matter separately told Reuters.
""It's a government-to-government deal, it is close,"" said the industry source.
To cut short lengthy negotiations between Lockheed and the Indian government, the helicopters that will be deployed on India's warships will be bought through the U.S. foreign military sales route, under which the two governments will agree details of the deal.
Trump is expected in India around Feb 24 on his first official visit to the country, although no formal announcement has yet been made.
Both countries are separately working on a limited trade agreement ahead of the trip, after earlier imposing tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's imports.
Trump has called India the ""tariff king of the world"" but the Modi government has been trying to address some of his concerns.
Trade officials have pointed to large-scale U.S. arms purchases, from surveillance planes to Apache (NYSE:APA) and Chinook helicopters, as proof of India's willingness to tighten strategic ties.
The multirole helicopters will be equipped with Hellfire missiles and are meant to help the Indian navy track submarines in the Indian Ocean, where China is expanding its presence.
Many of India's warships are without any helicopters because of years of underfunding, and the navy had sought their acquisition as a top priority.
The government outlined only a modest rise in its 2020/21 defense spending to $73.65 billion in the budget on Feb. 1, of which a part will go toward making a down payment on the helicopter purchase, a defense official said.
""We expect a positive announcement soon on the helicopters,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of service rules. ""There are limited resources, but there is an allocation.""
The U.S. State Department approved the sale of the choppers to India last year along with radars, torpedoes and 10 AGM-114 Hellfire missiles.
The clearance came after the Trump administration rolled out a new ""Buy American"" plan in 2018 that had relaxed restrictions on sales, saying it would bolster the American defense industry and create jobs at home.
The United States has also offered India the armed version of Guardian drones that were originally authorized for sale as unarmed for surveillance purposes, the first such approval for a country outside the NATO alliance.
India plans to buy 30 of these unmanned aircraft for surveillance of the Indian Ocean, at a cost estimated to be about $2.5 billion, from General Atomics.
However, the defense official said the deal is unlikely immediately because of lack of funds."

RINCON DE CHAUTLA, Mexico (Reuters) - When the 56-year-old mother-in-law of David Sanchez Luna was tortured and killed after venturing out of her small Mexican community encircled by drug cartels, he let his seven- and ten-year-old daughters receive military-style weapons training.
Unable to send their children to school and too afraid to step out of their enclave of 16 mountain villages in the violence-plagued southwestern Guerrero state, residents say they have been left with little choice.
""They do this to prepare themselves to defend the family, their siblings and defend the village,"" said Sanchez Luna, a corn farmer in a rugged region which five years ago formed a self-defense ""community police"" militia to protect itself.
The move by the villagers to offer arms training to school-age children shocked the nation and made global headlines last month after local media broadcast images of children as young as 6-years-old toting guns and showing off military maneuvers.
While elders in the mainly indigenous community near the city of Chilapa privately concede young kids would not be used to fight cartel gunmen, they say their gambit to get the help of far-away officials in Mexico City is borne of desperation.
Ten musicians from the area were ambushed and killed last month by suspected Los Ardillos cartel members after stepping out of the territory guarded by their self-defense militia, known as CRAC-PF. Their bodies were burnt, officials said.
The attack followed a spate of murders in recent year, including a beheading, that rattled the 6,500 residents whose lush land sits amid fertile poppy-growing farmland that feed Guerrero's heroin trade and supply routes to the United States.
The grisly murders and siege-like conditions facing residents go to the heart of cartel power and state failure in modern Mexico, where runaway violence tears at society's fabric.
""This is a public cry for help by a community that's been cornered,"" said Falko Ernst, an International Crisis Group (ICG) analyst. ""They've been trying to get assistance by federal and state government, unsuccessfully, so they're trying to escalate the language to try to negotiate and get help.""
President Manuel Andres Lopez Obrador said those who arm children ""should be ashamed of themselves"" and denounced the use of children to grab attention.
Lopez Obrador's government has struggled to get a grip on gangs and violence, with a record 34,582 murders last year.
Residents remain deeply suspicious of regional authorities and the smattering of local policemen in their villages, who they accuse of being the eyes and ears of the Los Ardillos.
Parents say their children are forced to stop formal education once they reach about 12 years of age, as the middle schools are in territory controlled by the cartel.
Abuner Martinez, 16, stopped attending school a year ago after his father was kidnapped outside CRAC-PF territory, tortured, and then beheaded. 
""I got scared at that moment. I didn't want to go to school,"" said Martinez, who now wields a shotgun as he guards a checkpoint.
The Los Ardillos want to extort the farmers and force them to grow opium for the cartel, said Sanchez Luna's brother, Bernardino, who founded the CRAC-PF. 
""We find ourselves under siege,"" he said.
CRAC-PF repelled a major attack by Los Ardillos in January 2019, but residents live in fear of the siren, a community alarm system, going off again.
Farmers tend their corn fields with shotguns slung on their backs, while armed CRAC-PF militiamen keep guard and patrol their territory round the clock.  
David Sanchez Luna's wife, Alberta, sobbed as she described receiving her mother's body riddled with torture marks.

""It's terrible what's happening to us,"" she said, wiping away tears.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece plans to accelerate the creation of detention centers on its outlying islands in the Aegean Sea after a backlash against overcrowded camps by some migrants and nearby residents.
Authorities said on Monday they would proceed with the purchase of land on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos, and press ahead with plans to create holding facilities on state-owned land on Kos and Leros.
Thousands of migrants are waiting on the islands for their asylum applications to be processed, most of them in overcrowded camps known as reception centers. 
Migrants on Lesbos protested last week against poor living conditions and residents of the island took to the streets demanding the reception facilities close.
""The government has decided to close today's anarchic facilities and create controlled, closed facilities,"" government spokesman Stelios Petsas said in a statement.
Hundreds of thousands of people crossed into Europe from Turkey via Greece in 2015 and 2016 before a deal brokered by the European Union limited the flow. There has been a resurgence in arrivals since around September 2019.
Last year, more than 74,000 refugees and migrants arrived in Greece, according to the United Nations refugees agency UNHCR. Most of them arrived on Lesbos, Chios and Samos after crossing from Turkey and about 40,000 are now in effect trapped on the islands. 
AID GROUPS SAY ACTION NEEDED
Aid groups have described living conditions in some of the island camps as appalling.
""We need 20,000 people to be transferred from the islands to the mainland in the next weeks and months to come,"" Philippe Leclerc, UNCHR's head in Greece, told journalists after a meeting with Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi.
Greece's conservative New Democracy government, elected last July, has taken a tougher stance toward migration than Syriza, the leftist party that led the previous government. 
The government has introduced new regulations which it says will simplify the asylum process and launched a tender for a floating fence in the Aegean which it hopes will deter migrants arriving from Turkey on rafts.
The new detention centers would house new arrivals until their asylum processes were underway, as well as others showing ""delinquent behavior"" or not entitled to asylum, Petsas said. 

Entering and leaving the facilities would be strictly regulated and they would be closed at night, he added.

1256,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 07:46AM ET</span>",China May Have Just Peaked as an Export Powerhouse,"(Bloomberg) -- Plenty of experts have lived to regret their predictions of the downfall, the collapse — the peak of anything China. But here it is. A bold call for the ages: We very likely have just witnessed Peak China (as an export powerhouse).
In the third quarter of last year 14% of all global goods exports came from China, according to data collated by the World Trade Organization. That was second only to the final quarter of 2015 when China’s share of global exports topped 15%.
That share may still be beat in the fourth quarter of 2019, data for which is not available yet. China’s exports remained robust in 2019. (We have the Chinese numerator for all of last year; we don’t yet have the full 2019 global denominator from the WTO).
But it certainly won’t be repeated in the first quarter of 2020 with what is a de-facto industrial shutdown in the world’s second largest economy because the coronavirus crisis likely to put a huge dent in Chinese exports this quarter.
Yes, history says epidemics tend to have fleeting effects on economies. As is the case with other natural disasters, the trough in one quarter is often followed by a steep recovery in the next. Which is why markets can be as sanguine as they seem to be.
The health crisis now underway is not happening in isolation, however. It is just the latest blow. There is more going on.
China’s export power was already under assault from President Donald Trump’s trade wars. Companies in the U.S. and Europe have been increasingly facing pressure to shift supply chains for geopolitical reasons. Worries over everything from espionage to human rights in Xinjiang have piled on more pressure to boot. China has also begun shifting its own export capacity offshore via President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative.
Add coronavirus and questions over the government’s response and it’s not a stretch to say that you’d have to be courageous — or Elon Musk — to build a factory in China today.
To be clear, the argument here is not that China is suddenly going to stop being the world’s assembly shop. Or a major economy. Or an export power.
It is simply that, for many reasons, there appears to be something structural happening to China’s relationship with the world and that the coronavirus shutdown will add to that, even if we come out of it soon. It’s hard to see China’s share of global exports growing much beyond this. That may in time be part of a bigger story with even bigger consequences for other economies and companies and markets. For the time being, though, it’s the only peak we’re willing to call."
1257,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",Merkel protegee Kramp-Karrenbauer won't run for chancellor: source,"By Andreas Rinke
BERLIN (Reuters) - The woman who had been expected to become Germany's next chancellor has decided not to run for the top job, a source in her Christian Democratic party (CDU) said on Monday, throwing into confusion the race to succeed Angela Merkel.
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer is CDU leader and a protegee of the chancellor but has faced growing doubts over her ability to replace Merkel, who has led Germany for 15 years but plans to stand down at the next federal election, due in autumn 2021.
Last week Kramp-Karrenbauer's inability to impose discipline on the CDU in the eastern state of Thuringia dealt a fresh blow to her credibility.
The regional CDU branch defied her by backing a local leader helped into office by the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), thereby shattering a postwar consensus among established parties of shunning the far-right.
Kramp-Karrenbauer's decision not to run for chancellor leaves a big question mark over Germany's future direction just as its economy, the world's fourth largest, flirts with recession and as the European Union struggles to define itself after Brexit.
Merkel has loomed large on the global stage since 2005, helping to steer the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening Germany's doors to migrants fleeing wars in the Middle East in 2015 - a move that still divides the bloc and her country.
Sigmar Gabriel, a former leader of the Social Democrats (SPD), junior partner in Germany's ruling coalition, told the mass-selling daily Bild he expected a snap federal election as the two main parties - Merkel's conservative bloc and the SPD - are struggling to unite their different factions.
But analysts played down that risk.
""This is largely a CDU internal issue,"" said Holger Schmieding at Berenbank. ""None of the candidates to succeed AKK (Kramp-Karrenbauer) toys with the idea of leaving the coalition with the centre-left SPD and/or triggering snap elections.""
He put the risk of the SPD quitting the coalition early at no more than 25%.
RIVALS CIRCLE
Kramp-Karrenbauer, 57, won a vote in December 2018 to succeed Merkel as CDU leader, though many remained unconvinced of her leadership credentials. [nL8N2823G2] 
The far-right scandal in Thuringia proved to be the last straw for Kramp-Karrenbauer, whose ratings plummeted last year after a number of public gaffes, including poking fun at trans-gender people in a light-hearted carnival speech.
Her erstwhile rivals for the party leadership - Friedrich Merz and Jens Spahn - have been circling with intent. 
Businessman Merz has quit asset manager Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) to focus more on politics and Spahn, now health minister, has cut a dynamic figure during the coronavirus crisis, jetting to Paris and London to coordinate the European and G7 response.
On Monday, shortly after news broke of Kramp-Karrenbauer's plan to step aside, Merz tweeted: ""Now's the right time to provide impetus via economic and financial policy measures.""
He said cutting taxes would boost private households' purchasing power and the ability of companies to invest.
Spahn and Markus Soeder, leader of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, both said they respected Kramp-Karrenbauer's decision and stressed that the cohesion of their conservative alliance was now essential.
The CDU source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Kramp-Karrenbauer would remain party chair until another candidate for chancellor has been found.
She believes the same person should serve as both chancellor and party leader and will organize a process in the summer to fill both roles, the source added.
Kramp-Karrenbauer wants to remain as Germany's defense minister and Merkel supports her on that, a German government spokesman said.
Alexander Gauland, honorary chairman of the far-right AfD, said Kramp-Karrenbauer had failed to implement the CDU's policy of ostracizing the AfD and added that such an approach was unrealistic in the long-term.
""Its party base has long since recognized this and has thrown the CDU, with its policy of exclusion, into chaos,"" he added.

QWAQWA, South Africa (Reuters) - Eight-year-old Musa and her older sister Moleboheng trudged down the ravine with buckets and drum bottles to fetch water from a filthy stream because they were thirsty and tired of waiting for trucks meant to deliver emergency water that never showed up.
But Musa never returned, her mother Phindile Mbele recalled, choking back tears. The little girl drowned in the stream, which is thick with sewage, mud and algae, probably pulled down by a strong underwater current.
""We rushed down there. She was still under the water... Two boys from the neighborhood went in and one carried her out,"" Mbele said. ""The house is empty without her. She was such a sweet, quiet child"".
Musa's death last month further enflamed the mood among residents of Mandela Park township on the edge of Qwaqwa in South Africa, turning intermittent protests over water shortages into a full-blown, week-long riot.
Protesters torched shops, overturned government vehicles and hurled bricks and bottles at riot police who responded with rubber bullets.
South Africans have protested for years over unreliable supplies of water and power, but chronic mismanagement has been compounded by the effects of last year's drought, the worst in a century, which has been linked to climate change.
""It rains here all the time but they say there's drought. Then how did that little girl drown because that stream was full?"" said Malgas ""Skinny"" John, 39, who used rocks and burning tyres during the January riot to barricade the road leading into Qwaqwa in a face-off with police.
""We have to strike and burn things, only then do we get water,"" said the unemployed father of two, as he queued with neighbors to fill his container from a water truck.
""We'll do it again, we'll keep burning things if we have to,"" John added.
Officials fear riots like the one seen at Qwaqwa could be a sign of worsening climate-linked instability to come, as dams and water pipes deteriorate further and the urban population continues to mushroom.
South Africa's water minister Lindiwe Sisulu has promised 3 billion rand ($203 million) to end the shortages in Qwaqwa. Its municipality owes half a billion rand for water, out of a national unpaid bill of nearly 9 billion rand.
But even Sisulu's own department has a 3.5 billion rand shortfall in maintenance funds, which it says risks a ""detrimental impact on the national economy"", especially if water supplies to the thirsty power utility Eskom and liquid fuel maker Sasol are disrupted.
""We've been drinking this brown, filthy water since 2016,"" said little Musa's mother Mbele.
""Nothing will change. I know, soon, I will have to go the same stream where my daughter died to get water."""
1259,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 06:49AM ET</span>",Irish vote may spell the end for Varadkar amid Sinn Fein surge,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish voters look likely to dump Prime Minister Leo Varadkar from power in an election on Saturday amid a surge by Sinn Fein that could alter the political landscape, even though the nationalist party is unlikely to win a place in government this time.
Opinion polls in recent days have pointed to the main opposition Fianna Fail winning the most seats and forming a multi-party coalition or minority government, with policies on the economy and post-Brexit broadly similar to those of Varadkar and his center-right Fine Gael.
However the left-wing Sinn Fein could win the popular vote if the vote reflects recent polls. On Monday, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was polling at 25%, ahead of Fianna Fail on 23% and Fine Gael on 20%.
Sinn Fein has put forward too few candidates to capitalize, as the groundswell of support caught the party itself off guard after it sunk to 9% at local elections last year. Analysts say it may only be able to gain a few seats and retain its position as the third largest party in parliament.
Yet while both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael insist they will not govern with Sinn Fein, citing its IRA past and differing economic polices, such an outcome would demonstrate an appetite for change in decades-long centrist Ireland.
The IRA fought against British rule in Northern Ireland in a 30-year conflict in which some 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace deal. Sinn Fein's ultimate aim is to unify Ireland and British-run Northern Ireland, where it shares power.
Polls close at 2200 GMT on Saturday and will be followed immediately by an exit poll giving the first indication of the outcome. Counting begins at 0900 GMT on Sunday with some results expected from the early afternoon.
""We just need change in Ireland, it's very obvious,"" said Eilis Wall, a 40-year-old preschool owner who traveled 200 km (125 miles)to Dublin from the western county of Clare on Wednesday to join thousands of childcare workers calling for better state funding.
""Fine Gael have really let us down and Fianna Fail were worse before that. I'm voting for change,"" she said, adding that meant switching to Sinn Fein from Fine Gael.
Wall said she plans to change careers away from childcare because she cannot save for a pension - the sort of economic worry affecting large swathes of voters who feel left behind amid a boom that has made Ireland's economy the fastest growing in the European Union for six straight years.
Varadkar had hoped the upturn his party has overseen since 2011 and his own diplomatic successes so far on Brexit - helping prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Britain's departure from the EU - would extend his near three-year premiership.
The strategy appears to have fallen flat amid domestic issues such as healthcare and housing.
The immediate beneficiary looks set to be Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin, a 59-year-old former teacher whose party suffered an unprecedented electoral collapse nine years ago after the government he was a member of had to seek an EU/IMF bailout.
The election could be most pivotal for Sinn Fein, which has moved on from the long leadership of Gerry Adams and is run by a new generation of politicians led by Mary Lou McDonald. The party has struck a chord with younger voters on the defining election issue: the cost and availability of housing.
""We're seeing a version of what we've seen elsewhere, a growing constituency, particularly among younger voters and those who feel left behind that the neo-liberal agenda has not worked for them,"" said David Farrell, professor of politics at University College Dublin.
""The gains Sinn Fein are making are consistent with what we're seeing in other democracies."""
1260,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 06:46AM ET</span>","NATO's image worsens sharply in France, United States, study shows","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO's public image in the United States and France worsened sharply last year, according to a Pew Research Center study, after U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron questioned the value of the Western alliance.
Positive views of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which relies on the commitment of its allies to collective defense, fell to 52% in the United States last year, from 64% in 2018, the study released on Monday said.
In France, where Macron said last year the alliance was experiencing ""brain death"" because of a perceived failure to help resolve world conflicts, support fell to 49%, from 60% in 2017 and 71% in 2009. A figure for 2018 was not available.
NATO diplomats have long feared that Trump's portrayal of NATO as an alliance in crisis might erode U.S. public support.
NATO, founded in 1949 to contain a military threat from the Soviet Union, relies on U.S. military superiority to face down a host of threats on Europe's borders, including a resurgent, nuclear-armed Russia and militant attacks.
While Macron's comments stunned other NATO leaders on the eve of a December summit in Britain, Trump has harangued allies since taking office in 2017 over perceived under-spending on defense. Trump threatened to pull America out of the alliance in 2018 and last year called low-spending allies ""delinquent"". 
The Pew study noted that several countries ""have soured on the alliance"", including Germany, where support for NATO fell to 57% in 2019, from 63% in 2018.
Macron has defended his remarks as a useful wake-up call for allies, who he said were too focused on defense spending and other internal issues, rather than relations with Russia, NATO-member Turkey in Syria and the Middle East.
In Britain, however, where NATO is taking on greater symbolic importance following the country's decision to leave the European Union, favorable views of NATO improved to 65% of Britons last year from 62% in 2017. 

Overall, the study said 53% of people in 16 NATO members had a positive opinion of NATO, with less than a third expressing a negative view. The alliance is seen most favorably in Poland and least liked in Turkey.

The men, aged 23 to 31 and mostly from the provincial city of Penza, were accused of planning attacks against the 2018 soccer World Cup and presidential election as part of an underground anarchist group called ""the Network"". Other charges included drug dealing and weapons possession.
They had all denied the charges, and some said they were tortured in custody to produce confessions. Dozens of their supporters chanted ""shame"" in the military court in Penza as it handed down its ruling.
Asked about the case on a conference call, the Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin was aware of the case, but that it would not be appropriate for him to intervene in it.
""The president has repeatedly looked into this situation and repeatedly ordered everything to be checked thoroughly to make sure everything is in line with the law,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Opposition leader Alexei Navalny described the sentences as ""horrific"" in a post on Twitter.
""These very young people's testimony about an imaginary terrorist organization were beaten out using torture. Any minister in the Russian government is ten times more of a criminal and a threat to society than these guys,"" he said."

Malaysia's ministry of transport said it had not received any new credible evidence to initiate a new search.
""However, the ministry will review any new evidence that it officially receives,"" the ministry said in a brief statement.
On Sunday, Australia's News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) reported that a new search could be mounted, possibly this year, based on new evidence that it said showed the plane could have ended up in an area adjacent to the previous search area in the Indian Ocean.
News Corp reported that U.S. exploration firm Ocean Infinity was in discussions with the Malaysian government to mount a new search on a no find no fee basis.
Ocean Infinity chief executive officer Oliver Plunkett said that ""no new search is imminent"", but the firm continues to engage with experts to identify where any new search might be launched.
""The Malaysian Government, rightly in our view, set a high bar before they will engage in that discussion,"" Plunkett said in a brief emailed statement.
""It was and remains our position that we hope to be able to offer our services to the Malaysian government again at some point in the future.""
Flight MH370 became one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries when it vanished on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014.
Malaysia, China, and Australia, called off a two-year, A$200 million ($130 million) underwater search in the southern Indian Ocean in January 2017 after finding no trace of the aircraft.
A second three-month search, led by Ocean Infinity, ended similarly in May the following year.

Nigeria has banned the import and export of all goods through its land borders since last August as part of what it describes as a campaign to tackle smuggling. Its smaller neighbors, many of whom rely on trade with Africa's biggest economy, have complained that this has caused severe hardship.
Heads of state from the Economic Community of West African States agreed Sunday night to set up a committee ""to study and make a full report on Nigeria's land border closure with her neighbors,"" said a statement from a spokesman for Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari.
There is no timeline for when the report is due, but it is meant to be completed ""as soon as possible,"" Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama said, according to the statement.
Since taking office in 2015, Buhari has introduced policies aimed at curbing imports and smuggling, to boost local manufacturing. Buhari has also been trying to boost revenues after a 2016 recession slashed income.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis will make the first trip by a pontiff in 10 years to the tiny Mediterranean island nation of Malta in May, where he is expected to defend the rights of migrants trying to reach Europe.
The Vatican said on Monday the pope will visit the country, which lies between Sicily and North Africa, on May 31.
Malta has been at the center of several disputes with Italy and other European nations over which one should take migrants rescued in the Mediterranean by ships from non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
Like Italy, it has sometimes closed its ports to humanitarian ships that have rescued migrants, saying they should be shared among EU nations.
The pope, who has made defense of migrants a major part of his papacy and has often called the Mediterranean a cemetery, has criticized the closing of ports.
Politically, the island is still reeling from the killing of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in a car bombing in 2017. Francis may pay tribute to her, according to a Vatican source.
Malta is important in the history of Christianity because a ship carrying St. Paul to Rome was shipwrecked there in about the year 60 AD while he was being taken to Rome.
Francis's trip to Malta is also seen as a tribute to its archbishop Charles Scicluna, who is the Vatican's most experienced sexual abuse investigator.
Scicluna's investigations have led to the defrocking of some of the Church's most notorious paedophiles in Mexico, Chile and other countries.
Scicluna has also been in the front line in the defense of migrants, sometimes criticizing government policies. In 2017 he visited the Phoenix, one of the NGO-run rescue ships plying the waters of the southern Mediterranean to save migrants from drowning.
Former pope Benedict XVI visited Malta in 2010 and Pope John Paul II went there in 1990 and 2001.
The trip will be Francis's first outside Italy this year. He is expected to visit Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea in September, according to diplomatic sources."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Monday said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had doubled to eight as the government declared the virus a serious and imminent threat, giving it additional powers to isolate those suspected of being infected.
Alarm over the coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China in December is driven by its rapid spread and the fact that infectious disease experts cannot yet know how deadly or contagious it is.
It has killed more than 900 people, most of them in China, and has spread to at least 27 countries and territories. The two deaths outside mainland China were in Hong Kong and the Philippines.
""Four further patients in England have tested positive for novel coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to eight,"" England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said.
The new cases were all known contacts of a previously confirmed British patient in France, and were identified by public health officials working to trace possible cases.
Health minister Matt Hancock declared the virus ""a serious and imminent threat to public health"", a step that gives the government more powers to isolate people.
""We are strengthening our regulations so we can keep individuals in supported isolation for their own safety and if public health professionals consider they may be at risk of spreading the virus to other members of the public,"" a health ministry spokesman said.
Arrowe Park Hospital, near Liverpool in northern England, and Kents Hill Park, in Milton Keynes, have been designated as isolation facilities."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Testing aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan has revealed 60 more confirmed cases of coronavirus, media said on Monday, as quarantined passengers took to social media to warn of depression setting in over their confinement.
Monday's figure takes to 130 the number of infections on the ship docked in Yokohama, domestic broadcasters TBS and NHK said, citing Japanese health ministry sources.
The health ministry's communication office had no information on the report when contacted by Reuters.
The Diamond Princess was placed in quarantine for two weeks upon arriving in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, on Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus.
About 3,700 people are aboard the ship, which usually has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670. Passengers have been allowed on decks in shifts to get fresh air and encouraged to regularly take their temperature.
""Lots of the passengers now are getting a bit of cabin fever,"" British passenger David Able said in a video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""Depression is starting to set in.""
Another said he hoped assurances about the effectiveness of quarantine and ventilation on board would prove true.
""I will get nervous if we pass 200,"" said the 43-year-old Hong Kong resident quarantined on the boat with his wife, child and several others of his family.
""Hoping best for those taken to hospital. At least two report back to us on Facebook that they are symptom free,"" said the man, who declined to be identified.
A passenger with the Twitter handle daxa_tw posted an audio clip of the captain announcing the discovery of 66 new cases.
Japan's health ministry is separating infection counts on the ship and evacuee flights from China from Japan's official tally. Domestic cases stand at 21.
The disease has killed 908 people, chiefly in mainland China, and infected more than 40,000."

Indonesia has a big and young population, but the OECD grouping of rich nations says just about 16% of its young adults have attained a tertiary education.
President Joko Widodo signed a free trade deal with Prime Minister Scott Morrison in Australia's capital of Canberra after the parliaments of both countries ratified the pact.
The campus ""will contribute powerfully to Indonesia's economic, social and technological development,"" Morrison told Australia's parliament.
Though neighbors, the two are not top economic partners and the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement aims to boost lagging trade and investment.
The deal, agreed last year by the trade ministers of the two nations in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, also allows Australia to invest in higher education in Indonesia, a sector previously closed to foreign business.
Monash Indonesia will offer studies for Master's and PhD degrees, as well as executive programs and other offerings, the university's president, Margaret Gardner, said in a statement.
The Melbourne-based university will begin short executive programs this year and enroll Master's degree students in the fourth quarter of 2021, it said.
Tariffs to be scrapped under the newly ratified deal include barriers to Australian agricultural exports and Indonesian-made footwear and textiles.
Indonesia will also push for car exports to Australia as Jakarta develops more capacity to produce hybrid and electric vehicles, Airlangga Hartarto, its chief economic affairs minister, said in a statement.
Australia valued trade between the neighbors at A$17.8 billion ($12 billion) in 2018-2019, making Indonesia its 13th largest trading partner.
Widodo also told Australia's parliament he wanted to work with the traditional Pacific power to expand influence in the region, in the face of China's stepped-up efforts to do the same."

NAKHON RATCHASIMA, Thailand (Reuters) - Mourners left flowers and written messages in front of the Terminal 21 shopping center in northeastern Thailand on Monday after a soldier's shooting rampage in which at least 29 people were killed.
Soldiers, mall staff and volunteers cleaned bloodstains from the front of the mall in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima, while others laid wreaths.
""Even though they are not my relatives or someone I know, but just walking by, I don't feel okay with what happened,"" said Thanaphorn Tongweraprasert, 29, who lives near the mall. 
A candlelight vigil was held on Sunday night as Buddhist monks led prayers and people laid down white flowers in memory of the victims of the attacker, who hit four locations around the city. 
""You have this rage, it fills you,"" said resident Chirathip Kurapakorn at the vigil.
""It just happened right here in our hometown behind us, like right in our heart of everything. It's just tragic.""
Many of those killed in the weekend attack were at the shopping center, the last stop for the soldier, who held out against an overnight siege with weapons stolen from his army base before being shot dead by security forces on Sunday.
The soldier, angry over a real estate deal gone awry, began his rampage by killing his commanding officer at a private home on Saturday.
He moved on to his military base, where he killed a guard and stole high-powered weapons and ammunition from the armory, and then fled in a stolen Humvee to a Buddhist temple, where he killed nine people before driving to the Terminal 21 mall.

At least 29 were killed and 57 wounded in total.

The incident, triggered by an argument over a right of way, led to a brawl between ethnic Kazakhs and Dungans, a minority group with Chinese roots, followed by an overnight rampage in which an angry crowd torched dozens of buildings and cars.
Tokayev has earlier blamed the violence on ""provocateurs"" who used an act of hooliganism to instigate larger-scale violence and said the local authorities would be punished for failing to prevent it.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - President Nayib Bukele and a group of soldiers armed with automatic weapons briefly occupied El Salvador's Congress on Sunday, stepping up a pressure campaign to force lawmakers to back a crime-fighting plan.
Watched by soldiers in full battle uniform, Bukele, 38, sat in the seat reserved for the president of Congress and cupped his hands together to pray, he said, for patience with lawmakers, few of whom turned up at the special session.
""If those shameless people don't approve the plan of territorial control, we'll summon you here again (next) Sunday,"" he told supporters in a fiery speech outside, as he left the building.
Lawmakers were due to meet on Monday to discuss the president's proposals, Congress president Mario Ponce said, in a possible sign of de-escalation.
Critics warned of a looming constitutional crisis, however. Human Rights Watch, a U.S.-based group, called the event ""an exhibition of brute force"" and said the Organization of American States should urgently meet to discuss the situation. 
Bukele won office last year after a savvy social media campaign feeding off popular discontent with two parties that had ruled the Central American country since the end of a civil war. 
Channeling that same frustration with traditional parties, he attacked Congress for foot-dragging over approval of a $109 million multi-lateral loan he has sought to equip police and soldiers to fight crime. 
His cabinet called Sunday's special session after Bukele said on Friday that Salvadorans had a legal right to insurrection in such situations, calling for protests and briefly removing lawmakers' security protection details. 
The president’s move to pressure lawmakers was backed by defense minister René Merino Monroy and police director Mauricio Arriaza Chicas.
However, El Salvadoran think-tank FUSADES said there were no grounds for the executive branch to call such a session, since Congress was functioning normally.
On Sunday, hundreds of Salvadorans responded to Bukele's call to demonstrate, waving banners and blowing whistles outside Congress, as soldiers and police officers stood by to protect them, a Reuters witness said.
""We are here because of the insecurity we have in our country, and the lawmakers do not want to recognize that,"" said Adelma Campos, a 43-year-old housewife. ""They do not want to work for the people who gave them their votes.""
Although the murder rate in El Salvador has declined steeply since Bukele took office, authorities continue to battle gangs that control vast territory in the Central American country.

In a statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called on Sunday for ""dialogue and full respect for democratic institutions to guarantee the rule of law, including the independence of the branches of public power.""

BAKU (Reuters) - Azerbaijan's ruling party was leading on Monday in a snap parliamentary election called by President Ilham Aliyev to consolidate power and speed economic reforms by replacing the old guard associated with his father.
Candidates from the ruling Yeni Azerbaijan (New Azerbaijan) party won about 65 of 125 seats in the single-chamber parliament, Mazahir Panakhov, the Central Election Commission (CEC) head, said early on Monday after counting the results from around 110 districts.
A host of small parties and independents loyal to the government took almost all the rest.
The single-chamber parliament is elected every five years through voting for individual candidates in electoral districts.
Aliyev, who has been in power for 17 years, called the election in December, nine months before it was formally due. Officials from his ruling party said the move was ""to support the president's policy on reforms and personnel changes"".
In October, Aliyev dismissed his influential chief-of-staff, Ramiz Mehdiyev, and made other high-profile changes including the appointment of 62-year-old economist Ali Asadov as prime minister.
The president criticized the pace of economic reforms and said he wanted to clear out government officials who had reached pensionable age, a move seen as intended to force out people from the era of his father, Heydar Aliyev.
Sunday's election - while not a full democratic contest - pit veteran lawmakers against young, Western-educated candidates from the same, ruling party in an effort to overhaul the legislature with more able technocrats.
""I would call this an authoritarian modernization project,"" said Thomas de Waal, a Caucasus expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think-tank.
""Old Soviet-style bureaucrats are being pushed out and younger, more professional figures are being given top jobs.""
Despite its energy resources, the country on the Caspian Sea struggles with unemployment, and many of the 10 million population see little benefit from the oil and gas it produces.
The mainstream opposition has accused the ruling party, which has governed for almost three decades, of holding the vote in unfair conditions.
""We are already observing a number of violations in polling stations where we have observers,"" the opposition Musavat Party's leader, Isa Gmbar, told Reuters.
A shake-up of the governing elite is not expected to bring any change in foreign policy. Azerbaijan is not aligned to any big regional grouping such as the European Union or the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union and its foreign policy is balanced between Russia, the West and Iran.
Aliyev has held power since he was elected in October 2003, two months before the death of his father who held power for a decade. He won elections in 2008, 2013 and 2018, and two separate referendums scrapped a two-term presidential limit and extended the presidential term to seven years from five.
He appointed his wife Mehriban Aliyeva first vice president, the second most powerful post after the president, in 2017.
Western nations have courted Azerbaijan because of its role as an alternative to Russia in supplying oil and gas to Europe, but various European bodies and rights groups have accused Aliyev of muzzling dissent and jailing opponents. Baku denies the accusations.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Indonesian president Joko Widodo told Australia's parliament on Monday that he wanted to work with the traditional Pacific power to expand influence in the region in the face of China's stepped-up efforts to do the same.
Aligning with Australia and not its giant Asian neighbor is a major step for Indonesia, which is the second-most populous country in the region and has been trying to provide aid and build alliances with smaller Pacific countries.
Indonesia last year said it would establish diplomatic relations with several Pacific island nations, pursue trade deals with Fiji and Papua New Guinea and create a 3 trillion rupiah ($219.06 million) fund to provide development aid or disaster relief to smaller countries.
The country wants a larger role, Widodo said, as the Pacific increasingly becomes the focus of diplomacy, aid and military investment by Western powers trying to counter China.
""Indonesia and Australia must become the anchors for developing partners in the Pacific region. Indonesia understands the development challenges,"" Widodo said in his speech.
Widodo said Indonesia and Australia are both grappling with climate change and natural disasters, giving them common ground with small Pacific nations.
The low-lying Pacific islands are on the front lines of global climate change, threatened by rising sea levels that have forced some residents to move to higher ground.
Many Pacific countries have turned to China for financing, a relationship that Western officials fear Beijing can exploit.
Australia, which historically has carried considerable influence in the Pacific, has in the last couple of years rapidly expanded its diplomatic presence and aid to the region in response.
China says it is simply trying to help smaller Pacific countries with economic development.
Several Pacific nations have backed calls for investigations into allegations of violence by security forces in Indonesia's easternmost region, Papua. Vanuatu has openly voiced support for the independence of the former Dutch colony Papua.
A separatist movement has simmered in Papua since it was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 in a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum. There has been a spike in violence since August, with demands for a new independence vote."

The media group broadcasts programming that attracts audiences of tens of millions of people, but it is disliked by President Rodrigo Duterte, who says it treated him unfairly when he campaigned to become president.
ABC-CBN's franchises are due to expire on March 30, but Congress has yet to start deliberation on several bills seeking the renewal of the company's 25-year licenses.
The request was the second of its kind against a media organization lodged by Solicitor-General Jose Calida, an ally of Duterte, who has been condemned by press freedom groups for making threats against the media.
""We want to put an end to what we discovered to be highly abusive practices of ABS-CBN benefiting a greedy few at the expense of millions of its loyal subscribers"", Calida said in a statement.
Calida said ABS-CBN had also violated foreign ownership rules as it has allowed foreign investors to invest in its Philippine Depositary Receipts.
ABS-CBN operated a pay-per-view channel without regulatory approval and was charging fees that were not supposed to be levied, he said.
Calida cited the same reason in 2018 in revoking the license of Rappler, a news website known for its tough scrutiny of the Duterte administration.
ABS-CBN reported the filing of the petition and said it would issue a statement later in the day. Shares of ABS-CBN Corp fell close to 3% in the first in the first 80 minutes of trading.
The National Union of Journalists in the Philippines said the solicitor general's petition was a ""direct attack on the freedom of the press and freedom of expression"".
Congressman Rufus Rodriguez said the case ""violates the separation of powers"" because Congress is a co-equal branch of the government.
The government had no immediate response to allegations it was seeking to intimidate the media. The administration has said it encourages a free and vibrant press and those it has taken legal action against had broken the law."

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's air force scrambled armed fighters on Sunday to intercept Chinese jets that flew around the island claimed by Beijing as its own, in a move denounced by Taiwan's Defence Ministry as a threat to regional peace and stability.
China has been flying what it calls ""island encirclement"" drills on-off since 2016 when Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen first took office.
Beijing believes Tsai, who won re-election last month, wishes to push the island's formal independence. She says Taiwan is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
In a statement, Taiwan's Defence Ministry said Chinese J-11 fighters and H-6 bombers flew into the Bashi Channel to the south of Taiwan, then out into the Pacific before heading back to base via the Miyako Strait, located between Japan's islands of Miyako and Okinawa, to the northeast of Taiwan.
""During this period, the national military appropriately used air reconnaissance aircraft and air defense forces in accordance with combat readiness regulations,"" it said.
It provided a picture of a Taiwan air force F-16 shadowing one of the Chinese H-6 bombers. Taiwan's official Central News Agency said the scrambled F-16s carried live missiles.
""The Chinese Communist's long-range far-out-at-sea missions have impacted regional security and stability and endanger the peace and welfare shared by all parties in the region,"" the ministry said.
China's Eastern Theatre Command, in a statement late on Sunday carried by the official People's Liberation Army Daily, said the aircraft carried out ""real combat-oriented training"".
""Taiwan and its island are sacred and inalienable parts of China. The Chinese military's combat ready patrol was a completely legitimate and necessary action aimed at the current situation in the Taiwan Strait and safeguarding national sovereignty.""
TAIPEI-BEIJING RELATIONS
The fly-by came as Taiwan's vice-president elect, William Lai, was returning from a visit to Washington, where he attended the high-profile National Prayer Breakfast, at which U.S. President Donald Trump spoke. China has denounced Lai's trip.
Relations between Taipei and Beijing have further plummeted in the past few weeks following the outbreak of the new coronavirus in China, with Taiwan accusing China of preventing the island from accessing full information from the World Health Organization (WHO) or attending its meetings.
Taiwan is not a WHO member due to China's objections, which says the island is merely a Chinese province whose interests in the health body are adequately represented by Beijing.
But in one small diplomatic breakthrough for Taiwan, the WHO said Taiwanese experts will participate this week in an on-line meeting of experts about the virus.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said this was a ""good start"" and that they would strive to take part in more WHO events.
Taiwan's WHO troubles last week became another flashpoint in Sino-U.S. ties, with the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva telling the agency to deal directly with Taiwan's government, drawing a sharp rebuke from China.

MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - A four-day downpour across Australia's east coast has brought relief after months of devastating bushfires and years of drought, but also widespread storm damage and forecasts of more wild weather to come.
The weekend drenching represented the biggest sustained run of rainfall in Sydney and surrounding areas for 30 years, dousing some bushfires and replenishing depleted dams across New South Wales, the country's most popular state.
Some rural areas received more rain in recent days than they had in the entirety of the past year - a startling and swift turnaround from the bushfires that have killed 33 people and ravaged large parts of the east coast.
""It's amazing what the smell of the rain can do to people's spirits,"" Ben Shields, the mayor of the inland city of Dubbo, told Reuters on the phone.
Like many other rural towns, Dubbo has been beset by duststorms and subjected to water restrictions on the back of a three-year drought.
James Jackson, a sheep and cattle farmer in the drought-hit Guyra district some 500 kilometers (311 miles) north of Sydney, told Reuters the region was starting to turn green again.
""This one event won't replenish the whole soil moisture profile, we'll need a couple of these, but this is certainly a good start for those people who got it,"" said Jackson, who is also the president of industry body NSW Farmers.
""I have two-year-old sheep who are seeing green grass for the first time.""
Bushfire warning signs were almost swamped by floods in several areas as the weekend rainfall cut power to tens of thousands of homes, caused travel chaos in Sydney and closed scores of schools for the start of the week.
Almost 400 millimeters (7.9 to 15.8 inches) of rain fell in the Sydney area and surrounding areas. The Warragamba Dam, which supplies about four-fifths of Sydney's water, jumped from about 40% to above 60% full in just over a week, the state's water authority said, shoring up water supplies for the city of 5 million.
The NSW Rural Fire Service's Sydney headquarters has been reconfigured to respond to floods and storm damage amid the rapid shift in the weather threat.
The NSW State Emergency Service, which responds to flood and storm damage, received more than 2,700 calls for help overnight, with the number of calls since last Wednesday topping 10,000, SES spokesman Andrew Richards said.
MORE RAIN STILL NEEDED
Parts of northern and inland NSW, along with southern Queensland, have been in drought since 2016, severely reducing river and dam levels while also creating the tinder-dry conditions that have fueled this season's deadly bushfires.
The weekend rain has put out one of the state's worst bushfires, Currawon on the south coast, which burned for 74 days, destroying 312 homes and razing nearly 500,000 hectares (1.2 million acres) of land, according to the NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS).
There were 33 fires burning as of Monday morning in the state but they were all at the lowest warning level of ""advice"" and mostly in southeastern areas where the rains were headed.
Flood evacuation warnings have been ordered for parts of the Conjola region, authorities said, where deadly fires razed dozens of homes on New Year's Eve. Thunderstorms are forecast for NSW and neighboring Victoria state in coming days.
Still, BOM forecaster Jane Golding said more rain was needed to end the country's three-year drought.
""I know that some farmers ... are feeling pretty optimistic. But what we really need is follow-up rain,"" she told reporters.
""The rainfall deficiency is so severe that the soil is dry to deep levels, so we really need that follow-up rain."""

1280,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2020 07:08PM ET</span>",Irish nationalists Sinn Fein demand place in government after strong election showing,"By Padraic Halpin and Graham Fahy
DUBLIN/CORK, Ireland (Reuters) - Irish nationalists Sinn Fein demanded on Sunday to be part of the next Irish government after the left-wing party secured the most votes in an election that leader Mary Lou McDonald described as a ballot-box ""revolution"".
The former political wing of the Irish Republican Army, which has recast itself as the main left-wing party, secured 24.5% of first-preference votes, almost doubling its share from the last election in 2016. 
That put it ahead of the center-right Fianna Fail on 22.2% and the Fine Gael party of Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at 20.9% in an election analysts described as a seismic shift away from Ireland's century-old, center-right duopoly.
""I think it is fair to say that this election has been historic. It is something of a revolution in the ballot box,"" McDonald told reporters after arriving at her election count to a huge ovation from party supporters.
But her party appeared set to fall behind at least one of its rivals in terms of seat numbers after the surge caught even it off guard and it stood far fewer candidates. It is unlikely to be more than a junior partner in government as a result.
The final results will not be known until Monday or later. It took the parties 10 weeks to form a government in 2016. 
Sinn Fein's ultimate goal is reuniting British-run Northern Ireland with Ireland and has said a condition for any coalition is the immediate preparations for a unity referendum it would push London to hold within five years.
She said Sinn Fein would talk to all parties about forming a government and that others should accept their responsibility to do the same.
""I do not accept the exclusion or talk of excluding our party, a party that represents now a quarter of the electorate, and I think that is fundamentally undemocratic,"" she said.
Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, which have between them led every government since the 1922 foundation of the state, ruled out a coalition with Sinn Fein before the election.
But although Varadkar reiterated his rejection because of ""principle and policy"", Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin declined to repeat earlier refusals to consider a coalition with Sinn Fein, saying only that there were significant incompatibilities on policy.
""Our policies and our principles have not changed overnight,"" he said. ""But what is important is that the country comes first.""
Some of his senior lawmakers disagreed strongly, however, with the idea of such a coalition.
IRA WAR
Sinn Fein has moved on from the long leadership of Gerry Adams, the face of the IRA's war against British rule in Northern Ireland - a conflict in which some 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace deal.
Irish tricolor flags were flown at a Dublin count center as Sinn Fein supporters were led in a chorus of the Irish rebel song ""Come Out Ye Black and Tans"" by a lawmaker jailed for possession of explosives in 1981.
Opponents of Sinn Fein say its high-spending promises and pledge to increase taxes on the wealthy would discourage foreign multinationals that employ one-in-10 Irish workers. 
But some parties have praised detailed policies such as a proposed rent freeze and the large-scale building of houses by the state to tackle the cost and availability of housing, the key election issue. 
Varadkar's Fine Gael, in power since 2011, were not certain to have more seats than Sinn Fein, the 41-year-old premier said.
Martin predicted Fianna Fail would emerge on top. 
Fine Gael's focus on the fastest-growing economy in the European Union and success in negotiating a Brexit deal that avoided a ""hard border"" with Northern Ireland - with border checks reinstated - failed to capture the imagination of voters more focused on issues such as health and housing.
Varadkar said he would talk to all parties except Sinn Fein about forming a government. The option of another minority government led by either Fine Gael or Fianna Fail or a first coalition between the two parties also remains. 

""It's not going to be easy to put a government together, for anyone,"" said Foreign Minister Simon Coveney of Fine Gael.

""We always stand up for Canadians in difficulty around the world"", Trudeau told a press briefing in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he is attending an African Union summit.
""Yes I did bring up the consular cases in Egypt with President al-Sisi"", he added Canadian engineer Yasser Albaz was arrested at the Cairo airport by Egyptian authorities about a year ago towards the end of his business trip. He has not yet been charged and his family previously told Canadian media they were concerned about his safety.
The detained Canadian's family said last year that his passport was confiscated when he attempted to board his flight to Canada and an Egyptian official told him that his name had been flagged for a probe.
Egypt has faced criticism for its human rights record, especially after mass arrests last year that came after rare protests against Sisi in Cairo and other cities in late September."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is receiving information on former Vice President Joe Biden and his businessman son, Hunter Biden, from President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, a top Trump ally in the Senate said on Sunday. 
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said Attorney General William Barr told him about the arrangement on Sunday morning and that Justice Department officials were evaluating Giuliani's information to determine whether it is genuine.
""The Department of Justice is receiving information coming out of the Ukraine from Rudy. He (Barr) told me that they have created a process that Rudy could give information and they would see if it's verified,"" Graham told the CBS News program Face the Nation. 
Justice Department officials were not immediately available for comment.
News of the arrangement surfaced days after the Senate acquitted Trump on impeachment charges that he abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. 
Trump had based his demands on unfounded allegations of corruption. House investigators alleged that Giuliani pursued damaging information about the Bidens in Ukraine as Trump's personal lawyer. 
Hunter Biden sat on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma while Joe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, was vice president. 
Two Republican senators - Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson - are also conducting an investigation of U.S. government records to determine whether there was a conflict of interest. 
Graham said he spoke to Barr and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr on Sunday, after Giuliani told an interviewer that he had unearthed key evidence from Ukraine. 
""They told me: 'Take very cautiously anything coming out of the Ukraine against anybody,'"" Graham said. 
""Any documents coming out of the Ukraine against any American, Republican or Democrat, need to be looked at by the intelligence services who have expertise - I don't – because Russia is playing us all like a fiddle.""
Graham said he would refrain from his own probe of the Bidens and concentrate instead on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court's decision to issue warrants that led to a federal investigation into allegations that Trump's 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia to interfere in the election. 
""Here's what I want to tell the president: I'm not going to be the Republican Christopher Steele,"" Graham said. 

Steele is the former British spy who produced a dossier on Trump that the FBI used in its Russia probe. Republicans have condemned the dossier as a sham document filled with Russian propaganda.

LONDON (Reuters) - Storm Ciara lashed Britain and northern continental Europe with heavy rain and wind speeds that reached more than 90 miles an hour (145 kph) in places on Sunday, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights, train services and sports matches.
More than 200 flood warnings were issued across Britain, which recorded a maximum wind speed of 93 miles an hour at Aberdaron in Wales. One severe flood warning was put in place in Yorkshire, northern England, where water was predicted to overflow flood defenses and potentially threaten lives.
The storm caused major disruption to transport across the region; in the Netherlands, around 240 flights to and from Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, one of Europe's busiest, were canceled as Ciara roared in off the Atlantic with gusts of up to 74 mph (120 kph).
In Germany, where Ciara was named Sabine, about 180 flights to and from Frankfurt airport - about 15% of all planned flights - were axed. Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), Germany's largest carrier, said it would cancel short and long-haul flights from Munich airport on Monday until 1200 GMT and 1300 GMT, respectively.
Lufthansa's budget unit Eurowings said it had suspended flight operations at Hamburg, Berlin, Hanover, Dortmund, Duesseldorf, Cologne and Stuttgart. Meanwhile, some British domestic and international flights were also canceled, from airports including Heathrow and Gatwick.
Train services also fell victim to Ciara's wrath.
German railway operator Deutsche Bahn warned of severe disruptions and said it would stop long-distance train travel across Germany, Europe's biggest economy, in the evening.
Britain's Network Rail said the weather had caused problems across its network, with fallen power lines, trees and even trampolines blocking tracks, and warned people not to travel unless they had to.
SPORT DISRUPTED
All shipping movements in and out of Britain's Port of Dover on the south coast were suspended and the Humber Bridge in northern England was closed to all traffic for only the second time since it opened in 1981.
London's eight royal parks, home to more than 170,000 trees, were closed and even the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace, a tourist draw, was also canceled.
Sporting events were also hit; Manchester City said its English Premier League soccer match against West Ham was postponed due to ""extreme and escalating weather conditions"", while Scotland's Women's Six Nations rugby match against England was among the other matches canceled.
All professional Dutch soccer matches were canceled, along with most outdoor sporting events."
1284,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2020 01:50PM ET</span>",'Death with dignity': Peruvian woman sues to end her life,"LIMA (Reuters) - After spending months in a hospital's intensive care unit four years ago to treat her incurable and debilitating illness, Ana Estrada decided that at some point she would want to die before it got worse. 
Estrada, 43, is bed-ridden with a condition that has atrophied her muscles since puberty. She does not want to commit suicide and her body is already very weak.
But under Peruvian law it would be a crime to help her die. Both assisted suicide and the act of killing a terminally-ill patient, called ""compassionate murder,"" are punished with prison time. 
Now Estrada is suing the state, hoping a judge will let her die, what she calls ""death with dignity."" 
""I contemplated doing it illegally,"" Estrada told Reuters on Friday from her bed, where she was helped by a nurse.
""But there was risk ... because I cannot let someone help me die. I cannot ask a relative to commit a crime."" 
In this deeply Catholic country, where abortion and gay marriage remain illegal, Estrada and her lawyers see the fight to allow her to die as a first step to legalize euthanasia in Peru. The battle to die, Estrada said, has energized her life. 
Euthanasia is not allowed in many countries, and the Catholic Church remains a staunch opponent. In Latin America, Colombia has allowed it under certain conditions. 
Estrada has lived since her teenage years with polymyositis, an inflammatory disease that atrophies her muscles and has no cure. She is bed-ridden and breathes most of the time through a ventilator, so her voice is reduced to a whisper.
Lawyers from Peru's public ombudsman's office have taken up Estrada's case, arguing that not letting her choose to die is unconstitutional, violating her right to live with dignity. A constitutional court will now examine her case, which was filed last week. 
""We mold the stories of our lives with our decisions, and it does not make sense that in the last chapter of our life we are not allowed to make the decision (to die),"" Peru's public ombudsman Walter Gutierrez said at a press conference on Friday. 
Estrada's case gained prominence from a blog where she wrote about her illness, which she typed out slowly, letter by letter as her muscles lost strength. She is not getting better and most of the time cannot speak. 
She does not know when she will want to die, only that her condition will keep worsening and she would like to end her life when she can no longer bear it. 
""Why death with dignity? Because I want to avoid the suffering,"" Estrada said. ""But most of all because this is about how I live my life, about liberty. I do not feel free right now. I don't have the freedom to choose over my own body.""

A ministry statement said the bombing took place in the Bordj Baji Mokhtar region. It was not known who carried out the attack, the first suicide bombing in Algeria for several years.
The conflict in neighboring Libya and deteriorating security across another of Algeria's borders, in Mali, have both fed concerns of armed militant groups growing more active in the Sahara and Sahel regions of North Africa.
In 2013, an Islamist militant group staged an attack on the Tiguentourine gas processing facility in southern Algeria that killed dozens of people including foreigners.
That was the deadliest spasm of militant violence in Algeria since a 1990s civil war between Islamist groups and the state in which more than 200,000 people died.
Algeria is already wrestling with a major political crisis after a year of mass protests that helped oust the veteran president, but which continue with demonstrators demanding the ruling elite be fully replaced.
It also faces economic problems, with declining energy sales contributing to a fall in state revenue and planned cuts in public spending this year."

A bill on holding the referendum on April 5 was adopted by parliament earlier this week and signed by President Armen Sarkissian on Sunday.
The constitutional amendments would suspend the powers of seven judges who were appointed before a peaceful revolution against corruption and cronyism which brought Pashinyan to power two years ago. The court's two other judges, who were appointed later, will maintain their powers.
Pashinyan on Thursday called the Constitutional Court's decisions a ""threat to democracy"".
Last September the court ruled that a criminal case against Armenia's former president Robert Kocharyan was partly unconstitutional. Kocharyan has been charged with acting unlawfully by introducing a state of emergency in March 2008, following a disputed election.
""The only hope of the former corrupt regime is pinned on the Constitutional Court and its president Hrayr Tovmasyan,"" Pashinyan told parliament on Thursday.
Tovmasyan was charged in December with abuse of power while he was the country's justice minister. He has denied the charges.
The seven judges were appointed by the Republican party, who ruled the country at the time, and former president Serzh Sarksyan.
Members of the Republican party, now in opposition, criticized the decision to hold the referendum.
""This is an illogical, illegal and unconstitutional change,"" the party said in a statement."

The gunman was arrested at the police station. The two officers were being treated in hospital and were expected to fully recover from their wounds, officials said at a news conference.
""This was an attempt to assassinate two police officers ... it was a premeditated effort to kill,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said. ""An attack on a police officer is an attack on all of us.""

Conservative Switzerland, unlike many of its western European neighbors, does not yet have laws that specifically protect lesbians, gays and bisexuals from discrimination.
Parliament passed a law in 2018 to widen the application of anti-racism statutes, so that offenders would face jail for up to three years. But opponents obtained the 50,000 signatures necessary under Switzerland's system of direct democracy to put to the matter to a vote, which was held on Sunday.

The government backed the new law, and supporters' campaign posters featured two pink hearts rubbing up against each other under an umbrella. Opponents framed the change to the law as an infringement of free speech.

Swiss voters on Sunday also rejected a second initiative calling for at least 10% of new housing to be built by not-for-profit cooperatives in an attempt to reduce the cost of living. The same pollster projected that only 42% of voters had backed that proposal, again with a margin of error of 3 points.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey has sent major reinforcements to Syria's northwestern Idlib region and ""all options are on the table"", a senior official said on Sunday, as Ankara tries to stem rapid advances by Syrian government forces.
The government offensive in Idlib, the last major enclave of opposition to President Bashar al-Assad, has driven more than half a million people from their homes toward the closed Turkish border, threatening a new humanitarian crisis in Syria.
Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, says it cannot absorb any more and has demanded Damascus pull back in Idlib by the end of the month or face Turkish action.
Large convoys of military vehicles carrying tanks, armored personnel carriers and other equipment have crossed into Syria to reinforce a dozen Turkish military positions, several of which are now surrounded by advancing Syrian troops.
""There was a serious troop and military equipment support sent to Syria’s Idlib region in recent weeks,"" the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.
Three hundred vehicles entered Idlib on Saturday, bringing the total to around 1,000 this month, he said. He declined to say exactly how many new troops had been deployed, but described it as a ""notable amount"".
""The observation points have been fully reinforced,"" the official said. ""The Idlib front has been strengthened.""
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said 1,240 Turkish military vehicles crossed into Idlib in the last week, along with 5,000 soldiers.
The fighting in Idlib has shaken the fragile cooperation between Turkey, which backs rebels who once hoped to topple Assad, and Russia, whose support helped the once-beleaguered president bring most of the country back under his control.
On Monday, eight Turkish military personnel were killed in shelling by Syrian government forces, prompting Turkey to tell Russia to ""stand aside"" while its forces to bombard dozens of Syrian army targets in retaliation.
""The regime, with Russia’s support, has been violating all agreements and accords,"" the official said. ""We are prepared for any event. Of course, all options are on the table.""
Despite Turkey's disagreement with Russia over Idlib, the official described talks between them in Ankara on Saturday as positive. The two sides will meet again in the coming week.
'TURKEY WILL ACT'
Syria's armed forces said on Sunday they have recaptured more than 600 square kilometers (230 square miles) of territory, taking control of dozens of towns and villages in recent days, and said they would maintain the fight.
""Our brave army will continue to carry out its sacred duties to clear the entire geographic territory of Syria from terrorism and its supporters,"" the armed forces said in a statement.
Ankara has urged Moscow to rein in the Idlib offensive, which has brought Syrian government forces within 10 miles (16 km) of the provincial capital Idlib city, home to more than 1 million people.
Defence Minister Hulusi Akar reiterated on Sunday that they must pull back soon. ""If the regime forces are not withdrawn by the end of February, we will take action,"" he told Hurriyet newspaper in an interview.
On the eastern flank of the opposition-held enclave, the Observatory said advancing government forces had seized all but a 2 km stretch of the M5 highway, Syrian's main north-south road which links Syria's two main cities Damascus and Aleppo.
Pope Francis called on Sunday for respect of humanitarian law in Idlib, saying reports from the province were ""painful ... particularly regarding the conditions of women and children, of people forced to flee from a military escalation""."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A U.S. envoy warned Israel on Sunday not to declare sovereignty over West Bank land without Washington's consent, pushing back against calls for immediate action by ultra-nationalists within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition.
U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan, unveiled on Jan 28, envisages Israel keeping key swathes of the occupied territory where Palestinians seek statehood. But the question of timing has opened up a rare rift between the allies.
Netanyahu initially pledged a speedy ""application of Israeli law"" - de facto annexation - to Jewish settlement blocs and the Jordan Valley, delighting his religious-rightist base ahead of Israel's March 2 election, where he hopes to win a fifth term.
But he was forced to backpedal after the White House made clear it wanted a U.S.-Israeli mapping process - likely to take weeks or more - completed first. 
The Palestinians, for their part, have rejected the Trump plan as a non-starter.
With Defence Minister Naftali Bennett and other Israeli ultra-nationalists urging an immediate cabinet vote on sovereignty in the West Bank, the U.S. ambassador intervened.
""Israel is subject to the completion (of) a mapping process by a joint Israeli-American committee. Any unilateral action in advance of the completion of the committee process endangers the Plan & American recognition,"" envoy David Friedman tweeted.
In a separate speech, Friedman elaborated that his message was ""a little bit of patience, to go through a process, to do it right, is not something which we think is too much to ask for"".
'POTENTIALLY ADVERSE'
""With the news out that the (Israeli) cabinet was about to be pushed in a direction that was potentially adverse to our view of the process, we just let people know where we stand,"" he told the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA) think-tank.
""It was not a threat.""
In parallel, Netanyahu invoked the White House position.
""The (U.S.) recognition is the main thing and we don't want to endanger that,"" the premier told his cabinet on Sunday.
At the JCPA, Friedman said the mapping process was unlikely to be completed before March 2. But he held out the possibility of implementation even if the election does not produce a clear winner, as was the case twice in the last year.
Asked if Washington first wanted a permanent Israeli government - as opposed to a caretaker government of the kind Netanyahu has headed by default for months - in place, Friedman said: ""We have not made that demand.""
Most countries consider Israeli settlements on land captured in the 1967 Middle East war to be a violation of international law. Trump has changed U.S. policy to withdraw such objections and the prospect of Israeli annexations have drawn widespread condemnation. 
Palestinians say the settlements make a future state unviable. Israel cites security needs as well as biblical and historical ties to the land on which they are built.
""Any unilateral step is rejected whether it is taken before or after the election,"" said Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. ""Facts can't be created on the ground and they will never become a reality.""
""The only thing we can accept is the Palestinian map on the 1967 borders,"" Abu Rdainah added. 

On Saturday, Netanyahu told an election rally that the mapping process with the Americans was already under way. ""We've been waiting since 1967 and some people are making a big deal out of a few weeks,"" he said, alluding to rightist rivals.

YANGON (Reuters) - Hundreds of Myanmar nationalists rallied in the country's commercial capital on Sunday in a show of support for the military, amid tensions between the civilian government and the army ahead of elections expected later this year.
Around a thousand protesters marched from Yangon's famed Shwedagon pagoda to City Hall downtown to accuse the administration of Aung San Suu Kyi of allegedly failing to protect the country's Buddhist majority and for proposing constitutional amendments that would reduce the power of the military.
The proposed reforms have led to tensions between Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) and military lawmakers, who hold a veto over amendments. [nL3N1ZT2FP]
Speaking at the rally, nationalist activist Win Ko Ko Latt criticized those planning to push through the reforms, comparing them to the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China.
""We can see how deadly the Wuhan virus is,"" he said, referring to the Chinese city where the outbreak was believed to have originated.
""I declare from here that those people who are trying to change (the constitution) are more frightening than the Wuhan virus.""
Government spokesman Zaw Htay and NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt did not respond to calls from Reuters seeking comment.
Other speakers at the rally protested against remarks made by Myanmar's religious minister last month in which he allegedly blamed the military-controlled Home Affairs ministry for the government's failure to arrest several nationalist figures for sedition and inciting violence.
The figures include nationalist monk Wirathu, who is known for his harsh rhetoric against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority.
Police issued an arrest warrant for Wirathu last year after he criticized the civilian government and made fiery speeches targeting Suu Kyi.
Protesters were seen carrying banners saying ""No Rohingya"" during Sunday's rally, the first held in support of the military since the United Nations' highest court ordered Myanmar to take measures to protect the minority group last month.
More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims were forced to flee northern Rakhine state in 2017 after a military crackdown that the United Nations has said was executed with genocidal intent.
The army has denied any wrongdoing, describing the crackdown as a legitimate counter-insurgency operation in response to attacks on security forces by Rohingya militants."

1298,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2020 06:49AM ET</span>",Irish vote may spell the end for Varadkar amid Sinn Fein surge,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish voters look likely to dump Prime Minister Leo Varadkar from power in an election on Saturday amid a surge by Sinn Fein that could alter the political landscape, even though the nationalist party is unlikely to win a place in government this time.
Opinion polls in recent days have pointed to the main opposition Fianna Fail winning the most seats and forming a multi-party coalition or minority government, with policies on the economy and post-Brexit broadly similar to those of Varadkar and his center-right Fine Gael.
However the left-wing Sinn Fein could win the popular vote if the vote reflects recent polls. On Monday, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was polling at 25%, ahead of Fianna Fail on 23% and Fine Gael on 20%.
Sinn Fein has put forward too few candidates to capitalize, as the groundswell of support caught the party itself off guard after it sunk to 9% at local elections last year. Analysts say it may only be able to gain a few seats and retain its position as the third largest party in parliament.
Yet while both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael insist they will not govern with Sinn Fein, citing its IRA past and differing economic polices, such an outcome would demonstrate an appetite for change in decades-long centrist Ireland.
The IRA fought against British rule in Northern Ireland in a 30-year conflict in which some 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace deal. Sinn Fein's ultimate aim is to unify Ireland and British-run Northern Ireland, where it shares power.
Polls close at 2200 GMT on Saturday and will be followed immediately by an exit poll giving the first indication of the outcome. Counting begins at 0900 GMT on Sunday with some results expected from the early afternoon.
""We just need change in Ireland, it's very obvious,"" said Eilis Wall, a 40-year-old preschool owner who traveled 200 km (125 miles)to Dublin from the western county of Clare on Wednesday to join thousands of childcare workers calling for better state funding.
""Fine Gael have really let us down and Fianna Fail were worse before that. I'm voting for change,"" she said, adding that meant switching to Sinn Fein from Fine Gael.
Wall said she plans to change careers away from childcare because she cannot save for a pension - the sort of economic worry affecting large swathes of voters who feel left behind amid a boom that has made Ireland's economy the fastest growing in the European Union for six straight years.
Varadkar had hoped the upturn his party has overseen since 2011 and his own diplomatic successes so far on Brexit - helping prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Britain's departure from the EU - would extend his near three-year premiership.
The strategy appears to have fallen flat amid domestic issues such as healthcare and housing.
The immediate beneficiary looks set to be Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin, a 59-year-old former teacher whose party suffered an unprecedented electoral collapse nine years ago after the government he was a member of had to seek an EU/IMF bailout.
The election could be most pivotal for Sinn Fein, which has moved on from the long leadership of Gerry Adams and is run by a new generation of politicians led by Mary Lou McDonald. The party has struck a chord with younger voters on the defining election issue: the cost and availability of housing.
""We're seeing a version of what we've seen elsewhere, a growing constituency, particularly among younger voters and those who feel left behind that the neo-liberal agenda has not worked for them,"" said David Farrell, professor of politics at University College Dublin.
""The gains Sinn Fein are making are consistent with what we're seeing in other democracies."""
1299,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2020 06:28AM ET</span>",Pope calls for respect of humanitarian law in Syria's Idlib amid escalation,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis called on Sunday for respect of humanitarian law in Syria's Idlib province, amid an escalation of a Syrian government offensive that has displaced more than half a million in two months.
He told tens of thousands of people in St. Peter's square that the reports from Idlib were ""painful ... particularly regarding the conditions of women and children, of people forced to flee from a military escalation.""
Turkey has reinforced its military presence in the area, saying the advances by Russian-backed Syrian troops and their allies threaten a fresh humanitarian disaster.
The crisis risks driving another wave of potential refugees to Turkey's southern border, and Ankara has threatened to act unless there is a pull back.
""I renew my heartfelt appeal to the international community and all parties involved to use diplomatic means, dialogue and negotiations, in respect of international humanitarian law, to safeguard the lives and fate of civilians,"" Pope Francis said.
He then led the crowd in a special spontaneous prayer ""for this beloved and martyred Syria"".
Turkey and Russia support opposing sides in Syria's nearly nine-year civil war, but have forged a series of agreements since 2017 aimed at containing the bloodshed.
Turkey already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees and President Tayyip Erdogan threatened this week to repel the Russian-backed Syrian forces unless they withdraw from the region.

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2020 06:11AM ET</span>",How Bernie Sanders’ passionate base revitalized his campaign,"By Simon Lewis
DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - When Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders suffered a heart attack in October, what upset his long-time supporter Craig Althof the most was the way it was covered by the media.
In the opinion of 65-year-old Althof, who had a similar procedure to Sanders to prop open an artery, journalists were too quick to write Sanders' political obituary, speculating that the 78-year-old’s second White House run was likely over.
""I’m a two-stent guy, just like Bernie,"" said the substitute teacher in Newton, Iowa. ""It opened people’s eyes that they’re out to get him.""
Four months later, the progressive firebrand's turnaround -- a virtual tie for first place with Pete Buttigieg in last week's Iowa caucuses and another strong showing likely in New Hampshire on Tuesday - is at least partly thanks to the passion of supporters like Althof, who says the way the U.S. Senator was written off reminds him of the 2016 nominating race - which Sanders ultimately lost to Hillary Clinton - all over again.
Those fans were determined that the outcome would be different this time.
In the week following the heart attack, staff and volunteers held nearly 300 events in Iowa alone, from house parties to canvassing outings, and made 800,000 calls in four days to early voting states including Iowa and New Hampshire, campaign officials told Reuters at the time.
Days later, Sanders won the most sought-after progressive endorsement from first-term Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the first of a string of endorsements.
More than any of the other 10 Democrats vying for the right to take on Republican President Donald Trump in November, Sanders leans heavily on this fervent core of supporters for donations and for canvassing voters, an approach summed up by his slogan ""Not me, us.""
Sipping a beer at Sanders' post-caucus party in Des Moines last week, Michael Tunney, 34, said he traveled from Los Angeles to knock doors for Sanders, and was planning to do the same in Nevada ahead of the caucuses there.
“It’s easy to do because you don’t feel like you’re selling something,” he said. “When you knock on doors you have nothing to be ashamed of, it’s not like your a used car salesman, because you know you’re right on all the issues.""
Sanders raised $96 million in 2019, more than any other Democratic contender. In January alone, Sanders raised $25 million, according to the campaign, some of which would be put into the 14 states that vote on March 3, known as Super Tuesday.
These are all strong signs Sanders may be building a progressive version of the populist wave that swept Trump into office in 2016, observers say.
But the analogy to Trump is exactly what makes many skeptics uncomfortable.
Sanders' fiercest supporters can be unwilling to countenance criticism of their candidate and seem ready to back him almost no matter what he does.
Sanders himself has shown no interest in reaching out to the Democratic Party's moderate wing, which rivals believe would become a major liability if he became its nominee.
Instead, the self-described Democratic Socialist has continued to push the message in recent weeks that he is taking on establishment Democrats.
""We are their worst nightmare,"" he said in a Sioux City rally on Jan. 26, referring to the party hierarchy as well as Trump and business interests that he said were ""nervous"" at the idea of him in the White House.
'STAUNCH ON HIS VALUES'
That unapologetic stance may have helped him with many liberals who had been weighing him versus fellow liberal U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was building momentum with a similar policy platform before Sanders' heart attack. Both support Medicare for All - a single, government payer system that would all but eliminate private healthcare.
Warren's separate proposals since then - that she would finance Medicare for All without any tax increases on the middle class, and that she would seek a gradual transition into the system - have sparked criticism from all sides.
Moderates accused her of lying to taxpayers. And more than a dozen Sanders supporters who had been considering Warren told Reuters in recent weeks they saw the idea of a transition as a sign she was moving to the center.
Sanders won 26.1% of state-delegate equivalents in Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses, just behind Buttigieg's 26.2% but well ahead of Warren, who finished third with 18%, and former vice president Joe Biden, who had 15.8%.
""I feel like Warren is becoming less progressive to kind of cater to Republicans. That’s what Hillary did in 2016 and it obviously didn’t work,"" said Marisa Rude, 19, a freshman at the University of Iowa, who switched from Warren to Sanders in the past month and was volunteering for his campaign in January.
""So that’s why I’m for Bernie. I think he’s staunch on his values.""
TWO DOORS A SECOND
Sanders held on to some key staff in Iowa from his 2016 campaign and had built up a formidable organization by October, with 112 staff working out of 16 offices.
His campaign spent nearly $6 million to air television ads 20,272 times in Iowa, according to data published last week by Wesleyan Media Project. Only billionaire Tom Steyer and Buttigieg outspent Sanders on TV in the state.
In Iowa, the campaign said it knocked on 500,000 doors in January. At one point staffers and volunteers knocked on two doors every second over a five-hour period, said Misty Rebik, Sanders' Iowa state director.
In the days before the caucuses, Sanders' campaign was looking strong - enough to prompt moderates to try to stop his surge, airing television ads arguing that a socialist cannot win in many of the states beyond Iowa.
Supporters like Rod Sanders, 53, dismissed those concerns.
""I’d rather have the guy over here who’s trying to get me the best deal possible, instead of conceding from the start,"" he said. ""And maybe America needs scaring a little bit."""

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Indian-held Kashmir was hit by a general strike on Sunday called by the separatist Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) to mark the anniversary of the death of a Kashmiri man who was executed for his part in an attack on India's parliament in 2001.
The JKLF on Thursday called for strikes on Feb. 9 and Feb. 11 to observe the anniversary of the death of Afzal Guru, and then that of its founder Maqbool Bhat.
Shops and businesses were shut on Sunday, while there was little traffic on the roads in Srinagar and other parts of Indian-held Kashmir.
Indian troops have erected iron barricades and laid concertina wire in parts of the region to block roads, with armed soldiers in full riot gear patrolling the streets to prevent any protests, a government official said.
He said low speed mobile internet, which was restored last month, had also been shut down as a precautionary measure.
Last month, India's Supreme Court rebuked the government for shutting down the internet and telecommunications in Jammu and Kashmir, which was India's only Muslim-majority state before it was split into two federally administered territories.
Indian police, meanwhile, have launched legal proceedings against JKLF for calling the strikes.
The JKLF was banned by India last year as part of a massive clampdown in Kashmir after an attack on Feb. 14 in which 40 Indian troops were killed. Its offices were closed and main leaders, including its chairman Yasin Malik, were detained.
On Feb. 9, 2013, Afzal Guru was hanged after the Supreme Court upheld a verdict that he was involved in a 2001 attack on parliament.
Maqbool Bhat was hanged in New Delhi's Tihar jail on Feb. 11, 1984, following his conviction for the killing of a police official."

The shootout on Saturday between Afghan and American soldiers resulted in deaths on both sides but casualty details on the Afghan side were not shared. 
The firefight broke after a combined U.S. and Afghan force completed a ""key-leader engagement"" at the administrative headquarters of Nangarhar province's Shirzad district, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan said.
""Current reports indicate an individual in an Afghan uniform opened fire on the combined U.S. and Afghan force with a machine gun,"" Colonel Sonny Leggett said the statement.
""We are still collecting information and the cause or motive behind the attack is unknown at this time,"" he added.
The Taliban has not claimed responsibility for the attack and senior officials were investigating if it was an insider attack often known as ""green-on-blue"" attacks that have been a regular feature of the conflict in Afghanistan.
""The attacker who opened fire was also killed during the clash,"" said Sohrab Qaderi, a provincial council member in Nangarhar.
Qaderi said the Islamist fighter had infiltrated himself among dozens of members of the Afghan security forces involved in the joint-operation, but did not say which group the militant belonged to.
There have been fewer of these incidents in recent years as the Americans have taken more of a supporting role, with Afghan forces leading the fight. 
Though, last year the top American and NATO commander in Afghanistan, General Austin Miller, survived a shooting by a Taliban infiltrator in an Afghan military uniform. A top Afghan general walking next to him was killed.
The latest shooting comes at a delicate time, with American and Taliban negotiators pushing for a peace deal.
Nangarhar, which shares a long and porous border with neighboring Pakistan, had long served as stronghold for Islamic State in Afghanistan, though the Taliban also controls parts of the province.
About 14,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Afghanistan as part of the U.S.-led NATO mission to train, assist and advise Afghan forces and to carry out counter-terrorism operations.

""The Zafar satellite will be placed in orbit today from Semnan at a speed of 7,400 kilometers,"" Iranian Minister of Information and Communications Technology Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi said, according to the official IRIB news agency. 
Iran carried out at least two failed satellite launches last year.
The United States says it is concerned that long-range ballistic technology used to put satellites into orbit could also be used to launch nuclear warheads. Tehran denies that satellite activity is a cover for missile development and says it has never pursued the development of nuclear weapons.
President Donald Trump's administration reimposed sanctions on Iran following Washington’s 2018 withdrawal from an international accord designed to curb Iran’s nuclear program.
Trump said the nuclear deal did not go far enough and did not include restrictions on Tehran’s missile program.
Tensions, already high over the nuclear issue, reached the highest level in decades between Iran and the United States after Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3. Iran retaliated with a missile attack against a U.S. base in Iraq.
Once the satellite is in orbit, the first picture that it will transmit will be of Soleimani, minister Azari-Jahromi said on Sunday.
Iran launched its first satellite Omid (Hope) in 2009 and the Rasad (Observation) satellite was sent into orbit in June 2011. Tehran said in 2012 that it had successfully put its third domestically-made satellite Navid (Promise) into orbit.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Organizers scrambled on Sunday to shore up the Singapore Airshow, which is going ahead under a cloud of health and economic concerns after dozens of exhibitors pulled out of Asia's largest aerospace gathering due to coronavirus fears.
Few deals are expected at the biennial event, where health warnings have triggered new safety measures and cast a shadow over airline profits and demand for airplanes.
After years in which the airline industry has become used to weathering external shocks from epidemics to security threats, one of the industry's leading showcases has itself been thrust into the spotlight as the number of deaths in mainland China, where the virus first erupted, rose above 800.
More than 70 exhibitors have pulled out of the Feb. 11-16 show, usually a magnet for planemakers, suppliers and arms buyers due to strong demand for civil jetliners coupled with weapons demand fed by regional power rivalries.
""Based on our assessment of the situation today...we have decided to proceed with the trade and public days,"" said Tan Kong Hwee, assistant managing director of Singapore's Economic Development Board.
Organizers advised trade visitors to avoid shaking hands and to choose alternative forms of greeting such as bowing or waving hands. The number of public tickets available will be halved.
Singapore on Friday raised its coronavirus alert level and reported more cases not linked to previous infections or travel to China. It advised non-essential large-scale events should be deferred or canceled, but said the air show would go ahead.
Organizers said they were expecting more than 930 companies from 45 countries and 45,000 trade attendees - down from last time.
In 2018, there were 54,000 trade attendees and 1,062 firms as the event contributed S$343 million ($247 million) to the local economy through hotels and other spending, according to organizers. The show also attracts high-level foreign delegations.
Five delegates privately expressed surprise the show was going ahead, but organizers insisted they had a responsibility to those who wished to attend.
""It has grown to such stature and importance it is a very important part of the entire ecosystem of the global aviation industry,"" said Leck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events, partly owned by ST Engneering and government agencies and which manages the show and exhibition site.
SUPERPOWER FLIGHT DISPLAY
This year's depleted gathering comes against the backdrop of slowing passenger growth in Asia, down to 4.2% in 2019 from 7% in 2018 as economies cool their recent expansion, according to the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines.
""Already, there were signs of weakness in the cycle and then coronavirus comes along,"" said Rob Morris, head consultant at UK-based Ascend by Cirium.
""Given how much bigger China is today as a part of the global economy and the global airline traffic, the potential for impact is clearly much greater than it was for SARS back in the 2000s,"" Morris said, referring to a 2002/2003 viral outbreak.
The crisis further complicates a challenging picture caused by the 11-month-old grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX, he added. Both Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus have reduced attendance at the show.
Air freight, which feeds a significant proportion of Asian airline revenues, has had its weakest performance since the financial crisis in 2009 amid U.S.-China trade tensions.
This week's show will still feature a rare head-to-head, superpower fighter display from the United States and China.
The United States will fly the F-35B a month after it gave approval for Singapore to purchase up to 12 of the jets.
Manufacturer  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) has, however, pulled out of show and the Pentagon has reduced its participation.
The announcement of the first appearance of China's People's Liberation Army Air Force aerobatics team, Ba Yi, with J-10 fighters was a last-minute surprise, given Singapore's travel restrictions due to the virus that led 10 Chinese exhibitors to pull out from the show.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged governors of U.S. states and territories on Saturday to adopt a ""cautious mindset"" when engaging in business with China, saying Beijing was seeking to use U.S. openness to undermine the United States.
In a speech to the National Governors Association in Washington Pompeo said China was pursuing a policy of exploiting U.S. freedoms to ""gain advantage over us at the federal level, the state level and the local level.""
""When it comes to doing business, I'm asking you to adopt a cautious mindset. In the words of President Reagan, when you are approached for introduction or a connection to a deal, 'trust but verify,'"" he told the governors representing the 55 U.S. states and territories.
Pompeo, in his latest warning of what he sees as Beijing's intentions, emphasized that competition with China was not just a federal issue.
""It's happening in your states, with consequences for our foreign policy and for citizens that reside in your states ... and affects our capacity to perform America's vital national security functions,"" he said.
Pompeo said the Chinese approach was organized and methodical, adding, ""I’d be surprised if most of you in the audience have not been lobbied by the Chinese Communist Party directly.""
Beijing has denounced Pompeo's comments targeting the ruling Communist Party as vicious attacks and said any attempts to smear China or obstruct its growth were doomed to fail.
Pompeo on Saturday said Chinese Communist Party friendship organizations had been established to expand Chinese influence in ""Richmond; Minneapolis; Portland; Jupiter, Florida; and many other cities."" Chinese diplomats, he added, had sought to sway local elected officials on issues such as Taiwan, which Beijing sees as a renegade province.
He also referred to Chinese efforts to recruit scientists and professors at universities around the country to obtain technological know-how.

KABUL (Reuters) - U.S. and Afghan forces came under attack in eastern Afghanistan on Saturday, officials said in Kabul as they launched investigations into what the New York Times described as a deadly shootout between Afghan and American soldiers during a joint exercise.
The Times, quoting two Afghan officials, reported that five or six American soldiers and six Afghan soldiers were killed. The newspaper quoted a U.S. military official saying there were at least six American casualties and confirmed that there were fatalities without saying how many.
Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said a combined U.S. and Afghan force conducting an operation in Nangarhar province was engaged by direct fire.
Officials in Afghanistan did not comment on the number of casualties. 
""We are assessing the situation and will provide further updates as they become available,"" he said.
Mubariz Khadem, a senior security official in Nangarhar, said the clashes took place between U.S. and Afghan forces and casualties were feared.
Insider attacks, often known as ""green-on-blue"" attacks, have been a regular feature of the conflict in Afghanistan, although their frequency has diminished in recent years.
A senior Afghan defense official told Reuters it was not clear whether the incident was a result of clashes between Afghan and foreign forces or whether hardline Islamist militants were responsible for the attack.
""We are not ruling any possibility out but we are not calling it an insider attack, Taliban attack, or 'green-on-blue' at this stage,"" said the official who requested anonymity.
Taliban sources were not immediately available to comment.
Sohrab Qaderi, a provincial council member in Nangarhar, said clashes happened between the Afghan army and foreign forces in Shirzad district on Saturday afternoon.
He said members of the Afghan forces had been operating in the area since last month, and foreign forces were also in the district to defend against Taliban attacks.
""It seems that clashes happened between Afghan and foreign forces during a raid or maybe there was a tactical mistake,"" said Qaderi.
Investigations of past rogue attacks had uncovered many reasons for so called ""green-on-blue"" shootings, including frustration with the 18-year war in Afghanistan against the Taliban and other hardline Islamist groups.
About 14,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Afghanistan as part of the U.S.-led NATO mission to train, assist and advise Afghan forces and to carry out counter-terrorism operations.
U.S. diplomats have been talking with the Taliban for months to agree a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces in exchange for security guarantees.
Despite talks between the United States and the Taliban to end the war, violence in the country has not ebbed.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2020 05:55PM ET</span>","On the campaign trail: Biden ad slams Buttigieg, 'What you've done matters'","By James Oliphant and Joseph Ax
MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuters) - Democrats scrambled to gain an edge with voters on Saturday on the last weekend before the party's next presidential nominating contest in New Hampshire, where Pete Buttigieg began drawing fire as the candidate on the rise.
The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, ended up in a virtual tie with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in results that trickled in from Monday's Iowa caucuses. Both men claimed victory, while U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren followed in third place and former Vice President Joe Biden trailed in fourth. 
The problems that plagued the caucuses overshadowed any victory bump before New Hampshire's contest on Tuesday and cast a pall as the Democratic Party began the process of picking a nominee to face Republican President Donald Trump in November.
Here is what is happening in New Hampshire on the campaign trail.
EMPHASIS ON THE MAYOR
After what has been a mostly affable Democratic campaign, Biden's team pulled off the gloves and targeted the 38-year-old Buttigieg with a withering digital ad that pits Biden's decades of experience in public life against that of the former mayor.
The ad makes liberal use of popular former President Barack Obama in a belittling rundown of the ex-mayor's small-town issues and also takes a swipe at his troubled record with African Americans. 
It shows Biden helping pass the Affordable Care Act while Buttigieg installed decorative lights under city bridges; Biden helping secure the Iran nuclear deal while Buttigieg negotiated lighter regulations for pet chip scanners; Biden helping save the U.S. auto industry while Buttigieg ""revitalized the sidewalks of downtown South Bend"" with decorative brick.
The ad, which will run on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and YouTube in New Hampshire, extols Biden's work on the assault weapons ban, while noting that Buttigieg forced out the city's black police chief.
""We're electing a president. What you've done matters,"" the ad says in closing.
Buttigieg spokesman Chris Meagher derided the spot as Washington politics as usual that trivialized the concerns of ordinary communities. ""The Vice President’s decision to run this ad speaks more to where he currently stands in this race than it does about Pete’s perspective as a mayor and veteran,"" he said.
Biden, 77, finished a distant fourth in Iowa and all but conceded he would lose New Hampshire in the first moments of a Democratic debate on Friday night.
For months, people close to the Biden campaign had said going negative would be harmful to his political brand, which is built around empathy and optimism.
But his poor finish in Iowa seems to have altered that calculus. In New Hampshire, he has been much more critical of his rivals by name. The Buttigieg ad marks a significant escalation that likely carries some risk of blowback.
FRONT-RUNNER TO UNDERDOG?
At a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire, Biden began to re-frame himself as an underdog. 
""I've never paid attention to all this front-runner talk since I entered the race."" He listed various political and personal setbacks on his life. ""I know nothing comes easy.""
He repeated his warning that nominating Buttigieg or Sanders would be an unacceptable risk for Democrats.
In line with the ad, he made light of Buttigieg's tenure as mayor of South Bend, saying there was a difference between managing the budget of a small city and his own work marshaling the $900 billion Recovery Act economic stimulus package through Congress after the 2008-2009 recession.
Of Sanders, Biden said for all his time in Congress, Sanders had made no progress in getting his Medicare for All plan passed. ""He hasn't been able to move the ball a single inch.""
AN EDGE FOR BUTTIGIEG
The latest Suffolk University tracking poll of New Hampshire Democratic voters shows Buttigieg with 25% to Sanders' 24%, within the 4.4 point margin of error and showing a clear split between the moderate from Indiana and the party's progressive standard-bearer from neighboring Vermont.
In the two-day tracking poll of 500 likely Democratic primary voters, Buttigieg has risen 14 points since the first poll was published Feb. 3.
Warren, Sanders' fellow liberal from next-door Massachusetts, was third with 14% and Biden finished fourth with 11%, the poll showed. The other candidates were in single digits with 7% of voters undecided.
A CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center showed Sanders still holding a lead but with Buttigieg swiftly gaining on him. 
BACKING BLOOMBERG
Campaigning far from New Hampshire, in Oklahoma City, billionaire Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg racked up another endorsement on Saturday, this one from a Michigan Democrat elected in 2018 in a district that Trump carried two years earlier.
U.S. Representative Haley Stevens, one of 31 Democrats who represent congressional districts that Trump won in 2016. ""Michigan needs an economic champion in the White House,"" she declared in a statement.
Another of those Democrats, former Navy helicopter pilot Mikie Sherrill, endorsed Bloomberg on Thursday, as did the former Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer, who on Friday became the first high-level former Trump administration official to back a Democratic hopeful in the 2020 election.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel has begun to draw up maps of land in the occupied West Bank that will be annexed in accordance with U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed peace plan, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday. 
""We are already at the height of the process of mapping the area that, according to the Trump plan, will become part of the state of Israel. It won't take too long,"" Netanyahu said at an election campaign rally in the Maale Adumim settlement.
Netanyahu said the area would include all Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley - territory Israel has kept under military occupation since its capture in the 1967 Middle East war but which Palestinians want in a future state.
""The only map that can be accepted as the map of Palestine is the map of the Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital,"" said Nabil Abu Rdainah, spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. 
Prospects for annexations, which have already been widely condemned, are unclear. 
Israel will hold a national election on March 2 and Netanyahu, who is facing criminal corruption charges, is hoping to win a fifth term in office. He presently heads a caretaker government, whose legal authority to annex territory is still undecided by judicial authorities. 
Settlers make up part of Netanyahu's right-wing voter base and many members of his coalition cabinet view the West Bank as the biblical heartland of the Jewish people.
Most countries consider Israeli settlements on land captured in war to be a violation of international law. Trump has changed U.S. policy to withdraw such objections. 
Palestinians say the settlements make a future state non-viable. Israel cites security needs as well as biblical and historical ties to the land on which they are built.
Trump's plan envisages a two-state solution with Israel and a future Palestinian state living alongside each other, but it includes strict conditions that Palestinians reject.
The blueprint gives Israel much of what it has long sought, including U.S. recognition of settlements and Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley. 
A redrawn, demilitarized Palestinian state would be subject to Israeli control over its security, and would receive tracts of desert in return for arable land settled by Israelis.
Right after Trump presented the plan on Jan. 28, Netanyahu said his government would begin extending Israeli sovereignty to the settlements and the Jordan Valley within days. 
But Washington then appeared to put the breaks on that and Netanyahu has since faced pressure from settler leaders to annex territory despite any U.S. objections.

(Reuters) - Reluctant to go outside for fear of catching the new coronavirus sweeping the Chinese city of Wuhan, Edward Wang found a lifeline: grocery delivery services provided by local retailers.
But with hundreds of thousands of other people in Wuhan also stuck inside their homes doing the same thing, and retailers struggling to get hold of their staff, the service became overloaded.
So for Wang, now in Canada after flying out of Wuhan on an evacuation flight, a daily ritual developed during his days on virtual lockdown in the city.
At the turn of midnight, grocery stores would open up their order book for the day's deliveries, and he would pounce to place his order before all the delivery slots were taken by other customers.
""You have to be very quick,"" he told Reuters by phone.
""Usually, if they release their inventory at midnight, the day before, you basically have to finish by 12:02 or 12:03, so within 2 or 3 minutes, otherwise, all the delivery schedules are booked up.""
""There are basically no delivery people working right now. Basically for those stores, it is just the store manager driving their own private car around the neighborhood trying to deliver groceries.""
Wang grew up in Canada, and has family in Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. He was in Wuhan when the coronavirus outbreak hit.
Eventually, he left Wuhan on board a U.S.-chartered evacuation flight, and then, with other evacuees, he transferred to another plane that landed on Friday at a Canadian military base in Trenton, Ontario. 
He recorded video footage on the plane after it landed, showing a Canadian immigration official, dressed in a face mask and goggles, addressing passengers.
The official said that on disembarking, they would go through a sanitary footbath, and would have to hand over their used face masks and be given fresh ones. 
""Welcome home,"" he said to the passengers.
The evacuees will now stay in quarantine in the Trenton military base for 14 days. 
Wang said once he had been cleared as free of the virus by Canadian medical authorities, he planned to head to Vancouver, where his family has a home.
""I have not been in this kind of situation before, where I had to be evacuated from somewhere. You imagine things like this happening in war zones,"" he said.
He said he had weighed his options before deciding to fly to Canada. In Wuhan, he could limit the chance of infection by avoiding contact with other people. By boarding a plane, he would potentially put himself in contact with people who were infected.
On balance, though, he decided to leave because he believed China's healthcare services were struggling to cope. 
""On the off chance that we do get sick, I'd rather get sick in Canada,"" he said.

BAKU (Reuters) - Azerbaijan holds a snap parliamentary election on Sunday, seen as the next step by President Ilham Aliyev to consolidate power and create a younger, more dynamic parliament to push forward economic reforms.
Aliyev called the election in December, nine months before the vote was formally due. Officials from his ruling Yeni Azerbaijan party said the move was ""to support the president's policy on reforms and personnel changes.""
In October, Aliyev dismissed his influential chief-of-staff, Ramiz Mehdiyev, and made other high-profile changes including the appointment of 62-year-old economist Ali Asadov as prime minister.
The president criticized the pace of economic reforms and said he wanted to clear out government officials who had reached pensionable age, a move seen as intended to force out the old guard from the era of his father, Heydar Aliyev.
""I would call this an authoritarian modernization project,"" said Thomas de Waal, a Caucasus expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think-tank.
""Old Soviet-style bureaucrats are being pushed out and younger more professional figures are being given top jobs.""
Despite its energy resources, the South Caucasus country on the Caspian Sea struggles with unemployment, and many of the 10 million population see little benefit from the oil and gas it produces.
Sunday's election - while not a full democratic contest - will pit veteran lawmakers against young, Western-educated candidates from the same, ruling party in an effort to overhaul the legislature with more able technocrats, analysts say.
But any change will be resisted by the political old guard and wealthy oligarchs.
Voters will choose candidates for 125 seats in the single-chamber parliament, which is elected every five years through voting for individual candidates in electoral districts.
The opposition has accused the ruling Yeni Azerbaijan party of misusing government resources for the campaign.
""The election situation in the country does not correspond to the principles of democracy as the ruling party uses the executives for its own purposes,"" the opposition Musavat Party's leader, Arif Gajily, told Reuters.
A shake-up of the governing elite is not expected to bring any change in foreign policy. Azerbaijan is not aligned to any big regional grouping such as the European Union or the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union and its foreign policy is balanced between Russia, the West and Iran.
Aliyev has held power since he was elected in October 2003, two months before the death of his father who held power for a decade. Ilham Aliyev won elections in 2008, 2013 and 2018, and two separate referendums scrapped a two-term presidential limit and extended the presidential term to seven years from five.
He appointed his wife Mehriban Aliyeva first vice president, the second most powerful post after the president, in 2017.
Western nations have courted Azerbaijan because of its role as an alternative to Russia in supplying oil and gas to Europe, but various European bodies and rights groups have accused Aliyev of muzzling dissent and jailing opponents. Baku denies the accusations."

NAKHON RATCHASIMA, Thailand (Reuters) - A Thai soldier shot dead at least 20 people Saturday, posting messages on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as he went on the rampage in a northeastern city where he was still holed up in a mall nearly 12 hours after he first struck, authorities said.
Several bursts of automatic gunfire could be heard from inside the mall just after 2.40 a.m. (1940 GMT)
Thai security forces stormed the Terminal 21 mall in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima and helped hundreds of people to escape. Looking dazed and exhausted, shoppers and storeworkers came out in small groups into the early hours of Sunday as police and soldiers worked through the mall floor by floor.
""It was frightening because I could hear the occasional gunshot ... we waited a long time for the police to come and help us, many hours."" said Suvanarat Jirattanasakul, 27, her voice trembling after she emerged.
The soldier opened fire in several places, first at a house and then at an army base, before heading to the shopping mall in Nakhon Ratchasima, which is about 250 km (155 miles) from the capital Bangkok, police said.
Local media showed footage of the soldier getting out of a car in front of the mall and firing off a series of shots as people fled for cover.
""We don't know why he did this. It appears he went mad,"" Defence Ministry spokesman Kongcheep Tantrawanit told Reuters.
One video from a bystander showed a man slumped at the wheel of a car in a pool of blood. It was unclear if he was among the dead. Another video showed at least four people who had clearly been shot and showed no sign of movement.
CCTV footage from inside the mall posted on social media showed the gunman dressed in black and wearing a mask, his gun slung over his shoulder with no sign of other people around. 
Kongcheep said at least 20 people had been killed and it was not clear whether the gunman had taken hostages in the mall. 
""It's not known how many are still inside,"" said.
The health ministry said 31 people had been wounded and 10 were in a critical condition.
Police identified the suspect as Jakrapanth Thomma. During the attack he posted ""Death is inevitable for everyone"" on his Facebook page and later asked ""Should I give up?""
'WHY DID HE DO IT?'
Facebook said it had removed the suspect's account.
""Our hearts go out to the victims, their families and the community affected by this tragedy in Thailand. There is no place on Facebook for people who commit this kind of atrocity, nor do we allow people to praise or support this attack,"" a Facebook representative said in a statement.
Thai media said the suspect's mother was being taken to the mall to try to persuade him to give up. Video showed her in tears saying ""why did he do it?"" as she got in a police vehicle.
Major shootings are rare in the Southeast Asian country other than in the far south, where a decades-old insurgency persists.
The shooter first went to a house in the city and shot two people dead before going to an army base, where he took a gun from the weapons store and fired at people, local police said.
Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul asked on his Facebook page for blood donations at four hospitals in the area.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha expressed condolences to the families of those killed, a government spokeswoman said.
Nakhon Ratchasima is one of the biggest cities in northeastern Thailand, an island of relative prosperity in a rice growing area that is one of the poorest parts of the country of 69 million people.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Libya's warring parties will continue talks this month to try to reach a lasting ceasefire in a war for control of the capital Tripoli, the United Nations said on Saturday, after a first round in Geneva last week failed to yield an agreement.
The U.N. hosted indirect talks between five officers from the Libyan National Army (LNA) led by Khalifa Haftar, which has been trying to take Tripoli since April, and the same number from forces of the internationally recognized government in Tripoli.
Fighting has calmed down since last month although skirmishes with artillery have continued in southern Tripoli, which the LNA has been unable to breach in its campaign.
Both sides had agreed to continue the dialogue with the U.N. proposing a follow-up meeting on Feb. 18 in Geneva, the U.N. mission to Libya (UNSMIL) said in a statement.
It said the two sides wanted people displaced by the war to return but had been unable to agree on how to achieve this, without elaborating.
There was no immediate comment from either side in the conflict.
UNSMIL gave no update on efforts to end a blockade of major oil ports and oilfields by forces and tribesmen loyal to the LNA.
On Thursday, U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame said he had talked to tribesmen behind the blockade and was awaiting their demands.
He also said the blockade will be at the top of the agenda at a meeting in Cairo on Sunday between representatives from eastern, western and southern Libya seeking to overcome economic divisions in a country with two governments.
Diplomats said the Cairo meeting would be mainly attended by technical experts to prepare a wider dialogue to be followed in coming months.
In a sign that a reopening of ports might not be imminent, tribes and communities in oil-rich areas in eastern Libya held by the LNA said in a statement that they opposed resuming oil exports unless Tripoli is freed of militias, a demand of the LNA.
They also demanded the withdrawal of Syrian fighters sent by Turkey to help defend Tripoli against the LNA, which enjoys the backing of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Russian mercenaries.
Furthermore, they called for what they described as a fair distribution of oil revenues, another demand of the LNA and people in the east, where many complain of neglect going back to Muammar Gaddafi, toppled in a 2011 uprising which plunged Libya into chaos.
State oil firm NOC, which is based in Tripoli and serves the whole country, sends oil revenues to the central bank which mainly works with the Tripoli government, although it also pays some civil servants in the east."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday defended the ouster of impeachment witness Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman from the White House National Security Council, calling him ""insubordinate"" and saying he had incorrectly reported the contents of Trump's ""perfect"" telephone calls.
Vindman was one of two witnesses who provided some of the most damaging testimony during Trump's impeachment investigation who were ousted by the administration on Friday.
Trump tweeted that ""Fake News"" media kept ""talking about 'Lt. Col.' Vindman as though I should think only how wonderful he was.
""Actually, I don’t know him, never spoke to him, or met him (I don’t believe!) but, he was very insubordinate, reported contents of my 'perfect' calls incorrectly,"" Trump said.
Trump added that Vindman was ""given a horrendous report by his superior, the man he reported to, who publicly stated that Vindman had problems with judgment, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information. In other words, 'OUT'.""
Hours after Vindman was escorted from the White House on Friday, Gordon Sondland, another key impeachment witness, said he had been ousted from his post as U.S ambassador to the European Union. 
Vindman was among officials who listened to a July 25 call between Trump and Ukraine's president, Volodimir Zelenskiy. That conversation was at the center of the impeachment probe. Vindman testified that he went immediately to the NSC's chief lawyer to express concern about it.
Vindman's attorney, David Pressman, rejected the president's statements about his client as ""obviously false.""
""They conflict with the clear personnel record and the entirety of the impeachment record of which the President is well aware,"" he said in a statement.
""While the most powerful man in the world continues his campaign of intimidation, while too many entrusted with political office continue to remain silent, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman continues his service to our country as a decorated, active duty member of our military.""The Pentagon referred a request for comment on Trump's tweets to the Army, which repeated a statement from Friday that both Vindman and his brother had been reassigned to the Department of the Army.
""Out of respect for their privacy, we will not be providing any further information at this time,"" an Army spokesman said. 
Vindman's twin brother Yevgeny, who worked as a lawyer at the NSC and is also a lieutenant colonel, was also escorted out of the White House on Friday.

The Democratic-led House of Representatives impeached Trump, a Republican, on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over his dealings with Ukraine, but he was acquitted by the Republican-dominated Senate on Wednesday.

Turkey says the advances by Russian-backed Syrian troops and their allies threaten a fresh humanitarian disaster, driving another wave of potential refugees to its southern border, and has threatened to act if they do not pull back.
Witnesses at the border said convoys of Turkish military vehicles had been crossing into Idlib since Friday, delivering supplies before turning back to return with more.
The beefing up of Turkish forces has failed to stem the advance by Syrian government forces, which took control of a strategic town close to the provincial capital and also made gains to the east of Idlib - the last major enclave of opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
In Ankara, officials from Turkey and Russia held three hours of apparently inconclusive talks, agreeing to meet again next week. The two countries support opposing sides in Syria's nearly nine-year civil war, but have forged a series of agreements since 2017 aimed at containing the bloodshed. 
""The situation in Idlib was discussed,"" Turkey's foreign ministry said after the talks. ""Steps that could be taken to establish peace on the ground as soon as possible and advance the political process were evaluated.""
The escalation in Idlib has displaced around 600,000 people since the beginning of December, according to the United Nations, and disrupted the fragile cooperation between Russia and Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who backs some of the rebels who once aimed to topple Assad, threatened this week to repel the Russian-backed Syrian forces unless they withdraw from the region by the end of the month.
Syrian government forces have pressed their advances, surrounding several Turkish observation posts. On Monday, eight Turkish military personnel were killed in shelling by Syrian government forces. 
""Our checkpoints in Idlib continue their duties as usual and are capable of protecting themselves,"" Turkey's Defence Ministry said, adding they would respond to any new attack ""in the harshest manner in accordance with legitimate defense"".
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said on Saturday that 430 Turkish military vehicles had crossed into Idlib in the last 24 hours. 
Turkish forces were setting up a new post at Al-Mastoumah, on the southern approach to Idlib city, the Observatory said. 
Syrian state TV broadcast live on Saturday from the strategic town of Saraqeb, located at the junction of the two main highways in Idlib that Assad seeks full control of, and lies less than 10 miles (15 km) southeast of Idlib city.
It said the army had taken full control over the town.

The military media unit of the Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah, which supports Assad, said it had also taken control of Syrian government force had also taken the town of Al-Eis east of Idlib, close to the main north-south highway leading to Aleppo.

Aoun said he had a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron and the two would speak again in the next few days.

Prime Minister Hassan Diab's cabinet was formed last month with the support of the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement and its political allies, which hold a parliamentary majority. 
The government must contend with a liquidity crunch, shattered confidence in banks, a weakened Lebanese pound and soaring inflation.

The scandal has been particularly damaging for the CDU because the AfD branch in Thuringia is headed by Bjoern Hoecke, a militantly anti-immigrant figure who leads a radical wing within his party that is monitored by the domestic intelligence agency for possible unconstitutional activities.
A poll on Friday showed support for the CDU in Thuringia falling by some 10%.

The scandal has also weakened CDU national leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a protege of Chancellor Angela Merkel. Seen by many as Merkel's would-be successor, Kramp-Karrenbauer is struggling to assert her control over the conservative party after the Thuringia branch defied her and sided with the AfD.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy asked Pope Francis on Saturday for help to win the release of prisoners of war held by Russia and Russian-backed separatists.
""(The pope) does everything possible to achieve peace and harmony throughout the world,"" Zelenskiy said in a tweet after their meeting at the Vatican.
""I asked for help with the release of Ukrainians captured in Donbass, Crimea and Russia,"" he said.
Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and its subsequent support for separatists in a conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The Vatican has diplomatic relations with both Ukraine and Russia.
Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists in the east completed a large-scale prisoner swap on December 29 in the breakaway Donbass region. It is not clear how many Ukrainian government soldiers are still being held, but activists say there are about 100.
Zelenskiy won a landslide election victory in April, promising to end the five-year-old conflict and bring prisoners home.
The 42-year-old president, a former comedian, said he emerged from the meeting with the pope, who is nearly twice his age, ""inspired by our talk about peace in Ukraine"".
During the photo session of the meeting, which was open to reporters, Francis gave Zelenskiy a medal of St. Martin of Tours and said he hoped the saint ""will protect your people from war"".
A Vatican statement made no mention of what the pope and Zelenskiy spoke about in their private talks.

It said the president did discuss the conflict and its effects on the civilian population in separate talks later with the Vatican's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin and its foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher.

Turkey has backed rebels looking to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Iran and Russia have supported Assad’s forces in the war. The three countries have also collaborated on a political solution to the conflict.
In a meeting between the visiting United Nations' special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, and Iranian officials, Tehran underlined the importance of resolving issues in Syria through diplomacy, it said on its website.
""During the meeting, Iran reiterated that civilians in Syria should not be used as human shields ... and that Iran is ready to mediate between Turkey and Syria to solve the issue,"" the website reported.
Iranian state TV reported that Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, in a separate meeting with Pedersen in Tehran, said Iran was prepared to help in the de-escalation of the crisis in Syria with respect to Syria's independence and sovereignty.
Russian-backed Syrian forces have tried to capture Syria’s Idlib province, the last rebel stronghold in the country, displacing more than half a million people since early December.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has threatened to drive back the Syrian troops in Idlib unless they withdrew by the end of the month, after eight Turkish soldiers were killed on Monday by Syrian government shelling near the town of Saraqeb.

The election comes as India's economic growth is at its slowest in six years, and amid strong opposition to the law which makes it easier for non-Muslim persecuted minorities from three neighboring countries to become Indian citizens.
The law has stoked suspicion that Modi wants to turn secular India into a Hindu nation, something he rejects.
A poor showing in the capital this weekend could be another blow to Modi's Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after it lost control of Maharashtra state, whose capital is Mumbai, late last year.
Modi appealed to voters to exercise their franchise. ""Urging the people of Delhi, especially my young friends, to vote in record numbers,"" he wrote on Twitter. 
Polling is underway for 70 seats and the results will be announced on Feb. 11.
The contest to win New Delhi is between the BJP and incumbent Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's regional Aam Aadmi party (AAP).
AAP has highlighted its work over the last five years to fix state schools and healthcare in the city of more than 16 million people.
The BJP, however, has focused on the work of Modi’s federal government since its re-election last May, in particular changes that have appealed to the party's Hindu base such as reforms in the disputed Kashmir region and a court ruling, backed by the government, clearing the way for the construction of a Hindu temple on a long-disputed site in northern India.

Since coming to power in 2015, Poland's eurosceptic, nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party has introduced a series of judicial reforms that EU officials and democracy activists say may breach the bloc's standards on the rule of law. 
Its most recent reforms aim to discipline judges who question court appointments under new rules, introducing measures that critics say are designed to silence dissent. 
""This is no longer a targeted intervention against individual black sheep, similar to other EU member states, but a case of carpet bombing,"" Jourova told German weekly magazine Der Spiegel. 
""This is no reform, it's destruction.""
Her comments came as over a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of Poland's Constitutional Tribunal in Warsaw to support the reforms, arguing they are necessary to protect Poland's sovereignty.
Protesters carried Polish flags and placards saying ""EU's politicians, hands off Polish courts"" and ""We support the reform of courts."" A series of protests against the reforms have also taken place across Poland in recent months.
PiS says the reforms will make the court system more efficient and root out the leftovers of communism. Poland's President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, signed the most recent changes into law this week. 
Jourova said the Commission was scrutinizing the new law and keeping all legal options open.
She visited Poland in January and met with a number of Polish officials, including Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, Senate speaker and opposition member Tomasz Grodzki and Poland's Human Rights Commissioner Adam Bodnar.
During her visit, she expressed a willingness to enter into a dialogue with Poland's government. 

Her visit came after the European Commission said it was ""very concerned"" about the Polish changes to the judiciary.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran should increase its military might to prevent a war, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told a gathering of air force commanders on Saturday, dismissing the U.S. sanctions on the country as ""criminal act"".
""We should be strong to prevent any war against the county. Being weak will encourage our enemies to attack Iran,"" Khamenei, Iran's top authority, said according to state news agency IRNA.
The Islamic Republic has vowed to increase its military strength despite mounting pressure from Western countries to curtail its military capabilities, including its ballistic missile program. 
Tensions between Tehran and Washington have spiked since 2018 when U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 pact between Iran and world powers under which Tehran accepted curbs to its nuclear program in return for lifting sanctions.
""Since the revolution their aim was to stop us from having a strong military and a strong air force ... but look at us now. We even build planes. We have transformed their pressure to opportunity,"" Khamenei said, according to state TV. 
Iran is marking the 41st anniversary of the Islamic revolution, which toppled the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979. 
Washington has reimposed crippling sanctions aimed at halting all Iranian oil exports, saying it seeks to force Iran to negotiate to reach a wider deal. 
Khamenei, who dismissed the U.S. sanctions as a ""criminal act"", has banned Iranian officials from holding talks unless the United States returns to the deal and lifts all sanctions. He said Iran should distance its economy from dependency on oil exports.
Iran and the United States stormed to the edge of a war in early January when Tehran's most prominent general, Qassem Soleimani, was killed in a U.S. drone strike on his convoy in Baghdad.
Tehran responded by launching missile attacks on U.S. targets in Iraq. 

Iranian television said 80 ""American terrorists"" had been killed and U.S. helicopters and military equipment damaged, without providing any evidence, Washington denied that there were any fatalities.

1327,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2020 06:51AM ET</span>",Irish vote may end Varadkar's spell as PM as Sinn Fein surges,"By Padraic Halpin and Graham Fahy
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish voters look likely to dump Prime Minister Leo Varadkar from power on Saturday in an election that could alter the political landscape with a surge by Sinn Fein, which has struck a chord among younger voters.
The nationalist Sinn Fein party is unlikely to enter government, with opinion polls pointing to the main opposition Fianna Fail winning most seats and forming a coalition or minority government. 
Fianna Fail's policies on the economy and post-Brexit are broadly similar to those of Varadkar's center-right Fine Gael.
""I think there is a bit of a backlash coming (against Varadkar) from chatting to friends and colleagues,"" said Shane Sullivan, a 31-year-old data analyst who voted for Fianna Fail because he wanted a focus on public spending rather than tax cuts. ""I think they are just a bit out of touch to be honest.""
Left-wing Sinn Fein, which has moved on from the long leadership of Gerry Adams and is run by a new generation of politicians led by Mary Lou McDonald, could win the popular vote if the vote reflects the polls. On Monday, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was polling at 25%, ahead of Fianna Fail on 23% and Fine Gael on 20%.
But Sinn Fein, which has appealed to younger voters on the defining issue of the election - the cost and availability of housing - has put forward too few candidates to capitalize, as the groundswell of support caught the party itself off guard after it sunk to 9% at local elections last year.
Analysts say it may only be able to gain a few seats and retain its position as the third largest party in parliament.
While both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael insist they will not govern with Sinn Fein, citing its IRA past and differing economic polices, such an outcome would demonstrate an appetite for change in decades-long centrist Ireland.
The IRA fought against British rule in Northern Ireland in a 30-year conflict in which some 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace deal. Sinn Fein's ultimate aim is to unify Ireland and British-run Northern Ireland, where it shares power.
""I went for Sinn Fein this time because I really do believe it's time for change,"" said Siobhan Hogan, a 40-year-old childcare worker, who cited Fine Gael plans to increase the pension age and its failure to solve a housing crisis. 
""I'm lucky enough to have my own place but I look around and I see people struggling. People need a roof over their heads."" 
Polls close at 2200 GMT and will be followed by an exit poll giving the first indication of the result. Counting begins at 0900 GMT on Sunday with some results expected from the early afternoon. 
Varadkar had hoped the economic upturn his party has overseen since 2011 and his own diplomatic successes on Brexit - helping prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Britain's departure from the EU - would extend his near three-year premiership. 
The strategy appears to have fallen flat amid domestic issues such as healthcare and housing.

The immediate beneficiary looks set to be Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin, a 59-year-old former teacher whose party suffered an electoral collapse nine years ago after the government he was a member of had to seek an EU/IMF bailout.

1328,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",Weeding out fakes? Lisbon tourism at threat from 'drug' dealers,"By Victoria Waldersee and Catarina Demony
LISBON (Reuters) - Whispering ""Hashish? Cocaine?"", street sellers are offering unsuspecting tourists in Lisbon's center ""drugs"" which police say are often bay leaves, flour or ground paracetamol.
Locals in Lisbon's historic Santa Maria Maior district say the fake drugs phenomenon is getting worse, worrying police and business owners who fear tourists could start to steer clear of the Portuguese capital's bustling center.
""Everyone on my tours gets asked if they want drugs,"" Maarten, a Belgian tour guide working in Lisbon, said. ""Some just laugh, but others don't like it at all.""
Portugal, which has long been popular for its beaches, historic sites and golf courses, has become reliant on tourism in recent years after government and businesses looked to it to drive growth after the 2011-14 debt crisis.
Preliminary figures released at the end of last year showed Portugal welcomed a record of 26 million tourists in 2019, with around a third visiting Lisbon. Data from the World Travel and Tourism Council showed that the total contribution of travel and tourism to Portugal's GDP reached 19.1% in 2018.
Drugs are not a new problem for the country, which decriminalized possession and consumption of a limited amount of drugs in 2001 after decades of high rates of heroin addiction.
But while selling drugs is illegal, selling bay leaf or flour is not. At best, it is a breach of street licensing laws.
Bruno Pereira, police commissioner for Lisbon's criminal investigation department, said that new legislation was needed to tackle the problem, which requires ""continuous attention"".
""Tourists are unaware of this phenomenon so they are fooled,"" Pereira said. Police say vendors make a steep profit by showing potential buyers a real drug sample to smell or taste and once they have paid, handing them a fake substitute.
""Tourists complain every week that they've been ripped off outside our bar,"" a bartender in the main party street said.
Local business owners, who like Maarten want to remain anonymous in case of a backlash from dealers, are worried. 
Tourists sometimes come into bars saying they are hiding from dealers, one bar owner said. Police said that on occasion dealers get aggressive if a potential buyer is not interested.

Police launched a series of posters in 2016 and still on display featuring tongue-in-cheek slogans like ""Need some seasoning? There's cheaper bay leaf in the grocery store. Don't buy fake drugs!""

""We just need change in Ireland, it's very obvious,"" said Eilis Wall, a 40-year-old preschool owner who traveled 200 km (125 miles)to Dublin from the western county of Clare on Wednesday to join thousands of childcare workers calling for better state funding.
""Fine Gael have really let us down and Fianna Fail were worse before that. I'm voting for change,"" she said, adding that meant switching to Sinn Fein from Fine Gael.
Wall said she plans to change careers away from childcare because she cannot save for a pension - the sort of economic worry affecting large swathes of voters who feel left behind amid a boom that has made Ireland's economy the fastest growing in the European Union for six straight years.
Varadkar had hoped the upturn his party has overseen since 2011 and his own diplomatic successes so far on Brexit - helping prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Britain's departure from the EU - would extend his near three-year premiership.

""The gains Sinn Fein are making are consistent with what we're seeing in other democracies."""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Nicaragua's government on Friday released a shipment of impounded ink and paper belonging to La Prensa newspaper, which has been critical of leftist President Daniel Ortega, one of the owners said.
The United States welcomed the release of the ink and paper seized in October 2018. Washington has imposed sanctions on it for human rights violations following a wave of anti-government protests in 2018, and urged Managua to ease restrictions on other organizations.
La Prensa is Nicaragua's biggest newspaper and has been a thorn in the side of Ortega, repeatedly referring to him as the ""dictator"" in the wake of the protests that were crushed by the security forces. About 326 people died in the unrest.
The government of Ortega, whose family presides over a vast media empire, has cracked down on independent news outlets. As well as impounding La Prensa's shipment of ink and paper, Nicaraguan police also raided and shuttered two television channels.
La Prensa, Nicaragua's only national newspaper, has been forced to reduce the number of pages it prints, which cut its advertising revenue and forced it to lay off many journalists.
Jaime Chamorro, whose family owns La Prensa, told Reuters that a channel of communication was opened with the customs department and it ""freed our supplies that were detained.""
Michael Kozak, the Acting Assistant Secretary for the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said on Twitter that ""the long-overdue decision to release @laprensa’s paper & ink from Nicaraguan customs is a step in the right direction.""

(Reuters) - The two engines of the helicopter that crashed in hazy, cloudy weather on a California hillside last month, killing basketball great Kobe Bryant and eight others, showed no evidence of a ""catastrophic internal failure,"" federal investigators said on Friday.
The interim report issued by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 12 days after the Jan. 26 accident also said examination of both rotor assemblies found damage ""consistent with powered rotation at the time of impact.""
The findings, while preliminary, pointed to no obvious signs of mechanical problems that may have contributed to the fiery crash in which Bryant, 41, his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and all seven others aboard the helicopter perished.
The death of Bryant, an 18-time all-star in the National Basketball Association and one of the world's most admired sports figures, prompted an outpouring of shock and grief from fans and fellow athletes around the globe.
The retired Los Angeles Lakers forward had been on his way to a youth basketball tournament in which he was coaching and his daughter and two other girls aboard the luxury chopper were due to compete. 
In one key new disclosure about the crash, the NTSB investigative update said: ""viewable sections of the engines showed no evidence of an uncontained or catastrophic internal failure."" 
The 11-page report did not rule out that mechanical issues might yet be identified when the engines and other parts recovered from the wreckage of the Sikorsky S-76B are disassembled and more closely examined.
MIST AND CLOUDS
NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy said two days after the tragedy that clouds, fog and limited visibility reported in the vicinity of the crash would be a key focus of the investigation.
Friday's report said videos and photographs taken by the public in the area depict fog and low clouds obscuring the hilltops around the crash site, including security video footage showing the helicopter disappearing into clouds moments before it went down.
The NTSB also quoted a witness from a mountain bike trail in foothills surrounded by mist who recounted briefly glimpsing the helicopter emerging from clouds as it rolled to the left before crashing seconds later a short distance away from him.
The pilot, an experienced aviator certified as an instructor, was navigating by visual orientation, not by instrument guidance, during the entirety of the ill-fated flight, the NTSB said. 
While he was licensed to fly by instruments, the charter company that owned the chopper, Island Express Helicopters, was only permitted to fly by visual flight rules when carrying paying passengers, the report said.
Robert Clifford, a Chicago-based aviation disaster lawyer, said flying a helicopter in low visibility is ill-advised without two pilots, even if navigating by instruments.
""An experienced but nevertheless single pilot in bad weather is a bad formula for the safe operation of a helicopter,"" he told Reuters.
Shortly before radar contact with Bryant's helicopter was lost, the pilot had told air traffic control he was trying to climb above a cloud layer, the NTSB said. 
Moments later the aircraft banked to the left and began to descend, slamming into the ground at more 45 miles per hour (72 kph) and bursting into flames. ""The entire fuselage/cabin and both engines were subjected to a post-crash fire,"" the report said.
The wreckage, strewn about an impact crater, was found in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains near the town of Calabasas, about 40 miles (64 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

The agency said the conclusions it reaches on the cause of the crash and contributing factors will be published in its final report, which is expected in 12 to 18 months.

The death of Li Wenliang, 34, came as President Xi Jinping reassured the United States and the World Health Organization (WHO) of transparency and maximum effort to combat the virus.

Beijing's communist leadership has sealed off cities, cancelled flights and closed factories to limit an epidemic roiling the world's second biggest economy to the alarm of global markets and businesses dependent on Chinese supply lines. 
The epicentre region of Hubei is in lockdown and the capital Beijing resembles a ghost town.
Deaths in mainland China reached 637 on Friday, with a total of 31,211 cases, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva, warning of a worldwide shortage of gowns, masks and other protective equipment.
""For the last two days there had been fewer reported infections in China, which is good news, but we caution against reading too much into that,"" he told the WHO Executive Board.
""The numbers could go up again.""
Virus concerns swiped world markets on Friday, but failed to stand in the way of the best week for stocks since June and the strongest for the dollar since August.
With Chinese buyers rejecting shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) due to the epidemic, traders rushed to find alternative locations amid record low prices.
U.S. President Donald Trump, after speaking to Xi by phone, said China was showing ""great discipline"".
""Nothing is easy, but he will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm & the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone,"" Trump said on Twitter. 
OPTHALMOLOGIST REBUKED 
Ophthalmologist Li was among eight people reprimanded by police in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, for spreading ""illegal and false"" information.
His social media warnings of a new ""SARS-like"" coronavirus - a reference to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed almost 800 people around the world in 2002-2003 after originating in China - angered police.
China was accused of trying to cover up SARS.
Li was made to sign a letter on Jan. 3, saying he had ""severely disrupted social order"" and was threatened with charges. 
Social media users called him a hero and shared a selfie of him lying on a hospital bed wearing an oxygen respirator and holding up his Chinese identification card. One image showed the message ""farewell Li Wenliang"" etched into snow on a riverbank.
""Wuhan indeed owes Li Wenliang an apology,"" said Hu Xijin, editor of the government-backed Global Times tabloid. 
Rights group Amnesty International called his death a ""tragic reminder"" of how China's preoccupation with stability made it suppress vital information. 
There were signs discussion of his death was being censored.
After briefly trending on Weibo, the topics ""the Wuhan government owes doctor Li Wenliang an apology"" and ""we want free speech"" yielded no search results.
""UNACCEPTABLE STIGMA"" 
The virus has spread around the world, with 320 cases now in 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, a Reuters tally of official statements shows.
WHO emergency expert Mike Ryan called out stigma being attached to the virus amid reports of Asians being shunned in the West. ""The unnecessary, unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity is utterly and completely unacceptable and it needs to stop,"" he said.
The outbreak could have spread from bats to humans via illegal traffic of pangolins, the world's only scaly mammals, Chinese researchers said, sparking some scepticism.
Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China, in Hong Kong and the Philippines, but how deadly and contagious the virus is remains unclear, prompting countries to quarantine hundreds of people and cut travel links with China. 
There were 41 new cases among about 3,700 people quarantined in a cruise ship off Japan, taking the total to 61. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong quarantined for a third day a cruise ship with 3,600 on board.
And about two dozen sick passengers aboard a cruise ship that arrived off New Jersey in the United States were screened for the coronavirus, with four sent to a local hospital out of ""an abundance of caution,"" the local mayor said. 
The head of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice, Li Fuying, told reporters that people deliberately concealing contacts or refusing isolation could be punished with death.

AMMAN/ANKARA (Reuters) - Wary of a confrontation with Turkey that could suck Moscow into a military quagmire, Russia is likely to take a gradual approach to helping the Syrian government capture the last rebel bastion of Idlib, analysts and diplomats say.
President Bashar al-Assad's army, aided by heavy Russian air strikes, has swept through dozens of towns in Idlib province in the last two weeks in the deepest advance in years, forcing tens of thousands to flee to the Turkish border. 
But Russia is unlikely to lend its military muscle for a full-on advance on densely populated Idlib city.
Such a push would help Assad regain full control of Syria, which he and his late father before him ruled for a total of nearly 50 years, but it would also risk a major confrontation with Turkey, which backs opposition forces in the war. 
Instead, Russia appears intent on ""biting"" chunks of rebel turf in a piece by piece approach, a senior Western intelligence source told Reuters, 
Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, has threatened military action if Assad's forces do not retreat by the end of the month and has reinforced Turkish outposts in the region and set up new ones to try to slow the advance.
""The regime has come very close to Idlib (city),"" a Turkish official told Reuters. ""The rules of engagement in Syria changed, a new era has started now.""
The crackle of gunfire can now be heard by the more than a million inhabitants living in the city, many of them Syrians displaced by government assaults on their territory.
""People everywhere are terrified, people are sleeping in the streets and cars, there is no place to stay,"" Ibrahim Samaan al Hajj, a grocer in the city said.
INEVITABLE FIGHT
Officials from Turkey and Russia are due to discuss the offensive on Saturday as tensions rise after eight Turkish soldiers were killed in Syrian shelling on one outpost, prompting Turkish troops to respond.
A costly battle for the provincial capital does not appear to be Moscow's priority.
""Russia is concerned with opening major highways that are symbols of sovereignty for the regime,"" said Syrian military defector general Ahmad Rahhal. ""Falling in the Idlib (city) quagmire is very costly militarily and a humanitarian catastrophe with one million people inside the city.""
Moscow will be the one to decide if and when to move on Idlib city at some stage, a step that risks unleashing a bloodbath and deepening the humanitarian crisis, opposition military commanders and Western intelligence sources said.
Syrian ground troops aided by Iranian-backed militias coming from Aleppo are now on the fringes of Idlib city after taking Maarat al-Numan and Saraqeb near the strategic M4-M5 road Aleppo to Hama and Latakia on the Mediterranean coast.
""For the time being it's important that they control the highway, and I think it's an accommodation they can reach with Turkey,"" said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli of the German Marshall Fund. 
He said the takeover on Idlib city is a ""matter of time but we are not there yet"" because the Syrian army is overstretched.
The battle for Idlib is a crucial stage of a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of combatants and civilians, made millions refugees in their own country or overseas, and fractured the wider Middle East since it broke out in 2011.
""RED LINE""
The fate of the region has been the focus of Russia-Turkey deals involving Iran since 2017 aimed at sparing its three million inhabitants all out war.
Turkish officials said the new advance imperils understandings under a 2018 pact that left Turkey, which has expanded its influence in Syria, to secure control of rebel-controlled highways and handle the thorny fate of jihadists. Moscow accuses Ankara of failing to live up to its obligations.
At a recent meeting with some 40 Turkey-backed rebel commanders held in Reyhanli along the border, Turkish intelligence told rebels that talks with Moscow had failed and to prepare for the worst, a source who attended the gathering told Reuters, adding that Idlib city was ""a red line"". 
The city has been mostly spared the aerial bombing of the latest two-month old campaign that has triggered the exodus of nearly 600,000 people from areas further south and east.
Western military experts said Moscow has used a ""scorched earth"" aerial bombing maneuver that has hit hospitals, schools and other infrastructure in mostly rural areas of the province. But such tactics could prove more difficult to use in the city.

""If there is going to be a battle in Idlib, there will be a bloodbath, the jihadists will fight with all their strength and we will see more suicide operations,"" Abu Baraa al-Shami, a nom de guerre of a senior commander with Hayat Tahir al Sham, told Reuters in a text message via Internet messaging.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, reeling from severe earthquakes last month and still struggling to recover from devastating hurricanes in 2017, would get nearly $4.7 billion in new aid under legislation passed on Friday by the House of Representatives.
The Democratic-controlled House, by a vote of 237-161, approved the bill that also contains tax breaks for the bankrupt Caribbean island and its 3.2 million people, who are American citizens.
It is unclear whether the Republican-controlled Senate will consider the measure.
The legislation was crafted after a 6.4 magnitude earthquake rocked Puerto Rico on Jan. 7, followed by another of 5.2 magnitude just days later.
Democrats ignored a White House veto threat issued on Wednesday that cited ""waste, fraud and abuse"" in previously ""misallocated"" emergency aid.
""President Trump has turned his back on the island. This Congress must not do the same,"" House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey said during House debate on the bill.
An Appropriations Committee aide said the Trump administration is holding up $1.9 billion in electrical grid aid and $6.5 billion in other federal assistance that previously was enacted into law.
There have been long-running tensions between President Donald Trump and Puerto Rico since two major hurricanes damaged the island in September 2017.
Trump has called Puerto Rico ""one of the most corrupt places on earth."" During a brief post-hurricane visit in 2017 he tossed paper towels into a crowd gathered at a disaster-relief distribution center, as hospitals lacked emergency generators, water was scarce and the antiquated power grid was mostly destroyed.
The House-passed measure includes $3.26 billion in federal community development grants, $1.25 billion to repair damaged roads, $100 million to bring schools back to working order, $40 million in nutrition assistance and about $20 million to address energy needs.
It would also expand child tax credits for Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories and increase a low-income housing credit. Other tax provisions aim to spark private investment in low-income communities.
It also expands tax breaks for Puerto Rico's rum industry, dominated by Bacardi Limited, the largest privately held spirits firm in the world.
The top Republican on the Appropriations Committee said the tax breaks were unnecessary.
As for the $4.7 billion in new aid, Representative Kay Granger said: ""Much of that is for disasters that haven't happened yet."""
1340,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 12:18PM ET</span>",Palestinian protester killed in unrest over U.S. Mideast plan,"By Stephen Farrell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A Palestinian protester was shot dead in the West Bank on Friday as Palestinian and U.S. leaders blamed each other for violence that erupted after President Donald Trump unveiled a Middle East Peace plan that Palestinians rejected as one sided.
Palestinian protesters and Israeli security forces have repeatedly clashed since the peace proposals were unveiled by Trump, with Israel's prime minister at his side.
Friday's killing raised the Palestinian death toll to four. Israelis have been wounded.
On Friday, mourners had gathered in the occupied West Bank for the funeral of a Palestinian police officer who was shot dead in the unrest a day earlier. Palestinian authorities said he was killed by Israeli gunfire. Israel has not commented.
There were sporadic clashes between protesters and Israeli security forces near Azzun, where the funeral was held.
Palestinians also clashed with Israeli troops in Jericho and burned tyres in the West Bank village of Bil'in.
Palestinian medics said one protester had been shot and killed near Tulkarm on Friday.
The Israeli army said dozens of Palestinian rioters had hurled rocks and fire bombs at troops, and soldiers had identified a Palestinian who threw a firebomb and ""responded with fire in order to remove the threat.""
""The Palestinian people will not allow the 'Deal of the Century' to pass,"" said Mohammed Barakeh, waving a Palestinian flag in Bil'in, referring to the U.S. peace deal.
""They are fighting for their national character and the independence of their country,"" said Barakeh, a former Israeli lawmaker and member of Israel's 21% Arab minority, many of whom identify with Palestinian brethren in the West Bank and Gaza.
President Mahmoud Abbas's Palestinian Authority has rejected Trump's peace plan, which would give Israel most of what it has sought during decades of conflict, including the disputed holy city of Jerusalem and nearly all the occupied land on which it has built settlements.
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Washington was to blame for the unrest since the plan was unveiled.
""Those who introduce plans for annexation and the legalizing of occupation and settlements are really responsible for deepening violence and counter-violence,"" he said.
He said Abbas would go to the U.N. Security Council with ""a genuine peace plan"".
Trump's senior adviser Jared Kushner, the main architect of the U.S. plan, has denounced the Palestinian leadership, breaking from decades of diplomacy when Washington sought to appear neutral. On Thursday, he blamed Abbas for the violence.
""I think he does have responsibility,"" Kushner said after briefing U.N. Security Council ambassadors. ""He calls for days of rage in response, and he said that before he even saw the plan.""
Israeli police said security chiefs had met on Thursday and would increase security ""across the country, with emphasis on Jerusalem"".
Palestinians have long boycotted relations with the Trump administration, which they view as biased. Washington says its plan offers a path toward a Palestinian state, and blames the Palestinian leadership for chasing unrealistic goals.

Twitter disabled the tweet function on Vox's official account in Spain more than two weeks ago, after - in an apparent reference to a gender equality program for schoolchildren - the account sent out a post accusing the governing Socialists of using public money to encourage paedophilia.
""The attitude of Twitter is violating basic rights such as freedom of expression, the right to political participation, ideological freedom and the principle of political pluralism and equality,"" the party said in a statement.
It said it had asked the judge to lift the tweet ban while the court decides on whether it will hear the case.
The court challenge is the latest in a spate of legal confrontations between tech companies and far-right groups globally, as social media platforms seek to crack down on hate speech and the groups argues their views are being discriminated against.
In a statement sent after the Vox account was restricted, a spokeswoman for Twitter said the post had violated the company's norms. Vox had been notified of the offensive tweet and told that certain functions on its account would be limited until the tweet was deleted.
Twitter said on Friday it had nothing to add to its previous statement.
Vox also disputed Twitter's characterization of its tweet as hate speech, adding the court challenge included an accusation of slander.
Vox, which is anti-feminist and seeks to curtail the rights of the LGBT community, surged in the November election to become the third-largest party in Spain's parliament."

Bartosz Staszewski, a 29-year-old filmmaker, has taken portraits of five people so far, and plans another 32 that would target towns he considers took the strongest stance against the gay community.
His action is in protest against what he calls a ""hate campaign"" by Poland's ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), which says lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) ""ideology"" is an invasive foreign influence that undermines traditional values in the staunchly Catholic country.
In Poland, which doesn't recognize any form of same-sex union, parades to celebrate LGBT life became violent flashpoints last year in the buildup to October elections. [nL3N26B2VT]
The self-funded artistic project, which is published on social media, involves Staszewski photographing local members of the LGBT community in front of a sign saying ""LGBT-free zone"" in four languages. He removes the sign after each photoshoot.
""I'm visualizing, encouraging a debate,"" Staszewski told Reuters, as he prepared to photograph Jakub Przybysz, 26, a former resident of the eastern Polish town of Trzebieszow and a gay man.
Miroslaw Szekalis, the mayor of Trzebieszow, where a motion to reject ""LGBT ideology"" was passed last year, defended the town's decision. ""Neither I, nor any of the council members ... have a reason to be ashamed,"" he told Reuters.
While the motions are largely symbolic, they can be intimidating for members of the LGBT community. Municipalities and regions that have rejected LGBT ""ideology"" cover nearly a third of the country.
When Staszewski first published the pictures on social media, some members of the European Parliament and a Polish presidential candidate, Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska, criticized the signs which they thought had been put up by towns.
""False accusations appearing in the EU institutions directed at the Polish government create a false picture,"" PiS members in the European Parliament said in a statement on Thursday. They did not mention Staszewski's project specifically.
Staszewski, who has been accused of spreading fake news and received threats on social media, changed the captions accompanying his pictures to explain the project better.
""I thought ... we live in such a time that people will understand that this is an art project,"" he said. ""(But) we are living in a time when there is a thin line between what is absurd and what is reality."""

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain is depriving its poor of basic rights, even as its businesses recover from the economic crisis, a U.N. poverty expert said on Friday.
The country is facing housing problems of ""stunning proportions"" that are hitting people already struggling without jobs and sufficient benefits, said the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, Philip Alston in a report.
Spain's Ministry of Social Rights and the Secretary of State for Communication did not immediately respond to requests for a response. Its Ministry for Transport, Mobility, and Urban Planning directed calls to its housing department which did not answer.
His preliminary findings https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25524&LangID=E from a two-week tour of Spain came out as Madrid’s new Socialist-led leftist coalition government completed its first month in office.
It has vowed to improve social spending and has raised the minimum wage by 5.5% - but Alston warned of ""a deep mismatch between the needs and the policy responses being considered,"" especially on housing.
In 2008-2014, Spain suffered one of the longest and most painful economic crises in Europe, sending unemployment shooting up to 27% and prompting large public spending cuts.
Its solid economic recovery since then has heavily favored corporations and the wealthy, but never restored social protections, Alston said.
""The post-recession recovery that has been so good for some has left many people behind, and that all too little has been done for most members of that large group,"" his report said.
It denounced: ""Deep widespread poverty and high unemployment, a housing crisis of stunning proportions, a completely inadequate social protection system that leaves large numbers of people in poverty by design.
""Despite the clear need, low cost rental housing is almost nonexistent in Spain,"" he said citing data from the Housing Europe network of housing providers that show just 2.5% of Spain's occupied stock is social, compared with nearly 17% in France and 30% in the Netherlands.
In Honrubia 9, a former council block in a humble Madrid neighborhood which authorities sold to international investment fund Blackstone (NYSE:BX), residents said they were worried they would be evicted.
""When I asked for social housing, (Madrid council) told me there was a lot of demand and very little availability,"" said one tenant.
Alston's assessments of developing and industrialized countries have angered several governments in the past, including in the United States and Britain. (https://reut.rs/2ujabsV)"

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's would-be successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, struggled to assert her control over her conservative party on Friday after a regional branch defied her by backing a local leader helped into office by the far right.
The local branch of Kramp-Karrenbauer's Christian Democrats (CDU) in the eastern state of Thuringia sided with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) this week in a secret ballot to oust a leftist as state premier.
That move, which saw Thomas Kemmerich of the pro-business FDP become the first state premier to get into power with the support of the AfD, shattered a post-war consensus among established parties to shun the far right.
Merkel and Kramp-Karrenbauer have both denounced the move and say it was taken in defiance of the party's central leadership.
""The CDU in Thuringia supported this candidate, against the clear recommendation of the federal party ... although it should have been clear to everyone that it was an opportunity for the AfD to play games,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer said on Friday.
She also blamed the left for seeking to keep its candidate in power without a majority, and the FDP for putting up its candidate in the first place.
Kramp-Karrenbauer has called for new elections to be held in Thuringia. But the regional branch of the CDU has remained defiant, saying state party leaders had decided it was best to resolve the situation without a new vote. The CDU's popularity in Thuringia has fallen, making any new election risky.
The party leader's apparent inability to bring the regional branch to heel drew fire in the German press.
""Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who absolutely wants to become chancellor, has shown that her authority and leadership are not even sufficient to tame the CDU regional chapter in Thuringia,"" the conservative Bild newspaper wrote in a commentary.
Lars Klingbeil, secretary general of the Social Democrats, Merkel's junior coalition party, on Thursday accused the CDU of showing no capacity for crisis management, and suggested Kramp-Karrenbauer knew in advance about the Thuringia plans.
""They deliberately ran into this situation. Thuringia's CDU accepted this situation, with Kramp-Karrenbauer's knowledge,"" he said.
Kramp-Karrenbauer, 57, won a vote in December 2018 to succeed Merkel as party leader, but has since struggled to impose discipline. Last year she told delegates at a party conference to back her vision for Germany, or else ""let's end it here and now"".
As she struggles to assert herself, Kramp-Karrenbauer's erstwhile rivals for the party leadership - Friedrich Merz and Jens Spahn - are circling with intent.

Businessman Merz has quit asset manager Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) to focus more on politics and Spahn, now health minister, has cut a dynamic figure during the coronavirus crisis, jetting to Paris and London to coordinate the European and G7 response.

Officials said armed groups had stepped up assaults in Cabo Delgado province, the center of an Islamist insurgency that has killed hundreds since it started in 2017.
The northern region is also home to one of the world's biggest recent gas finds, where  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), Total and others are working.
Displaced villagers have described killings, maiming, torture and destroyed crops, Andrej Mahecic, the spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said.
""They speak of men in particular being targeted and beheaded, and many, many reports of women and children ... being kidnapped or simply disappearing,"" he told a briefing in Geneva.
Some of the attackers appeared to be bandits. ""But there is also the element of some of the groups being driven by ideological or other ideas. And they have been quite vicious ... in spreading the terror in this part of Mozambique,"" Mahecic added.
The UNHCR said there had been a sharp increase in violence in recent months, and the past weeks had been the most turbulent period since attacks began in October 2017. In all, 100,000 people have been uprooted by the violence in the last two years. 
""In total, at least 28 attacks were carried out in the province since the beginning of the year,"" Mahecic said. 
The militants - who tout their brand of Islam as an antidote to what they describe as a corrupt ruling elite - called themselves Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama when they started launching attacks in 2017. 

More recently, Islamic State has claimed responsibility via its media outlets, though there has been no independent confirmation of a link.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia's regional leader Quim Torra told Reuters on Friday that he wants to agree on a date for an independence referendum as part of talks with the Spanish government, arguing that the region's path towards secession is ""irreversible"".
Catalonia has been a dominant theme in Spanish politics since it briefly declared independence in October 2017 following a referendum deemed illegal by courts, prompting the country's biggest political crisis in decades. 
Torra met on Thursday with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who rejects any move towards independence but agreed to hold talks with Catalonia's leaders to discuss the future of the wealthy northeastern region.
""We will be independent,"" Torra said in an interview at his 15th century regional government palace in Barcelona. He would not discuss a target date but said: ""I am confident that the independence of Catalonia is absolutely irreversible.""
Madrid has ruled out any independence referendum or amnesty for Catalan separatist leaders who were sentenced to jail or left the country after the botched independence declaration. 
But Torra said he wants to discuss a date for an independence referendum and get results on both issues at a meeting later this month with the Spanish government, which Sanchez and he would chair. 
""GO TO ROOTS OF CONFLICT""
Torra, who considers Sanchez should attend all the negotiation meetings, said the longstanding Catalan issue was not frozen but a ""hot conflict"".
""Let's talk on how we solve the roots of the conflict ... that means to let the Catalan people decide their own future democratically and peacefully,"" he said.
Talks between Madrid and the Catalan government were a condition set out by left-wing separatists from the Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) party, who were instrumental in facilitating Sanchez's confirmation as prime minister last month.
The growing division among the two main separatist parties that rule the region - Torra's centre-right Junts per Catalunya and ERC - prompted Torra to announce a snap regional election last month. The earliest it can be is May. [
Torra said he will give a date for the vote the day after the Catalan budget is approved by the regional parliament. 
He did not rule out the election being after the summer, which could benefit his party as it lacks a candidate and trailed ERC in recent votes. 
Torra's own future is uncertain after over a year in office. He was sentenced in December to an 18-month ban from public office for refusing to remove symbols supporting jailed Catalan activists from government buildings and is awaiting an appeal. 

Catalonia saw sometimes violent protests in October after nine separatist leaders were handed lengthy prison sentences.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Hubei province, the coronavirus outbreak epicentre, has started using a faster and more convenient method of testing in order to isolate patients more quickly, the official People's Daily reported on Friday.
Reuters reported last month that a lack of RNA test kits in Hubei capital Wuhan may have delayed patients from being properly diagnosed and treated, contributing to the spread of the virus in the early days of the outbreak.
Hubei will start recognising computerized tomography (CT) scan results as confirmation of suspected infections of the coronavirus, which has killed over 600 people in China, the newspaper said on its official Weibo account, citing a document published by the National Health Commission on Feb. 5.
The move could significantly shorten testing time and allow more prompt treatment in the province, doctors and epidemiologists said. Previously, China's health authorities had a stricter rule for identifying such cases, and patients were often denied access to be treated full-time without RNA tests that could take days to process.
""The biggest advantage of CT scans is 'fast' – we can see the results immediately,"" Qi Xiaolong, Professor of Medicine and Assistant Dean at the First Hospital of Lanzhou University, said in an email to Reuters.
""As we're facing the shortage of virus test-kits in Wuhan and other virus-stricken areas near it (or the shortage of professional testing staff), current case-confirming procedures cannot meet the requirement of diagnosis and treatment,"" he said, adding the quality of reagents and proficiency in sample retention could also affect the accuracy of the test results.
In contrast, CT scan results have proven highly reliable and can yield results in just minutes, Cheng Zhenshun, Director of the department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, said earlier this week.
""We've finally seen this change happen,"" a Wuhan Weibo user surnamed Zhang wrote in a post commenting on the news. ""This will give patients a lot more confidence."""
1349,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>","Amid arms race, Macron offers Europe French nuclear wargames insight","By Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron on Friday offered to open a ""strategic dialogue"" with willing European partners about the role of French nuclear deterrence policy in continental security, calling for a ""surge"" in European defense spending and resolve.
The overture to Europeans chimes with Macron's insistence that Europe should reinforce its strategic autonomy in the face of growing global threats and stop relying solely on the United States and the transatlantic alliance for its defense. 
In a much-anticipated speech on French nuclear deterrence, a ritual for every French president under the Fifth Republic, Macron said that European nations who wanted to do so, could be associated with French nuclear deterrence wargames.
""France's vital interests now have a European dimension,"" Macron told the future elite of French armed forces at Paris' Ecole de Guerre.
""European partners who want to do so will be able to be associated to French deterrence forces' wargames,"" he said.
Elysee officials did not elaborate on what form this association could take, but said this did not mean ""sharing"" French deterrence but ""talking about it and deepening Europeans' joint strategic culture.""
The French leader, who refused to place the French nuclear deterrent under EU or NATO command, as suggested recently by a German lawmaker, also reaffirmed that Brexit would not change anything regarding France's nuclear co-operation with Britain. 
France, the EU's only nuclear power since Britain left the bloc, has long prided itself in its independent deterrent, built by World War Two hero Charles de Gaulle and confirmed by French presidents ever since. 
Paris spends about 3.5 billion euros ($4 billion) annually on maintaining its stockpile of about 300 submarine-launched and air-launched nuclear weapons. It plans to spend 5 billion euros a year by 2020 on modernizing its nuclear weapons capacity. 
It put an end to nuclear weapons testing in 1996 after a test in the South Pacific sparked global outrage.
The criticism was especially fierce in Germany, where anti-nuclear sentiment is strong and the U.S. nuclear umbrella is considered a cornerstone of security.
""The issue is not for Europeans to know whether they must defend themselves with or without Washington,"" Macron said. ""But our security derives also, inevitably, from a greater capacity by Europeans to act autonomously.""
He added that European freedom could only come from ""economic and digital sovereignty"", citing 5G and cloud computing as systemic ""nerve centers"":

""To build the Europe of tomorrow, our norms can't be under American control. Our infrastructures, our ports and airports can't be controlled by Chinese capital, neither can our digital networks be under Russian pressure,"" Macron said.

LUCKNOW (Reuters) - U.S. and European defense firms backed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's military modernization drive at a defense exhibition on Friday, despite a lengthy procurement process running into years and limited funds. 
Airbus SE and U.S.-based  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. are eying multi-billion dollar deals under Modi's aim to upgrade an aging fleet of aircraft and enhance local arms manufacturing to cut imports.
""I feel encouraged overall,"" Anand Stanley, President and managing director of Airbus India and South Asia, told Reuters.
""Every year the government is doing capital allocation. They are spending,"" he said.
The military is also looking to buy submarines, warships and battlefield communication systems. But these have made little headway.
Airbus is offering to set up an assembly line in India in partnership with the Tata Group to produce the C295W military transport aircraft as a replacement for Indian Air Force's Avro fleet.
The 120 billion rupee Avro replacement program has been in the pipeline for almost a decade.
Airbus on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with India's Adani Aerospace and Defense, part of the diversified Adani Group, for aircraft services in India and South Asia.
Boeing, which has pitched its F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet fighter for the India air force and navy and is competing with Lockheed Martin's F-21, said it plans to push India's armed forces' drive for modernization through a suite of five products - the Super Hornet, KC-46 tanker, P-8I aircraft, AH-64E Apache (NYSE:APA) and CH-47(I) Chinook helicopters.
The company said it wants to build a global defense and aerospace ecosystem ""that creates jobs and industrial capacity with Make in India,"" said Salil Gupte, president, Boeing India in a statement during the exhibition.
Boeing and Lockheed will be competing with Sweden's Saab AB with its Gripen fighter and France's Dassault Aviation SA Rafale and Russian fighter aircraft.
Lockheed Martin, as part of its fighter jet F-21 proposal for the Indian Air Force, signed an MoU with Bharat Electronics Ltd on Friday to explore industrial opportunities around the F-21 fleet, which is essentially building up a spare and supply ecosystem. 
The three aerospace giants, with huge displays at the Defense Expo 2020 held in the northern city of Lucknow, displayed miniaturized versions of the latest aircraft and helicopters that they have pitched to India.
Another French defense firm, Dassault, which recently delivered its first Rafale aircraft to the government in October under a contract to supply 36 units, said it is developing its facility in central India to make the Rafale jets in the subcontinent.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric on Friday berated security forces for failing to protect protesters killed in clashes with rival groups this week in the southern city of Najaf, and urged politicians to pick a government trusted by the people.
The violence in the holy city of Najaf, where Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani is based, killed eight anti-government demonstrators after followers of populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr stormed their sit-in protest.
The incident laid bare new tensions on the street in Iraq, where nearly 500 people have been killed in months of unrest.
The most recent events have pitted young anti-government protesters against many of Sadr's followers, known as blue hats for the caps they wear.
The blue hats turned on protesters in several incidents after Sadr entered a deal with Iran-backed political blocs last week to bring in new Prime Miniser-designate Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi - a move the protesters reject.
Sistani, in remarks delivered by his representative during his weekly Friday sermon in the holy city of Kerbala, condemned the violence in Najaf and blamed security forces for failing to stop it.
""It is the security forces that must take responsibility to keep the peace, protect the protest squares and peaceful demonstrators and identify attackers and rabble rousers,"" the representative said.
""There is no excuse for shirking that duty.""
Sistani holds great influence over public opinion among Iraq's Shi'ite majority. He avoids commenting on politics except during crises. His withdrawal of support for the government of Adel Abdul Mahdi in November sealed the outgoing premier's fate.
Sistani urged that the new government which Allawi will form be representative of the Iraqi people and said it must have their full trust.
""It must be capable of calming the situation and take steps toward early elections free of the influence of money, weapons and foreign interference,"" he said.
SADR'S 'BETRAYAL'
Some protesters had hoped Sistani would reject Allawi who was named last week ending weeks of deadlock between political blocs.
""We hope Sistani will reject Allawi and the deal between the parties on Friday,"" Mahdi Abdul Zahra, a protester in Baghdad, said.
The rival and two most powerful parliamentary blocs of Sadr and a grouping of Iran-backed parties put their differences aside to approve Allawi's nomination.
Sadr has regularly threatened to call all his followers out to protest alongside the anti-government movement. The followers including the blue hats had been unofficially involved in the demonstrations and at times protected protesters from assaults by security forces and Iran-aligned militiamen.
His move to support Allawi, and subsequent calls for the blue hats to remove protest camps deemed to be preventing schools or businesses from functioning, is seen as betrayal by many.
""I used to support the Sadrist movement. But the minute he did this, I stopped. I've erased all by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts that supported him,"" Abdul Zahra said from a main square where protesters skirmished with police.
The protests began in October and swelled in cities throughout the Shi'ite south, pitting impoverished and jobless masses against the Shi'ite-dominated and Iran-aligned government.

Security forces and unidentified gunmen have shot dead nearly 500 people since then.

Chinese-ruled Hong Kong has reported 25 cases of the fast-spreading virus and one of only two deaths outside mainland China.
""Everyone's snatching whatever they can get. I don't even know what's going on,"" said a 72-year-old woman surnamed Li as she clutched two bags of toilet rolls.
The government has condemned ""malicious rumors"" about shortages which have led to panic buying ""and even chaos"", while supermarkets have put limits on the amount of products, including antiseptics, that people can buy.
But hundreds of shoppers thronged city supermarkets again on Friday, loading up their trolleys.
The health scare comes after months of anti-government protests in the former British colony over fears its special autonomy is being whittled away by Beijing, which denies interfering.
Worry over the virus has led to new friction, with many people, particularly medical workers, demanding that the city government seal the border with the mainland.
Hong Kong has closed some cross-border links but has said completely sealing it would be inappropriate, impractical and discriminatory.
On Saturday, Hong Kong will introduce quarantine for two weeks for all people arriving from the mainland, or who have been there during the last 14 days.
Matthew Cheung, chief secretary for administration, said that Hong Kong people returning from the mainland must stay home for a fortnight or risk a HK$25,000 ($3,200) fine and 6 months' jail.
Non-Hong Kong residents must stay in government isolation centers or hotel rooms for the same period, facing the same penalties.
""Self discipline and having everybody in Hong Kong fighting...this infectious disease is the most important thing,"" said Sophia Chan, the city's health secretary.
Thousands of hospital workers who had been on strike this week to press the government to close the border voted to suspend their action on Friday night.
They said they would continue to pressure the government for tighter measures, however.
City authorities said they were conducting checks for the virus on a quarantined cruise ship carrying some 3,600 people that docked in Hong Kong this week.
Health officials are trying to trace people who had traveled on the ship, many of whom disembarked in Hong Kong in January."

Pierce, 60, a former ambassador to Afghanistan, replaces Kim Darroch who resigned last July after U.S. President Donald Trump labeled him “stupid” and “wacky” following the release of confidential memos in which he had branded the U.S. president’s administration inept.
""It is a time of huge opportunity for the friendship between the UK and US and I am delighted that Karen Pierce will take forward this exciting new chapter in our relationship,"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement.
""We’re proud to be sending to Washington such an outstanding diplomat, and I warmly congratulate her on her appointment.""
Pierce is currently Britain's Ambassador to the United Nations in New York and Permanent Representative at the UN Security Council.
Relations between Britain and the United States, which both sides often describe as a ""special relationship"", have fluctuated since Trump took office in 2017.
He criticized Johnson's predecessor Theresa May's handling of Brexit and there have been disagreements over Iran, plans for a tax on digital companies, and most recently Britain's decision to allow Chinese firm Huawei a role in building its 5G mobile phone network.
However, both allies have said ties are strong and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week Britain would be ""at the front of the line"" for a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States.
Pierce began her career at the Foreign Office in 1981 and was Britain's ambassador to Afghanistan between 2015 and 2016.
She has also served as Permanent Representative to the UK Mission to the World Trade Organization among other international organizations.
""I am honored to have been asked to represent the UK in the U.S. I think it is the UK’s single most important relationship,"" she said in a statement."

GENEVA (Reuters) - When 41-year-old Jehanne, a lesbian, was repeatedly insulted for supporting LGBT rights during a tram ride in the Swiss city of Geneva last month, she threatened to call the police.
But her aggressor said his remarks were not a crime under Swiss law.
""I was shaking, I was crying too,"" said Jehanne, an artist and mother of an eight-year-old boy, who asked for her last name to be withheld. ""I looked around me and I was really surprised that no one looked at me or intervened at all.""
In his response to Jehanne, her aggressor was strictly correct, exploiting a Swiss loophole in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights.
Conservative Switzerland, unlike many of its western European neighbors, does not have yet have laws that specifically protect lesbians, gays and bisexuals from discrimination. 
The government hopes to change that. Parliament passed a law in 2018 to extend anti-racism statutes to cover sexual orientation, and offenders could be jailed for three years.
But opponents last April obtained the minimum 50,000 signatures necessary under Switzerland's system of direct democracy to put to the matter to a vote, to be held on Sunday.
""I trust the Swiss people will not let themselves be censored,"" said Marc Früh, a member of the small Federal Democratic Union (EDU) party, which launched the referendum. 
His party, which has a Christian base and is stronger in the German-speaking east, has placed posters around the country showing a blonde woman with bulging eyes and black tape forming a cross over her mouth.
Supporters of the law have countered with images of two pink hearts rubbing up against each other beneath an umbrella - a symbol Jehanne was wearing on a pin the day she was verbally assaulted.
Caroline Dayer, an expert in preventing violence and discrimination, said attacks on gays, already common, had increased as the vote has stirred emotions. In Switzerland, two-thirds of lesbians and 80% of gay men are targeted at some point in their lives, she said.
The government stresses that the new law will not hinder public debate or affect private conversations.
Even jokes about gays are still OK ""as long as they respect human dignity"", Interior Minister Alain Berset said in a video message to voters.
Opinion polls suggest opponents do not have enough backing to scupper the new law, with 65% inclined to vote yes, according to Swiss broadcaster RTS. Even so, the law's supporters say Switzerland still trails most neighbors on LGBT+ rights.
The protections under the new law do not apply to gender identity, for example, meaning transgenders are excluded.
Mathias Reynard, a Socialist MP who first raised the need for homophobia protection in 2013, hopes to bring Switzerland in line with 18 other European jurisdictions on gay marriage and a debate is planned next month. Civil unions are already legal.

""I hope one day we won't need all of this (protection),"" said Jehanne. ""But I have the impression it won't be the case any time soon.""

DENPASAR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Steven Gu, a Chinese tourist on the Indonesian island of Bali, was supposed to fly back last month from his holiday to his home town in Jiangsu province to celebrate the Lunar New Year.
But when he learned about the coronavirus outbreak in China, Gu, who has been in Bali since mid-January, decided to extend his stay with his wife, child and his parents.
""The epidemic in China is very serious now, therefore I hope to keep my family safe by staying in Bali,"" Gu told Reuters.
He is not alone. Thousands of Chinese tourists on the resort island have opted to remain amid fears over the coronavirus, which has killed more than 600.
A Bali-based law and human rights ministry official, Sutrisno, said authorities would help Chinese tourists with visas if they did not want to return yet.
""We will extend their stay for one month. Every visa on arrival can be extended once and for 30 days. But if their country is not safe to return we will help to facilitate this for humanitarian purposes,"" said Sutrisno, who uses one name.
Chinese tourists are among the biggest groups of visitors to Indonesia, especially in destinations such as Bali.
The coronavirus outbreak has already started to hurt Indonesia's tourism industry by halting Chinese tourist arrivals, said the chairman of the China committee at the Indonesian Association of Tours and Travel, Hery Sudiarto.
""The impact on tourism is terrible especially after flights have been cancelled and visas on arrival has been discontinued, it will stop Chinese tourists from coming to Bali in the short term,"" said Sudiarto.
Indonesia, which has not recorded any cases of coronavirus, has barred visitors who have been in China for 14 days and all flights to and from there have been halted since Wednesday.
Gu felt confident the Chinese government would overcome the threat of the virus. ""We will go back when the situation becomes stable ... I hope it will be over soon,"" he said."

The Syrian forces were responding to Israeli strikes on targets in Syria, Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said, quoted by Interfax and other Russian agencies. 
The incident took place a month after a Ukraine International Airlines passenger plane crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board. Iran later said its forces had shot it down unintentionally due to human error.
The Syrian defense ministry said on Thursday it had intercepted Israeli missiles over Damascus that were fired at military targets in southern Syria. Israel has declined to comment.
The Airbus A320 (PA:AIR) had been coming into land at Damascus International Airport when it was forced to divert to the nearest alternative airfield, the Hmeimim Air Base near Latakia in northwest Syria, which is operated by the Russian military. 
Konashenkov did not name the airline but data from Flight Radar indicated it was a Syrian Cham Wings plane. The airline could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The United States imposed sanctions on Cham Wings in 2016 for allegedly transporting fighters to Syria to support President Bashir al-Assad and for helping Syrian military intelligence transport weapons and equipment. 
The flights, which almost always land late at night, do not appear in any airport or airline timetables, and fly in from either Damascus or Latakia, where Russia has a military base.
A Cham Wings plane had flown Iran's General Qassem Soleimani from Damascus to Baghdad shortly before the military commander was killed by the United States in an air strike in January, Reuters reported in January.
Israel has repeatedly bombed Iranian-backed militia targets in Syria, saying its goal was to end Tehran's military presence in the country, which has been locked in a civil war since 2011. 
Konashenkov accused Israel of using civilian aircraft as cover to block Syrian air defenses from responding to Israeli combat missions, which he said had become a characteristic feature of the Israeli air force.
""Such operations by Israeli strategists gamble the lives of hundreds of innocent people,"" Konashenkov said. 
""The movement of regular passenger flights both in Syrian airspace and around the world is carried out in known, high-altitude echelons, which Israeli radar can clearly see."" 
Spokespeople for the Israeli military and foreign ministry declined to comment.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Hailing from one of the world's poorest country, Nigerien sprinter Aminatou Seyni is no stranger to life's hurdles, but as she prepares for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, the 23-year-old faces fresh obstacles.
Despite clocking the fifth-fastest time in the 400 metres last year, Seyni may not be able to compete in her favoured event because she refuses to take hormone suppressants for elevated testosterone levels.
In 2018, World Athletics, the sport's international governing body, imposed a testosterone cap for races between 400m and a mile, arguing that hyperandrogenous female athletes enjoy an unfair advantage at those distances.
The rule, which also affects the South African double Olympic 800 metres champion, Caster Semenya, will likely limit Seyni to the 200 metres in Tokyo.
""I feel a little bit sad because if I ran the 400 metres I could have won a medal, but for the 200 there are a lot of athletes that are better developed,"" said Seyni, wearing a pink windbreaker and blue leggings, as she took a break from training in Senegal's capital, Dakar.
Like Semenya, Seyni, who has a deep voice and powerful physique, refuses to take medication to reduce her testosterone levels.
Semenya said the treatment made her constantly sick when she took it earlier in her career and she is appealing a decision last year by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upholding the World Athletics' rule.
Seyni was barred from competing in the 400m at November's world championships in Doha following a breakout season in which only two runners posted faster times.
She reached the semi-finals in the 200 metres in Doha. She is also aiming to compete in the 100 metres at the Olympics.
Despite the disappointment of likely exclusion from the 400m in Tokyo, Seyni is determined to try for what would be only the second Olympic medal since 1972 for Niger, an arid West African country ranking last on the U.N. Human Development Index.
""I only want to concentrate on the 100 and 200 to see how it goes, because it's different,"" she said. ""I'll do my best to see if I can win a medal."""

Singapore now has 33 confirmed coronavirus cases.
The orange alert means the virus is severe and passes easily from person to person and was last raised during an outbreak of H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) killed more than 30 people in Singapore and hundreds worldwide.
""As there are now a few local cases without any links to previous cases or travel history to China, we have stepped up our risk assessment,"" the health ministry said in a statement, adding that firms should be prepared for ""widespread community transmission"".
The highest alert is red, which indicates the virus is spreading widely.
Singapore advised businesses to cancel or defer non-essential large-scale events but said the Singapore Airshow will go ahead next week although organisers may limit public visitors.
Of the new cases reported on Friday, one was a teacher and authorities said all students and staff who had come into contact with her would have to spend two weeks at home.
A British man has also contracted the coronavirus after travelling to a business meeting in Singapore which has also been linked to cases in the city-state, Malaysia and South Korea, health ministry official Kenneth Mak said.
Mak said authorities had not yet identified the source of infection at the meeting of more than 100 employees from an as-yet-unnamed firm at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in mid-January."

Cavusoglu repeated Turkey would do whatever is necessary to stop a humanitarian tragedy in Idlib, where on Thursday Russian-led Syrian forces entered the strategic town of Saraqeb in a push to capture the country's last rebel stronghold.
The fighting has already displaced half a million people since early December, and Turkey fears another wave of refugees heading for its border. 
Eight Turkish military personnel were killed on Monday in shelling by Syrian government forces in Idlib province, where Ankara has sent reinforcements in the last week.
Turkey already had a dozen military observation posts positioned around a 'de-escalation zone' in the region agreed by Turkey, Russia and Iran, but several posts have now been surrounded by advancing Syrian government forces.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said that Turkish troops were establishing a new military post east of Idlib city, home to more than one million people, many already displaced from other parts of Syria.

Moscow and Tehran have supported President Bashar al-Assad during Syria's nearly nine-year conflict, while Ankara has backed rebels who sought to topple Assad.

Rob Macaire was called an ""undesirable element"" by Iran's judiciary after officials accused him of attending an illegal protest last month and a hardline cleric said he should be expelled, state media reported.
The ambassador said he had attended a vigil for victims of the crash of a Ukrainian airliner, amid public anger over Iran’s belated admission that it accidentally shot down the plane. 
Britain called Macaire's detention a violation of diplomatic conventions, and he flew back to London in mid-January.
In an Instagram video posted on Thursday, Macaire said in Farsi that that visit was ""an important trip that was planned some time ago"" and had included a meeting with foreign minister Dominic Raab.
Macaire, who has been in the post since 2018, added that he had recently returned to Tehran.
Tensions between Iran and the West have risen since top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3, prompting an Iranian missile attack against a U.S. base in Iraq days later.
Friction between Tehran and Washington has been building since 2018, when President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a six-nation nuclear deal in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of most sanctions. 
Iran announced in January that it would abandon restrictions on enriching uranium but would continue to cooperate with the U.N. nuclear watchdog. 
Macaire said in the video posting that Britain wanted to use the dispute resolution mechanism in the nuclear deal - which Britain, France and Germany triggered last month - to find a path forward.

GAPYEONG, South Korea (Reuters) - South Korean groom Lee Kwon-seok was excited to join thousands of other couples in the latest mass wedding performed by South Korea's Unification Church on Friday, but he and his bride weren't taking any chances amid the coronavirus outbreak.
They brought their own surgical masks to wear - his black to match his suit, and hers white to match her dress.
""I'm very happy to attend this deeply blessed joint wedding,"" said Lee, 35. ""Since coronavirus is going around these days, I wore a mask to be careful.""
About 30,000 people from around the world gathered at the Cheong Shim Peace World Center in Gapyeong, northeast of Seoul, according to the church. Among them were 6,000 new couples getting married, while the others were renewing vows or watching.
The mass weddings are a well-known feature of the South Korea-based church, but the spread of the new coronavirus, first reported in China, has cast a pall over many public events.
Church staff prepared hand sanitizer, handed out surgical masks and checked couples' temperature.
In the end, only a few couples wore masks at the wedding ceremony, which was overseen by Hak Ja Han Moon, wife of the founder of the Unification Church, and known to believers as ""True Mother.""
""I didn't put on a mask because I want to be beautiful for my husband,"" said a 23-year-old bride from Benin, Nguessan Myeonguet Walehet. ""I want just meet the True Mother, because it's most important for me.""
The church said the wedding was successful. The event had special significance as it also marked the 100th anniversary of founder Sun Myung Moon's birth.
The Unification Church was founded in 1954 by the late Moon, who declared he and his wife were messiahs. From 1961 until his death in 2012, he oversaw mass weddings at which thousands were matched with spouses they sometimes had just met and who, in some cases, did not even speak the same language."

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - India has extended the detention of four political leaders in Kashmir who had been held by authorities since August to quell dissent after the central government stripped the region of its autonomy, two senior officials said on Friday.
The latest detention order was issued under the draconian Public Safety Act, which allows detention without charges for up to two years, the officials in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu & Kashmir state, told Reuters.
The four included two former chief ministers of India's only Muslim majority state, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, and two regional party leaders, Ali Mohmmad Sagar and Sartaj Madni, the officials said.
They were originally held under a law that allowed a maximum of six months, and their detention was about to expire.
""The law does not allow preventive detention beyond six months. So they had to be either released or booked under PSA,"" said one government official on condition of anonymity.
""Several other regional leaders who have also completed six months under preventive detention are likely to be booked under PSA,"" the second official said.
The officials requested anonymity due to the sensitivity over security matters. Reuters sought a response from the Home Ministry, but its spokesman was unavailable for comment.
The home ministry in a reply before the parliament on Thursday said 389 people in Kashmir were already booked under PSA since August last year.
Some of those detained have been put under house arrest, while others have been taken elsewhere.
Rights group Amnesty International has described the PSA as a ""lawless law"".
Mehbooba Mufti's daughter Iltija Mufti confirmed her mother's detention under the law on Twitter.
""Slapping the draconian PSA... is expected from an autocratic regime that books nine-year-olds for 'seditious remarks'. Question is how much longer will we act as bystanders as they desecrate what this nation stands for?"" said Iltija in a tweet.
The removal of autonomy and subsequent crackdown in Kashmir drew international criticism, and diplomats from several countries say they have raised human rights concerns with India's foreign ministry.
Last month, India's Supreme Court rebuked the federal government for shutting down Internet and telecommunications in the state.
A ban on public meetings remains in place, but unrest seen in the weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government stripped Kashmir of its autonomy has died down, and an uneasy calm prevails amid a heavy security presence.
Modi's government has argued that the detention of politicians and internet blackout were needed to maintain order in a region where security forces have been fighting a long-running separatist insurgency encouraged by neighboring Pakistan. Islamabad denies giving material support to the insurgency.
Ahead of scrapping of Kashmir's autonomy, India's federal government had detained around 5,000 people including businessmen, civil society members, lawyers and activists to prevent protests breaking out.
Kashmir lay at the heart of two of the three wars fought by India and Pakistan since independence in 1947, and the dispute between the now nuclear armed neighbors over the Himalayan region remains unresolved."
1364,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 01:31AM ET</span>","Exclusive: 'Shock and awe' has failed in Philippines drug war, enforcement chief says","By Tom Allard and Karen Lema
MANILA (Reuters) - Colonel Romeo Caramat oversaw the bloodiest day in the blood-soaked war on drugs in the Philippines – 32 people killed in 24 hours in the province north of Manila where he was police chief in 2017.
Now the head of drug enforcement for the Philippine National Police, Caramat said that ultra-violent approach to curbing illicit drugs had not been effective.
""Shock and awe definitely did not work,"" he told Reuters in an interview, speaking out for the first time on the issue. ""Drug supply is still rampant.""
Caramat said the volume of crime had decreased as a result of the drug war, but users could still buy illegal drugs ""any time, anywhere"" in the Philippines.
He said he now favored a new strategy. Rather than quickly arresting or killing low-level pushers and couriers, he wants to put them under surveillance in the hope they lead police to ""big drug bosses"".
Three and a half years after President Rodrigo Duterte launched a war on drugs in the Philippines with a call to kill addicts and traffickers, his signature policy has failed in many key objectives, according to police officers, health professionals and government officials.
Duterte's spokesman, Salvador Panelo, did not respond to requests for comment on Caramat's statements. But in a statement on Jan. 6 responding to a request from Reuters for comment on the anti-drug campaign, Panelo said ""we are winning the war on drugs"".
Duterte, however, has repeatedly said in recent speeches and interviews that the anti-drugs campaign has fallen short, blaming endemic corruption for undermining enforcement and the absence of a death penalty for failing to deter crime.
Critics say that problems with the drug war run deeper, pointing to a failure to target high-level drug traffickers, cut the supply of drugs and invest in rehabilitation.
""Heavy suppression efforts marked by extra-judicial killings and street arrests were not going to slow down demand,"" said Jeremy Douglas, the Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Bangkok.
""There has to be a focus on prevention and public health, coupled with intelligent policing that takes on transnational crime.""
SHABU DELUGE
Caramat's criticism of the tactics that marked his tenure as Bulacan province's police chief is remarkable given the nationwide fame he enjoyed for the killings, and the rapid promotions that followed.
After news emerged of the one-day death count in Bulacan in Aug. 2017, local media reported Duterte saying: ""Let's kill another 32 every day. Maybe we can reduce what ails this country.""
Caramat estimates ""hundreds"" died in Bulacan when he was police chief. The Philippines government says 5,532 people have been killed in anti-drug police operations nationwide since mid-2016.
Human rights groups suspect the nationwide death toll is much higher. Amnesty International said in a report last June that ""evidence points to many thousands more killed by unknown armed persons with likely links to the police"".
Caramat says that those killed on his watch violently resisted arrest. But he agrees with critics that the anti-drugs strategy has mostly targeted low-level operatives.
""For almost three years, we are arresting the street pusher or the courier. After we have arrested the drug courier, we stopped,"" he said in the interview, conducted in December.
After a brief pause when the drug war was declared, transnational crime groups have flooded the country with crystal meth - the most popular illegal drug in the Philippines, known locally as shabu, according to law enforcement officers, government officials and experts.
Vice President Leni Robredo, a political rival of Duterte who was appointed ""drugs tsar"" last year but fired 18 days later for ""failing to introduce new measures"" among other alleged shortcomings, said in a report handed to the president last month that the inability to constrict the supply of illicit drugs had been a ""massive failure"". 
The report added that ""attention and resources were disproportionately focused on street-level enforcement"". After being fired, Robredo said that the government was ""afraid of what I might discover"".
Panelo, the president's spokesman, criticized Robredo's ""baseless extrapolations"" on drug supply at the time, saying that drug lords had been ""neutralized"" and that the crime rate had fallen. 
""Close to eight out of 10 Filipinos are satisfied with the national administration's campaign against illegal drugs,"" Panelo said.
A survey by Social Weather Stations, a Filipino polling group, in June found 82% of those surveyed were satisfied with the anti-drug campaign.
According to figures provided by the Philippines to the UNODC, crystal meth seizures have climbed in the past year and were on track to more than double in 2019.
However, the average retail price for meth, at $136 per gram, is below the $164 it cost when the war on drugs began in 2016, according to the figures. The cheaper prices, said the UNODC's Douglas, suggests that far more of the drug is reaching the streets than is being stopped.
A $50 million drug bust in November highlighted the oversupply, according to Caramat. More than 370 kilograms of crystal meth was allegedly found stacked in a wardrobe in a flat rented by suspected Chinese drug trafficker.
But, said Caramat, ""it turned out that was just the leftovers"". On the trafficker's phone were pictures of tonnes of meth stored elsewhere in the Philippines, he said.
REHAB WOES
Efforts to cut demand for drugs, including treatment and counseling for the country's estimated 1.3 million registered addicts, have also been hampered by lack of funding and poor organization, according to analysts and officials interviewed by Reuters.
The limitations of those efforts were highlighted by the small number of patients being treated at the Mega Drug Abuse Treatment and Rehabilitation Center, in Nueva Ecija, some 100 kilometers north of Manila during a recent visit by Reuters.
Residents rise early at 4.30 a.m., receive medication and counseling,  receive medication and counseling, interspersed with prayer, meals and Zumba classes that last until 8.30 p.m.
But while it was built to house 10,000 addicts, the facility has seen just 2,085 severe drug addicts complete the program over three-and-a-half years, according to a PowerPoint presentation from the center reviewed by Reuters.
Government figures show that in-patient treatment at rehabilitation centers nationwide dropped from 5,648 in 2016 to 5,477 in 2018.
With minimal funding allocated to rehabilitation, most addicts have been unable to access even community-based, out-patient programs, officials and health workers say. Those that get access usually just listen to a lecture or watch a video.
""We were caught with our pants down when the war on drugs started,"" said Benjamin Reyes, chairman of the drug reduction committee of the Philippines Dangerous Drugs Board, a government agency. Reyes added that rehabilitation was now a priority for the government and that funding was set to rise this year. 
SHIFT IN STRATEGY?
Government figures show that 500 people were killed in the drug war last year, which compares with 3,000 killed in the first year of the campaign.
But rights activists are skeptical that a major shift in the anti-drug strategy is in the works.
""It looks like the numbers are falling but data from government can't be trusted because they've been manipulating or massaging the figures,"" said Carlos Conde, Philippines researcher with Human Rights Watch. Reuters couldn't independently confirm this.
As recently as November, Duterte spoke of killing ""drug personalities"" and throwing their bodies into Manila Bay. 

In December, the Philippines' new police chief, Lieutenant General Archie Gamboa, Caramat's superior, was quoted in the Philippine Star newspaper saying that police had been too tolerant combating drug offenders and urged officers to ""neutralize"" them if they felt under threat. Gamboa did not respond to a request for comment.

1365,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 12:06AM ET</span>",Australia celebrates as heavy rains dampen huge bushfires,"By Byron Kaye and Renju Jose
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Much of Australia's wildfire-ravaged east coast was drenched on Friday by the biggest rainfall in almost 20 years, dousing some of the most dangerous blazes and providing welcome relief to farmers battling an extended drought.
The downpour came with its own risks - officials warned of flash floods and landslides across New South Wales (NSW), Australia's most populous state - but was generally greeted jubilantly after months of devastating bushfires. 
""There's lots of smiles around the place,"" NSW Rural Fire Services (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons, who has been more accustomed in recent weeks to delivering fire evacuation orders, told reporters in Sydney. 
""It is breaking the back of this fire season, no doubt,"" Fitzsimmons said. ""The rain is good for business and farms as well as being really good for quenching some of these fires we've been dealing with for many, many months.""
The deluge had the effect of calming the number of active fires in NSW by 20 in a single day, a success rate that NSW RFS said it was ""over the moon"" about. 
By afternoon, there were 40 active fires in NSW, less than half the number of blazes at the peak of the crisis, with all burning at the lowest level danger warning of ""advice"" only. Neighboring Victoria state had 21 active fires, also at the lowest level.
Around 11.7 million hectares of Australian wilderness have been razed by a series of huge wildfires since September that have also killed 33 people and more than a billion animals and destroyed thousands of homes. The horrific extended bushfire season has followed a three-year drought across the country.
The heavy rainfall across NSW and Victoria state on Friday was something of a welcome surprise after the Bureau of Meteorology's three-month forecast issued in January forecast continued high temperatures and little rainfall. 
Sydney alone was expected to receive as much as 130 millimeters of rain in the 24 hours to Saturday morning, the biggest one-day rainfall since Feb. 5, 2002, data on the bureau's website showed on Friday.
""What we are broadly expecting over the next couple of days is this coastal trough to hang around, to keep delivering this widespread, prolonged, steady rainfall,"" BOM forecaster Jane Golding said.
Fitzsimmons said he was optimistic the continued rainfall over the coming days would help firefighters in NSW get the 17 blazes that are still categorized as ""uncontained"" under control. 
""We expect rainfall to continue to fall across a lot of these firegrounds and that will result in a number of those being declared contained and hopefully we will be confident we won't see new ignitions from anywhere in those firegrounds,"" he said.
CYCLONE DAMIEN 
Some 3,500 kilometers (2174.8 miles) to the northwest, a tropical cyclone was barreling toward the coast of Western Australia where it is expected to make landfall near Port Hedland, the world's largest iron ore port, on Saturday.
Destructive wind gusts of up to 150 kilometers per hour could develop overnight Friday night as the cyclone approaches the coast, and very destructive gusts of up to 230 kilometers per hour were expected when Cyclone Damien hits on Saturday, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.
Authorities said Port Hedland would be cleared ahead of the cyclone and the Dampier Port also closed.
Miners  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) and BHP Group said they were monitoring the situation and making preparations.
The wet weather prompted some light-hearted remarks at a visit by British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to the Sydney office of pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca PLC.
""We are all very, very happy that you are here today, but also importantly that you're bringing this fine British rain with you,"" AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot told guests. 

""We really have brought the rain,"" replied Raab.

""Under Rimi, AQAP committed unconscionable violence against civilians in Yemen and sought to conduct and inspire numerous attacks against the United States and our forces,"" Trump said in a statement.
""His death further degrades AQAP and the global al-Qa’ida movement, and it brings us closer to eliminating the threats these groups pose to our national security,"" the president said. He did not say when Raymi was killed.
The United States regards AQAP as one of the deadliest branches of the al Qaeda network founded by Osama bin Laden.

1367,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 09:16PM ET</span>","To counter Huawei, U.S. could take 'controlling stake' in Ericsson, Nokia: attorney general","By Mark Hosenball and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr said on Thursday the United States and its allies should consider the highly unusual step of taking a ""controlling stake"" in Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) to counter China-based Huawei's dominance in next-generation 5G wireless technology.
In a remarkable statement underscoring how far the United States may be willing to go to counter Huawei Technologies Co, Barr disclosed in a speech at a conference on Chinese economic espionage that there had been proposals to meet the concerns ""by the United States aligning itself with Nokia and/or Ericsson.""
Barr said the alignment could take place ""through American ownership of a controlling stake, either directly or through a consortium of private American and allied companies.""
""Putting our large market and financial muscle behind one or both of these firms would make it a far more formidable competitor and eliminate concerns over its staying power, or their staying power,"" Barr said.
""We and our closest allies certainly need to be actively considering this approach,"" he added at the event hosted by Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
Both firms have a combined market capitalization of about $50 billion and it is not clear what source of funds the U.S. government could potentially tap to take stakes in the firms or if foreign regulators would approve.
Ericsson declined to comment, while Nokia did not immediately comment. The companies' shares edged higher after Barr's comments in European trading.
Last month, a group of six U.S. senators introduced legislation to provide over $1 billion to invest in Western-based alternatives to Chinese equipment providers Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763) and accelerate development of an open-architecture to allow for alternative vendors to enter the market for specific network components.
Barr said China had emerged as the ""top geo-political adversary"" and added: ""China has stolen a march and is now leading in 5G ... They have already captured 40 percent of the market and are now aggressively pursuing the balance.""
U.S. government investments in public companies are rare except in the case of bailouts to save ailing firms and jobs, and such investments in foreign companies are even rarer.
U.S. officials have criticized Huawei for its close ties to the Chinese government and they added the company to an economic blacklist last year, saying it was involved in activities contrary to U.S. national security. The Trump administration has pressed nations not to grant Huawei access to 5G networks and alleged Huawei’s equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, which the Chinese company has repeatedly denied.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order last year barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk.
At the same CSIS event, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Beijing was seeking to steal American technology by ""any means necessary.""
He said the bureau currently had about 1,000 open investigations of Chinese technology theft across its 56 regional offices, while FBI counterintelligence chief John Brown said it had arrested 24 people last year in China-related cases and another 19 already in 2020.
Wray said the investigations spanned ""just about every industry sector"" and the threat needed to be addressed through action across the whole of the U.S. government.
China was aggressively exploiting U.S. academic openness to steal technology, using ""campus proxies"" and establishing ""institutes on our campuses,"" Wray added.
William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said that among China's priorities was stealing U.S. aircraft and electric vehicle technology.In advance of Thursday's event, Evanina estimated the theft of American trade secrets by China costs the United States ""anywhere from $300 to $600 billion"" a year.
The comments from the top law enforcement officials reflect an aggressively stepped-up campaign by the Trump administration to counter Chinese espionage operations. 
This has snared a growing group of Chinese government officials, business people, and academics. 
The campaign has included charges against a leading American academic at one of the top U.S. universities.
Last month, prosecutors charged Charles Lieber, chair of Harvard University's Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, with lying about participating in China's Thousand Talents Plan, which aims to attract research specialists working overseas.
The Chinese embassy in Washington earlier rejected the U.S. allegations as ""entirely baseless.""

""The people-to-people exchange between China and the US is conducive to stronger understanding between the two peoples and serves the fundamental interests of our two countries,"" it said.

1368,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 09:16PM ET</span>",Courts are the next front in Trump's battle over presidential powers,"By Lawrence Hurley and Jan Wolfe
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In federal court and on the Senate floor, lawyers for President Donald Trump have argued that the U.S. Constitution confers on a president broad protection from scrutiny by Congress, prosecutors and the judiciary for his actions.
This expansive view of presidential powers may have helped the Republican president win acquittal on Wednesday in his Senate impeachment trial, but a raft of court rulings due in the coming weeks and months could have an even more profound impact on setting the parameters for a president's authority.
Three cases will be argued before the Supreme Court on March 31 focusing on Trump's contention that a House of Representatives committee and a New York City prosecutor are powerless to enforce subpoenas to obtain his financial records. Lawyers for Trump argued that the Constitution renders sitting presidents immune from all criminal investigations and that even if he shot someone on New York's Fifth Avenue prosecutors would be powerless to act while he was still in office.
The Supreme Court eventually could be called upon to decide another major case now awaiting a ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In that one, the Justice Department argued that senior presidential aides are immune from congressional subpoenas for testimony like one issued by the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee to former White House Counsel Don McGahn.
The rulings in those cases could set enduring legal precedents.
In impeachment trials, ""no current Congress can bind a future Congress,"" said University of Missouri law professor and impeachment expert Frank Bowman, meaning whatever arguments Trump's lawyers advanced applied only to that trial.
""Courts are different. They have got to explain. And, at least in theory, what the high court decides binds all lower courts,"" Bowman added.
The Supreme Court previously curbed presidential power in key cases. 
In 1997, it ruled that President Bill Clinton could not evade a civil lawsuit brought by Paula Jones, a woman who accused him of making unwanted sexual advances. In 1974, it ruled against President Richard Nixon's bid to avoid handing over audiotapes and other material to a federal judge as part of a criminal investigation into the Watergate corruption scandal.
During the impeachment trial, Trump's legal team argued for an unconstrained presidency. They also said that the charges brought by the House - abuse of power and contempt of Congress - did not cover conduct that amounted to impeachable offenses. 
They argued that if a president trying to win re-election believes he is acting in the national interest, any quid pro quo - a Latin term meaning a favor for a favor - arrangement aimed at boosting his election chances cannot be impeachable. They also argued that an impeachable offense must be a violation of a statutory law.
Democrats said this sweeping assessment of presidential power would embolden Trump and future presidents to act with impunity.
'EXTREME AND RIDICULOUS'
It remains to be seen whether such arguments will win favor at the Supreme Court, whose 5-4 conservative majority includes two justices appointed by Trump.
""I doubt there's five votes for the more extreme and ridiculous arguments made by the president's lawyers in the Senate,"" said Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School in Virginia. 
Some of the Trump team's statements at the impeachment trial, Somin added, ""may damage their credibility.""
In the McGahn case, Trump administration lawyers argued that Congress cannot force a presidential aide to testify even in its usual oversight role, and that impeachment is the only real power Congress has to police a president's conduct. Trump directed current and former officials not to provide testimony or documents in the House impeachment inquiry.
""The aggressive position he (Trump) took in the impeachment trial could have an indirect impact in the courts,"" said Michael Stern, a former House lawyer when it was under Republican control.
Trump lost in the lower courts in all three of the Supreme Court cases. Two involve Trump's bid to ward off congressional subpoenas issued to third parties - Trump's accounting firm Mazars LLP and two banks,  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF) - seeking his bank records, tax returns and other material.
The other case involves a criminal investigation into Trump and his family real estate business in which Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, is seeking the president's tax returns. The Supreme Court is due to rule by the end of June in the three cases.
The Justice Department has argued that the House Judiciary Committee lacks legal standing to enforce its subpoena on McGahn and that senior presidential advisers are ""absolutely immune"" from being forced to testify to Congress about official acts. It also argued that federal courts lack the authority to referee such disputes between the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. government.

Another important legal fight was put on hold by a federal judge awaiting the McGahn case's outcome. In that case, the House Ways and Means Committee sued the Treasury Department to force it to hand over years of Trump's individual and business federal tax returns.

EL PASO, Texas (Reuters) - A Texas man accused of deliberately targeting people of Mexican heritage in a shooting rampage that killed 22 people at an El Paso Walmart (N:WMT) store last year was charged on Thursday on 90 counts of federal hate crimes.
The charges against Patrick Crusius, 21, included 22 counts under the U.S. classification of hate crimes - violence with an added element of bias - resulting in death, for which he could face the death penalty.
Crusius was charged last year by state courts, where his capital murder trial is in its early stages.
Crusius would now face a separate trial in federal court, John Bash, the U.S. attorney for the western district of Texas, told reporters after the grand jury indictment.
""We all share same goal here - to achieve justice for the families of the victims,"" Bash said.
Bash said the El Paso shooting was an act of domestic terrorism and an attack against an entire ethnic group.
""We're firing on all cylinders to stop this. We're going to stop hate crimes,"" he said.
Crusius is accused of driving 11 hours to El Paso from his hometown of Allen, near Dallas, on Aug. 3 last year and firing at shoppers with an AK-47 rifle inside the Walmart store. He surrendered to officers who confronted him outside.
Crusius confessed while surrendering and told police he was targeting Mexicans, according to an El Paso police affidavit released days after the shooting. Most of those killed were Latinos.
In a manifesto prosecutors say was posted online by Crusius on 8chan, a now-defunct message board often used by extremists, the accused shooter said his Walmart attack ""is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.""
The federal indictment quoted the manifesto as also saying that Crusius was ""defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by the invasion.""
Democrats have said that Republican President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant and racially charged language at political rallies and on Twitter has fanned racist, white nationalist sentiments, creating a political climate that is conducive to hate-based violence.
Former Texas congressman and El Paso native Beto O'Rourke, at the time of the shooting one of the contenders for the Democratic nomination for president, said Trump ""helped create the hatred"" that made the massacre possible.
Trump has roundly rejected the criticisms as Democrats looking to score political points off a tragedy."

Despite this, Beijing would typically be thronged with morning traffic and tourists heading to Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ), the Great Hall of the People and the Forbidden City. 
Instead, Reuters Greater China Chief video producer Mark Chisholm has spent the last 10 days commuting through a ""ghost city"" to work amid an extension of the Lunar New Year holidays due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
""You see empty walkways, empty streets with very little cars, bicycles or motorbikes,"" Chisholm said. 
The virus, believed to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed more than 630 people and infected more than 31,000, the vast majority of them in China.
The outbreak is also inflicting a growing toll on businesses and consumers in the world's second-largest economy. Strict transport curbs have been imposed in many parts of the country, and like Beijing, some cities are in virtual lockdown.
Chisholm exits the diplomatic compound where he lives through double doors, and a guard at the gate wearing a face mask checks his temperature. 
Chisholm finds Chang'an Avenue, the capital's main thoroughfare, almost completely deserted, with one or two people standing at bus stops, and roads devoid of traffic.
He then heads down a flight of steps into the underground Yong'anli train station on Line 1, his voice echoing in the vacant stairwell. The only people he encounters are the workers operating the thermal scanner at the turnstiles. 
A platform normally packed with hundreds of people is eerily empty, the automated announcements reverberating in the otherwise silent station. Passengers sit in small groups on the train, everyone masked and no one making eye contact. 
Chisholm gets off and walks into the three-storey Wangfujing shopping mall, filled with shuttered shops and bright red Lunar New Year decorations featuring oversized rodents to mark the Year of the Rat. 
Finally, as Chisholm nears the Reuters offices, he sees a man in a hazard suit spraying disinfectant into dark corridors from a yellow backpack. 
""I've lived in Beijing for 15 years and never seen the city so deserted,"" Chisholm said. ""I actually find it rather sad that this usually vibrant place has become a ghost city with 25 million people holed up in their apartments.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian judge indicted six people accused of hacking the phones of prosecutors in the country's biggest corruption case on Thursday, but held off ""for now"" on accepting cybercrimes charges against U.S. journalist Glenn Greenwald.
The judge, Ricardo Soares Leite, said the Supreme Court had to rule first on an earlier injunction shielding Greenwald from investigation before he could decide on the indictment, which charges Greenwald, editor of news website The Intercept, with allegedly abetting the hacking as it published leaked information.
""I decline, for now, to receive the complaint against Glenn Greenwald, due to the controversy over the extent of the injunction granted by Minister Gilmar Mendes,"" the judge wrote.
The damaging leaks showed then-judge Sergio Moro, who is now justice minister, advising prosecutors in the graft case against former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who was jailed for corruption but released 18 months later.
Intercept Brasil, edited by Greenwald, published the leaked conversations that pointed to collusion between the judge and the prosecuting team. He was charged last month with criminal association with the group of six people accused of hacking the phones of members of the prosecutors team in the so-called Car Wash investigation.
Greenwald welcomed the judge's decision not to proceed with the charges, but said it was insufficient to guarantee the rights of a free press.
""This is not enough. We seek a decisive rejection from the Supreme Court of this abusive prosecution on the grounds that it is a clear and grave assault on core press freedoms,"" he said in a statement.
Greenwald, a resident of Brazil and fierce critic of far right President Jair Bolsonaro, is best known for his work on the disclosures of Edward Snowden, the American former National Security Agency contractor who leaked secret documents about U.S. telephone and internet surveillance in 2013.
Greenwald's lawyers argued that he should not have been charged because an injunction by Supreme Court Justice Gilmar Mendes had barred prosecutors from investigating him for information published in the media.

Mendes cited Greenwald's ""constitutional right to the protection of journalistic sources.""

WYTALIBA, Australia (Reuters) - Even as a fierce bushfire bore down on the rural Australian community of Wytaliba, Gary Wilson and his partner Julie Willis decided not to flee their timber home - they had a house full of orphaned baby kangaroos to protect.
More than a dozen of the marsupials snuggled into fabric pouches hung in the couple's living room, like stockings on Christmas Eve.
Full-grown kangaroos and other wildlife that had left their care long ago also came back to the house in search of refuge as the flames approached. 
""We had way too many animals in the house and around the house so we really couldn't go ... we decided we were going to stay and fight,"" Wilson told Reuters, at the couple's off-the-grid home, now surrounded by scorched earth and burnt-out vehicles.
""At three o'clock it was a beautiful summer's day, by four o'clock it was midnight,"" Wilson said. ""You couldn't see any more than 20 yards and then the firestorm came through and pretty much burned everything.""
Wilson and Willis defended their home for at least 14 hours with fire extinguishers, water pumps and a sprinkler system on the roof that doused burning embers falling from the sky.
Good preparation and more than an ounce of luck meant the couple's cypress-pine home still stands - and the motherless joeys survived. The Nov. 8 fire that swept through the small Wytaliba community, which was originally set up as a commune in the 1970s, killed two of Wilson's neighbors. 
""It was a horrible thing ... the whole bush has been burnt. It's been vaporized - it's Vietnam is what it looks like,"" Wilson said as infant kangaroos ate grain from a trough fashioned from a car tyre and lined up two-by-two to be bottle-fed special milk.
Willis said she had never seen fires so fierce, and that most animals, such as possums, gliders, echidnas, lizards and even many birds were not fast enough to escape the flames.
""It's not until after the fires when it really hits you how close you were to dying but at the time you are too busy trying to put the fire out,"" she said.
Australia's prolonged bushfire season has killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals since September. About 2,500 homes have been destroyed and more than 11.7 million hectares (28.9 million acres) of tinder-dry bushland have been razed.
The number of boarders at the Wytaliba home, which has been a sanctuary for wildlife for 25 years, is ballooning as the fallout from the fires continues with burns, scarce food and ash-tainted water still devastating local wildlife.
While Wilson and Willis usually care for joeys rescued after their mothers are struck by vehicles, they are now hosting an increasing number of fire orphans. 
Willis said the joeys, which are fed a special milk formula every two to four hours just like their human counterparts, will eventually be released back into the wild.
""We didn't have children ourselves; this is what we spend our time doing,' she said, as she gently stroked a joey on her lap while another nudged her feet. ""We think it's worthy - a worthy cause - looking after our babies no matter what they are, whether they are kangaroos, echidnas or wombats.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday denounced U.S. foreign policy in Venezuela, criticizing U.S. ""provocations"" and attempts to create what he called a pretext for military intervention.
Russia and the United States have repeatedly clashed over Venezuela, where Russian oil companies and military advisers are playing a key role in support of the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro.
The United States and dozens of other countries recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has been trying to oust Maduro, as Venezuela's rightful president. Washington has imposed sanctions in a bid to dislodge Maduro.
Lavrov, on a visit to Mexico, condemned attempts to remove Maduro as not ""useful,"" and said Washington's threats against Venezuela were counterproductive.
""No one can solve the problems of Venezuelans for them, but others may very well try to prevent them from negotiating. We see such attempts aimed at setting a pretext for a military intervention,"" Lavrov said, according to Russian state news agency Tass. 
""Russia and Mexico agree that this will be categorically unacceptable,"" Lavrov added, according to Tass.
Lavrov met with Mexican counterpart Marcelo Ebrard on Thursday and afterwards said U.S. foreign policy was stuck in the past, and accused it of using bullying tactics.
""The United States thinks that everything is allowed and in the meantime they threaten the interlocutors, including punishments and sanctions,"" Lavrov said at a news conference in Mexico City, according to a live translation of his comments into Spanish. 
Lavrov said the United States was ""threatening that all options are on the table"" and was involved in ""provocations"" in Venezuela.
Lavrov also blamed Guaido for the suspension of last year's talks with the Venezuelan government in Oslo.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday condemned the ""cruel and indefensible"" detention of executives from U.S. refiner Citgo in Caracas, said the top U.S. envoy for Venezuela, who also warned Russia over its support for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
Venezuelan police seized the six executives who had been under house arrest, their families and an attorney said. Citgo is owned by Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA.
The executives ""had been taken from house arrest by the regime's intelligence agencies and we believe they are now detained at Helicoide prison"" in Caracas, Elliott Abrams, U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela, told reporters in a briefing in Washington. 
Abrams called the detentions ""cruel and indefensible"" and said their timing on Wednesday was ""suspicious"" as Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, recognized as the country's rightful president by the United States and dozens of other countries, met with President Donald Trump at the White House.
Abrams said the U.S. government had made efforts to help get the executives released, without giving details.
He also warned Moscow about its support for Maduro, hinting at potential sanctions against Russia, a day after the Trump administration called on energy companies with ties to Maduro's government to ""tread cautiously.""
""As several administration officials have noted, the Russians may soon find that their continued support of Maduro will no longer be cost-free,"" Abrams said, adding that others who profit from supporting Maduro should also heed the warning.
Russia's Rosneft, India's Reliance, Spain's Repsol (MC:REP) and U.S.-based  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) have emerged as PDVSA's main business partners since last year when the United States imposed the steepest sanctions yet on the Venezuelan state-owned company.
But following the Jan. 28, 2019 ban on U.S. companies importing Venezuelan crude, the United States has not followed through on threats to extend the sanctions to any foreign company doing business with PDVSA. Venezuela's oil exports have risen in recent months, throwing Maduro a lifeline.
Rosneft, which became the largest intermediary for Venezuelan oil last year at time when few were willing to trade it, has shown no signs of backing off.
The United States to date has not imposed sanctions on Russia or Rosneft over their support for Maduro.

Abrams on Thursday declined to discuss Washington's conversations with Rosneft, but promised more sanctions overall, without elaborating. ""We see that sanctions have had and are having significant impact and sanctions will increase,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump celebrated his acquittal on impeachment charges with a pair of caustic, freewheeling speeches on Thursday that drew on White House pomp and the solemnity of an annual prayer breakfast to underscore the fact that he remained in office.
After walking down a red carpet to a standing ovation from scores of Republican lawmakers, administration officials and conservative media figures in the East Room of the White House, Trump re-aired old grievances and accused Democrats of staging a ""corrupt"" effort to undermine his presidency in a speech lasting more than an hour. 
""I've done things wrong in my life, I will admit ... but this is what the end result is,"" Trump said, holding up a copy of the Washington Post with the headline ""Trump acquitted.""
The Republican president then handed the newspaper to his wife, Melania, and said maybe they would frame it.
Speaking without a teleprompter, he referred to the 22-month investigation by former U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller into his 2016 election campaign's possible contacts with Russia, using a profanity.
""It was all bullshit,"" he said.
The Republican-controlled Senate voted on Wednesday to acquit Trump on charges brought by the Democratic-led House of Representatives stemming from his dealings with Ukraine, only the third time in U.S. history that a president has been impeached.
The acquittal was Trump's biggest victory yet over his foes in Congress, who had attacked Senate Republicans for refusing to call witnesses or seek new evidence at the trial. 
Earlier on Thursday, Trump spoke at the annual National Prayer Breakfast, a historically bipartisan event attended by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, faulting those who invoked their religious faith during the impeachment battle.
Pelosi, a Catholic who launched the impeachment inquiry in September, said in December that she did not hate Trump and that she prayed for him. Republican Senator Mitt Romney, a Mormon, cited his faith when he voted to convict Trump on the charge of abuse of power. Romney was the only Republican to vote for conviction. No Democrat voted to acquit.
""I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong. Nor do I like people who say 'I pray for you,' when they know that that's not so,"" Trump said at the breakfast as Pelosi sat nearby on the stage.
Trump, who has strong support from evangelical Christians and conservative Catholics, referred to the issue again in the East Room: ""I doubt she (Pelosi) prays at all.""
Pelosi said that Trump's comments at the breakfast, the theme of which was ""loving your enemies,"" were inappropriate.
""He's talking about things he knows little about - faith and prayer,"" she told a news conference.
In his East Room speech, which was interrupted several times by thunderous applause and laughter from the audience, Trump called former FBI Director James Comey a ""sleazebag"" and Representative Adam Schiff, the House Democrat who spearheaded the impeachment drive, a ""vicious, horrible person."" He also reprised his attacks on 2016 Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
At the same time, he thanked dozens of Republican lawmakers by name, working alphabetically from a list.
The hyper-partisan tenor of Thursday's events did not bode well for the already sharply divided mood in Washington, especially in an election year. Trump is running for re-election in November. 
Democrats said Trump wasted an opportunity to bring the country together.
""Instead of self-victimizing and self-aggrandizing, instead of being spiteful and vindictive, President Trump could have used his nationally televised speech to show some contrition and unite the nation,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. 
NEXT STEPS?
Senate Republicans voted to acquit Trump of abuse of power for pressing Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, a contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump on Nov. 3, and of obstructing a congressional investigation of the matter.
Democrats said the acquittal did not exonerate Trump.
""No one believes he did nothing wrong,"" Senator Bob Casey told Fox News on Thursday.
Democrats were unclear, however, about their next steps in investigating Trump. There are several pending court cases related to Democratic efforts to get more information, and Pelosi has issued a statement saying the House would protect the Constitution ""both in the courts of law and in the court of public opinion.""
Several House Democrats said they should subpoena John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, to testify to House committees, but Pelosi downplayed the notion for now. Senate Republicans rejected Democratic efforts to subpoena Bolton during the impeachment trial.
Trump heads into the campaign with the advantages of a powerful fundraising machine and near universal support from Republicans. His job approval ratings have remained fairly consistent throughout his presidency and the impeachment process, as his core conservative supporters stuck with him.
The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday showed 43% of Americans supported Trump's acquittal against 41% opposed and 17% undecided, even though more respondents than not think he probably did something wrong.

According to the national poll conducted after the vote, 39% of respondents said the president ""is probably innocent of the charges against him, and the Senate made the right decision to acquit,"" while 48% said Trump ""is probably guilty of the charges against him, and the Senate is protecting him.""

Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at a hospital in Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the outbreak, was one of eight people reprimanded by Wuhan police last month for spreading ""illegal and false"" information about the coronavirus.
The Wuhan hospital where Li worked said in a statement on its Weibo account that he died at 2.58 am local time on Friday.
Li, who was 34, had told a group of doctors on Chinese social media and messaging platform WeChat that seven cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) had been confirmed linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, believed to be the source of the virus. 
He posted a picture of a test result confirming a ""SARS-like"" coronavirus in a patient sample, according to a screenshot of the WeChat conversations seen and verified by Reuters.
Li said on China's microblogging site Weibo on Feb. 1 that he had tested positive for the coronavirus.
Reuters was unable to reach Li's family for comment.
A letter to Li issued by the Wuhan police bureau on Jan. 3 said he had ""severely disrupted social order"" with his WeChat messages. 
He was asked to sign the letter as a promise to stop such illegal behaviour immediately, and if he refused to comply he would face criminal charges.
China has now reported more than 500 deaths and 26,000 cases of the coronavirus. China has vowed repeatedly to be open and transparent in dealing with the coronavirus.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau leaves for Africa on Thursday to revive what diplomats say is a faltering bid for a rotating seat on the United Nations Security Council.
Failure to win would be embarrassing for the Liberal Party leader. He came to power in November 2015 promising that ""Canada is back"" after nine years of a Conservative administration that was often suspicious of the world body and failed to win a council seat in 2010.
""The bid is not going well,"" said a diplomatic source with direct knowledge of Canada's campaign. The source requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
Canada, Ireland and Norway are vying for two seats that open up in 2021-2022. Voting will be held on June 17.
""It is a tight race; we're facing strong competition. There's a lot of work to be done,"" said a second source, who is in the Canadian government.
Trudeau will meet African leaders in Addis Ababa at the annual African Union summit before heading to Senegal.
Africa has 54 of 193 votes at the U.N., but senior Canadian government figures have largely ignored the continent since Trudeau first took office in 2015, as they focused on dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump and North American trade talks.
""Part of the reason Canada is not back is Donald Trump, pure and simple,"" said Stephanie Carvin, an assistant professor of international affairs at Ottawa's Carleton University.
Last month Canada's new Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne visited Morocco as well as Mali, where Canada had peacekeepers stationed for a year, and said he was cautiously optimistic about the bid.
Canada though spends much less of its gross domestic product on foreign aid than Norway and Ireland.
Successful campaigns also depend on lobbying envoys at the United Nations, where officials and diplomats said Canada's Ambassador Marc-Andre Blanchard was working effectively.
Several Ottawa sources said Canada strongly suspected Saudi Arabia was campaigning against the bid. Riyadh expelled the Canadian ambassador in 2018 after Ottawa urged the release of women's rights activists.
Neither the Saudi government communications office nor Trudeau's office responded to requests for comment on the Saudi position."

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canadian police imposed tighter security limits on Thursday in a remote area of northern British Columbia where indigenous protesters have blocked construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline.
The Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs said police had started to remove indigenous people from their territories.
The C$6.6 billion ($4.97 billion) pipeline, to be operated by TC Energy Corp, will move gas from northeast British Columbia to the Pacific Coast, where the Royal Dutch Shell-led LNG Canada export facility is under construction.
Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said it had imposed an ""exclusion zone"" on Thursday near Houston, B.C., that bars access to an area where project opponents had built a barricade of felled trees and incendiary materials. Police said they would allow access for some chiefs and elected indigenous officials.
The zone will create an area for Coastal GasLink contractors to safely work, RCMP said. The British Columbia Supreme Court granted an injunction in December against blockades preventing access for workers, after protests a year ago resulted in arrests.
On Wednesday, police said officers would use minimal force in any arrests to enforce the injunction. A spokeswoman said RCMP would provide an update later on Thursday.
Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs said police began ""aggressively raiding"" traditional indigenous territories overnight.
""Forcing indigenous peoples off their own territory is in complete and disgusting violation of the United Nations Declaration on the Right of Indigenous Peoples,"" Phillip said.
All of the elected indigenous band councils along Coastal GasLink's route support the company. But Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs oppose the project and say they, not the community's elected officials, hold authority over traditional lands.
Some 28% of the 670-kilometre (420-mile) route passes through Wet'suwet'en lands.
Coastal GasLink President David Pfeiffer said he was disappointed the hereditary chiefs had refused to meet with the company, and that a liaison's efforts failed to resolve the situation.
""This is not the outcome we wanted. We have made exceptional efforts to resolve this blockade through engagement and dialogue,"" Pfeiffer said.
Construction has continued along other parts of the pipeline route.

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 03:19PM ET</span>","Chemical weapons agency employees leaked information, inquiry finds","AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - An investigation commissioned by the global chemical weapons watchdog has found that two former employees leaked confidential information, it said on Thursday, a breach which fueled a Russian-backed theory that a deadly attack in Syria was staged.
More than 40 people were killed on April 7, 2018, in the town of Douma on the outskirts of Damascus that was then held by rebels but besieged by pro-government forces.
The attack triggered missile strikes by the United States, Britain and France a week later against Syrian government targets, the biggest Western military action against the Damascus authorities during the nine-year-old war.
Douma has been the source of deep division among member countries of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), with Western powers and Russia locked in political wrangling.
The government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and its military backer Russia deny using chemical weapons and accuse insurgents of staging the attack to implicate Syrian forces.
The ""deliberate and premeditated breaches of confidentiality ... are considered to be serious,"" said an OPCW statement setting out the results of the investigation, which it said was carried out by ""independent, professional investigators, from outside the organization"".
The OPCW did not name the two individuals.
The two, hailed as whistle-blowers by Russian and Syrian supporters, declined to take part in the OPCW-commissioned inquiry, the agency said. The study was based on interviews with 29 witnesses between July 2019 and February 2020.
Amid months of criticism, the OPCW has consistently stood by its findings in a March 1, 2019, report that a banned toxic chemical containing chlorine was likely used in Douma.
The Fact-Finding Mission that produced the 2019 report had not been mandated to identify perpetrators, which is the task of an ongoing study by a newly-formed OPCW team.
The OPCW asked outside experts to investigate how a document written by a former weapons inspector ended up on several websites last May. The inspector, who helped the OPCW team collect samples on a visit to Douma, wrote that two cylinders found at the scene were most likely placed there rather than being dropped from the air.
OPCW chief Fernando Arias told OPCW states in comments published on Thursday that the two individuals are ""not whistle-blowers. They are individuals who could not accept that their views were not backed by evidence.""
Arias added that most of the analytical work on Douma took place after they had already left the agency.
A joint United Nations-OPCW mission has concluded in a series of reports that Syrian government forces used banned sarin nerve gas and chlorine in the civil war, while Islamic State insurgents carried out an attack with mustard gas."

TORONTO (Reuters) - Grief-stricken relatives of passengers killed aboard an airliner shot down by Iran over Tehran last month are grappling in Canada with the daily challenges of long-distance funeral arrangements, empty homes, cars left in driveways and unpaid bills.
Iran admitted it shot down the Ukrainian airliner by mistake on Jan. 8, killing all 176 people aboard including 57 Canadians. The Canadian government said that 138 people on the flight were headed to Canada as their final destination.
Meisam Salahi's younger brother Mohsen and sister-in-law Mahsa Amirliravi were passengers who died on the flight.
Salahi, 34, wants to return his brother's car to the dealership where it was leased, deal with mortgage payments on the couple's home and collect rent from their tenants. But without a death certificate - sometimes delayed after aviation disasters as local authorities identify remains - he has struggled.
""Technically, in Canada, he's still alive,"" Salahi said. ""I don't even know how many bills I have to pay.""
Many next of kin are in Iran, giving family and friends in Canada limited power in dealing with the victims' estates. 
For Amirali Alavi, whose mother died in the crash, traveling to Iran after the crash was a trek that included a dash to Washington to get Iranian consulate paperwork, leading to a four-hour ordeal at the U.S.-Canadian border.
Alavi, 27, said he and his father were detained for questioning by U.S. border agents before he was allowed to cross at 2 a.m. His father was denied entry and returned to Canada on foot while Alavi drove on to Washington alone. It was nearly two weeks before they could bring his mother's remains back, Alavi said.
""We haven't even started to deal with the aftermath,"" Alavi added. ""These past two weeks have been really tough emotionally, and at the same time, all the work we had to do, it didn't leave us with much time to think about stuff we have to do in Canada.""
Immigration advocacy groups have criticized detentions of Iranian nationals at the U.S.-Canadian border in the aftermath of an American drone strike that killed a top Iranian general on Jan. 3.
A Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) representative declined comment on the Alavi incident, citing privacy laws, but said allegations that the agency has detained dual citizenship Iranians because of their country of origin are false. 
More than 100 Canadian government workers are assisting the families of victims connected with Canada on everything from managing DNA samples to repatriating bodies and getting legal advice and visas, said Omar Alghabra, a member of Canada's Parliament tasked with liaising with the families.
On a chilly Sunday morning last month, a mosque north of Toronto held burial services for Sahar Haghjoo, 37, and her daughter Elsa Jadidi, 8. The entrance was lined with Canadian flags.
Inside, hundreds of mourners watched photos scroll on a screen. They showed Elsa as a baby, holding one foot, and then older, kissing her father on the cheek. She held a giant ice cream cone, then a school project. A final picture showed her sitting with her mother on the plane in the last few minutes of their lives.

In tears, her grandfather Habib Haghjoo said he would not wish what happened on his worst enemy: ""This is unbearable.""

1382,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 02:49PM ET</span>","Abandoned and attacked, some Iraq protesters look to an ayatollah","By John Davison
KERBALA, Iraq (Reuters) - After followers of a populist Iraqi Shi'ite cleric who had once supported anti-government protests attacked sit-ins this week, some activists are looking to one last vestige of the establishment for support: their ayatollah.
""Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani is the only powerful figure left who can help us,"" said 30-year-old demonstrator Mahdi Abdul Zahra as he watched security forces behind concrete barriers in Baghdad take pot shots with air rifles at protesters.
""On Friday, he must call for a million-strong march against the government. It's a last chance.""
Abdul Zahra and many others have high hopes: it was Sistani's final word that forced outgoing premier Adel Abdul Mahdi to quit amid popular unrest in November. With a single edict in 2014, the country's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric also mobilized tens of thousands of men to fight Islamic State as part of Shi'ite paramilitary groups.
But as protesters watch demonstrations dwindle after followers of cleric Moqtada al-Sadr turned on them, there is a sector of young Iraqi society that is beginning to debate the importance of what Sistani says, and whether they gain from him weighing in.
""There have been countless Friday sermons on the issue now, but unfortunately nothing has happened, it's like no one is listening,"" said Ali Abboud, an activist in the holy city of Najaf - Sistani and the Shi'ite clergy's seat of power.
""When there was a edict to fight extremists, it was obeyed. But there's been no clear edict here, nothing that actually binds those in power to act.""
Sistani rarely comments on politics. But he has addressed Iraq's popular uprising, which broke out among the country's majority Shi'ite masses in Baghdad and the south in October, in almost every Friday sermon since.
The 89-year-old cleric steered clear of politics under Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein who oppressed the Shi'ite majority. But after Saddam was toppled in the 2003 U.S. invasion, Sistani emerged as one of the most powerful figures in Iraq.
WEIGHTY WORDS
His words carry weight for millions of Shi'ites, both the protesters and the Shi'ite-dominated and Iran-aligned political establishment they oppose.
Iranian-born Sistani distances himself from Tehran and disagrees with the Islamic Republic's model of state rule by a supreme cleric.
He has urged early elections, political reform and condemned the killing of nearly 500 peaceful protesters by security forces and militias that Shi'ite Iran backs.
Anti-government protesters now want him to put Sadr, whose religious pedigree comes from a Najaf family, in his place.
Sadr, who opposes foreign influence and rails against corruption but is a political opportunist, told his followers to abandon anti-government protests and clear sit-ins last week after reaching a deal with Iran-aligned parties to name Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi as new prime minister.
On Wednesday, his followers burned tents in Najaf and stormed a protest camp killing at least eight people. They stormed a Kerbala camp on Thursday wounding at least 10.
""Moqtada's followers used to protect us against militia. Now they've stolen our revolution,"" Abdul Zahra said.
Dhiaa al-Asadi, a top aide to Sadr, said the cleric had not meant for followers to attack protesters. Sadr on Twitter urged followers to clear disruptive sit-ins but continue to support peaceful protests.
'WE WON'T WAIT'
Activists lament how the moves by Sadr - one of the last figures in the political establishment whose supporters once helped them - have weakened their numbers.
On some streets and squares in Baghdad where clashes raged in recent months between security forces and protesters, market stalls go about their business selling households, toys and shiny trainers.
In southern Najaf, tents lie burned at the main sit-in. Students chant slogans against Allawi at a square in the nearby city of Kerbala, from where Sistani's Friday sermon is delivered, but in small numbers.
Protesters say Sistani should issue a harsh statement on Friday, condemning Allawi whom they reject, and Sadr for making a deal with Iran-aligned parties.
But they know the cleric is often cautious and are prepared to go on without his blessing.
""Sistani is the one leader left who's both part of the system and has supported our cause - we welcome that,"" said Hussein Sadri, an activist in Kerbala.
""But we won't just wait for him to say things to take our cue. We'll act. The uprising sprang from a young population who learn about the world online - not from clerics.""
Iraq's older generation mostly disagree, saying that Shi'ites will follow Sistani's guidance to the letter.
Mohammed al-Kaabi, a 54-year-old activist sitting with Sadri in a Kerbala cafe, said he would wait to see what Sistani said.
""If Sistani this Friday says everyone should just go home, they'll do it,"" he said."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Work on a Vatican report into disgraced ex U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick is complete and it may be released in the near future but Pope Francis will have the final word on timing, the Vatican's number two said on Thursday.
McCarrick was expelled from the Roman Catholic priesthood a year ago after a Vatican investigation found him guilty of sexual crimes against minors and adults and abuse of power.
The 89-year-old, once a power-broker as Archbishop of Washington, D.C. from 2001 to 2006, is the highest profile Church figure to have been dismissed from the priesthood in modern times.
In 2018, Francis ordered a through study of all documents in Holy See offices concerning McCarrick. The four U.S. dioceses where he served - New York, Metuchen, Newark, and Washington, D.C. - carried out separate investigations to feed into the Vatican report.
Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican Secretary of State, was asked about the status of the eagerly awaited report on the sidelines of a conference.
""I think it will come out. I can't tell you exactly when. We are trying to speed things up in order to publish it in the near future,"" said Parolin, the highest ranking person in the Church hierarchy after the pope.
""But the publication depends on the pope. The work has been done but the pope has the last word,"" he said.
There is great anticipation for the report in the United States because it may show McCarrick managed to rise through the ranks although his history of sexual misconduct with adult male seminarians was an open secret.
McCarrick's steady ascent in the U.S. Church hierarchy, with Vatican approval, came during the pontificate of Pope John Paul, which lasted from 1978 until his death in 2005.
The allegations against McCarrick, whose fall from grace stunned the U.S. Church, dated back decades.
Allegations of his abuse of minors decades ago did not surface until 2017.
But many in the United States knew of his habit of using his authority to coerce adult seminarians studying for the priesthood to sleep with him.
McCarrick, who has been living in seclusion in the United States, has responded publicly only to the allegations of abuse of minors, saying he has ""absolutely no recollection"" of them.
He has not commented on sexual misconduct with adult males."

MILAN/ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Benetton Group said on Thursday it has cut professional ties with Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind the advertising campaign that helped make it a global brand in the 1980s, over remarks he made about a 2018 bridge collapse.
The collapse of the Morandi bridge in Genoa, operated by a unit of the Benetton family-controlled infrastructure group Atlantia, claimed 43 lives.
The disaster led to heavy criticism of the Benetton family and has triggered calls from lawmakers to revoke the group's motorway concession.
During an interview with state-owned Rai radio on Tuesday, Toscani was asked for his view about members of Italy's ""Sardines"" grassroots movement - which opposes the populism of far-right Italian leader Matteo Salvini - meeting members of the Benetton family. The meeting had been widely criticised by politicians and the media due to the Benetton's involvement in the bridge tragedy.
Toscani appeared to suggest he didn't have a problem with the meeting and also said: ""Who cares if a bridge falls down?"" when asked to comment on a photograph of the Benettons with members of the Sardines.
Toscani subsequently issued a tweet saying that he was sorry about his ""extrapolated and confused words,"" adding that he was upset about the tragedy, like all Italians.
The Benetton Group and founder and Chairman Luciano Benetton said in a statement that they distanced themselves from Toscani's remarks.
""Benetton and the whole company renew their sincere sympathy towards the families of the victims and all those involved in this terrible tragedy"".
POLITICAL BACKLASH
The comments from world-acclaimed photographer Toscani sparked new criticism from leading members of Italy's ruling 5-Star Movement, the most vocal group within the ruling coalition against the Benettons and Atlantia.
Vito Crimi, leader of the 5-Star, urged the government to avoid any hesitation and push ahead in stripping Atlantia's unit Autostrade per l'Italia of its motorway concession, which accounts for around one third of its core earnings.
Toscani was also criticised by far-right League lawmaker and Genoa native, Edoardo Rixi, who for the first time signalled a possible shift in the position of his party, which in the past had adopted a less aggressive stance towards Atlantia. 
""We'll see what the government has to say (on the licence) and we'll decide"", Rixi told Reuters.
A decree passed at the end of last year made it easier and less costly for the government to cancel the valuable concession. 
The measures must be ratified by the end of February and analysts are on the watch for any signals of a softening of the final version that will be approved in parliament.
However, two government sources of the ruling centre-left Democratic party (PD) told Reuters late on Wednesday that Rome had no intention of backtracking on the legislation despite some members of the coalition remaining opposed to the new rules.
Small centrist Italia Viva party, led by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and whose support is key to maintain the government's parliamentary majority, says the decree would scare away foreign investors.
Sources from the PD say the government should use the new rules as leverage into forcing Atlantia to accept tough changes to the licence and a cut in toll-road tariffs rather than deciding on an outright revocation of the concessions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan Senate report released on Thursday criticized the Obama administration for failing to react quickly or thoroughly enough to counter Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election 
The administration ""was not well postured"" to combat the meddling and was constrained in responding by a heavily politicized environment in a volatile election year and other factors that inadvertently aided Moscow, according to the Senate Intelligence Committee's report.
The findings are significant in that minority Democrats joined majority Republicans in criticizing the Obama administration's handling of what the panel and U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was a Russian operation to sway the presidential vote to then-Republican candidate Donald Trump over his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.
Two Democrats - Ron Wyden and Martin Heinrich - took the unusual step of appending to the report separate statements charging that the report lacked critical information on the Obama administration's decision to brief only eight senior congressional leaders on the Russian meddling.
""When the country is under threat, the government has a particular responsibility to provide all relevant intelligence to the full congressional intelligence committees,"" Wyden wrote.
The report determined that high-level White House meetings on the Russian operation were “atypically” restricted to a small circle of senior aides, excluding other key officials and subject matter experts.
The decision to restrict information about the Russian operation was a major theme throughout the 49-page report, the third issued by the panel on its investigation into Moscow's vote-meddling.
""The committee found that the decisions to limit and delay the information flow regarding the 2016 Russian active measures campaign, while understandable, inadvertently constrained the administration's ability to respond,"" the report said.
Russia has denied U.S. charges that it employed cyber hacking, disinformation, and other means to influence the election outcome in Trump's favor.
A report by former Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller into the Russian operation released in April 2019 found insufficient evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow in the election interference.
In a key finding, the Senate report said that the Obama administration's response to the Russian meddling was constrained by the heavily politicized environment in the United States and fears that public warnings would undermine confidence in the election outcome, ""thereby inadvertently helping the Russian effort.""

It also found that the administration was not properly prepared to counter the Russian meddling with ""a full range of readily available policy options,"" and that the top White House national security advisors only learned of Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee's computers from news reports in June 2016.

1388,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 01:13PM ET</span>","Spain's PM meets Catalan separatist leader, sets out roadmap for talks","BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez met Catalonia's pro-independence regional leader on Thursday for the first time in over a year to outline an agenda for wider negotiations with the region that are due to kick off later this month.
The plan seeks to address Catalonia's divisive push for independence and improve relations with the region that tried to break away from Spain in 2017. The 44-item agenda puts issues ranging from taxation to decentralization on the table, although notably not the actual right to self-determination.
""On balance, the past decade has been lamentable. Nobody has won, we all have lost,"" Sanchez said after meeting with Quim Torra, head of the Catalan regional government, in Barcelona.
""What the government of Spain is proposing is a restart,"" Sanchez told reporters.
Talks between Madrid and the Catalan government were a condition set out by left-wing separatists from the Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) party, who were instrumental in facilitating Sanchez’s confirmation as prime minister last month after a months-long political stalemate.
The secessionist movement in the wealthy northeastern region plunged Spain into its biggest political crisis in decades in 2017 when Catalonia unilaterally declared independence after holding a referendum that courts had ruled illegal.
In the roadmap for the talks, Sanchez's government has agreed to consider a Catalan request for more fiscal autonomy, promised to increase infrastructure investment in Catalonia and to study ways to change the region's public financing system.
A previous round of talks on the Catalan political situation - the first since the regional government embraced a secessionist agenda in 2012 - collapsed in late 2018.
Both Sanchez and Torra said they were hopeful and willing to lead the renewed negotiating effort, but Torra said deep differences remain and Madrid's proposal was still not clear.
It was regrettable that Sanchez rejected the idea of an authorized referendum on independence and that his request to grant an amnesty to jailed and self-exiled separatist leaders went unanswered, Torra said.
""What we are requesting is that it is a frank and honest dialogue that deals with the political conflict's root,"" he told reporters.
Torra's party, Junts per Catalunya, is, along with ERC, part of a faltering pro-independence ruling coalition in the region.
Torra said last month he planned to call a snap regional election and, after meeting Sanchez, he said talks between both governments should not be affected by the electoral process. The election would be in May at the earliest.
The region saw sometimes violent protests in October after nine separatist leaders were handled long prison sentences."

BELFAST (Reuters) - Northern Irish militants hoped a bomb they planted on a haulage lorry last week would take a ferry across the Irish Sea and explode in Britain at the time it left the European Union, police said on Thursday.
Police first received a telephoned warning via a media outlet on Jan. 31 that there was a bomb in a lorry in Belfast docks which was due to go by ferry to Scotland from British-run Northern Ireland, but they could not find the vehicle.
The ferry sailed and arrived safely on the day Britain left the EU - an exit that proved highly divisive in Northern Ireland. 
On Monday, police received a second phone call, this time providing the name of the haulage company the lorry belonged to, which led them to the vehicle which had never left Northern Ireland.
""They did intend, we believe, and they said, that the device would explode at around the time the UK left the EU,"" Assistant chief Constable George Clarke told a news conference on Thursday.
The police said the bomb was planted by pro-Irish militants known as dissidents who oppose the 1998 Good Friday peace accord and have continued a low level campaign of violence.
The explosive device was found attached to a heavy goods vehicle in the Silverwood Industrial Estate in the town of Lurgan in County Armagh, Northern Ireland.
The police said the device put the driver of the vehicle, road users, and the wider public at serious risk of injury and possible death.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's president on Thursday asked outgoing Prime Minister Ludovic Orban to form a new government around the premier's centrist Liberal party, moving a step closer to an early parliamentary election which Orban is widely expected to win.
The move by Klaus Iohannis is part of a plan agreed with his centrist ally Orban to force elections six months early, in order to take advantage of the Liberal's (PNL) rising popularity and cement their grip on power for the next four years.
On Wednesday, lawmakers toppled Orban's three-month-old Liberal minority government in a parliamentary vote of no-confidence spearheaded by the opposition Social Democrats (PSD), the country's largest grouping.
Iohannis has made clear his choice would only be Orban, to be sure he gets rejected by the legislators and lead to the dissolution of parliament. 
""As I have repeatedly said, a snap poll is my first option, it is the correct choice. I decided to ask Ludovic Orban to form a new cabinet,"" Klaus Iohannis told reporters after holding consultations with parliamentary political groupings.
Parliament is considered dissolved and a snap election is held if legislators reject two successive prime minister proposals within 60 days. Pundits have said, however, the likely outcome is unclear given fragmented political groupings.
Orban's PNL has doubled its approval ratings to about 47% since a 2016 general election, while PSD's have halved to about 20% over the same period - chiefly due to its staunch attempts to weaken the judiciary. 
Analysts say the sooner Romania has a new government in command of a comfortable majority in parliament, the better will be its emerging economy, especially when considering important fiscal adjustments required this year.

A confidence vote could take place as early as next week.

PARIS (Reuters) - Christopher Lan toughed out road blocks and red tape in his scramble to get himself and his family on an evacuation flight out of the Coronavirus epicentre and home to Canada.
Lan, a biochemical engineering professor at Ottawa University, was visiting family in Hubei province with his wife and 30-year-old son when Chinese authorities put the region in lockdown in a scramble to halt the spread of the virus.
After the euphoria of finding his family's names on a Canadian government list for flight out came the chaotic journey to the airport in Wuhan.
A 4-1/2 hour drive on Wednesday afternoon, along often-deserted roads to Wuhan where citizens are living in near-quarantined conditions, ended abruptly at a roadblock 7 km (4 miles) from the airport. Police told him plans had changed; the flight was now due to leave late on Thursday.
""There was a lot of frustration, chaos, people got confused, people did not know what to do,"" the dual Chinese-Canadian national told Reuters in one of several videos he filmed as he laboured his way towards Wuhan's airport.
Lan and his family slept in their car in a parking lot as temperatures hovered near freezing.
""The temperature is not too bad,"" he said, wrapped up in heavy overcoats and wearing face-masks. ""I guess it's going to drop to close to zero or below zero. Quite an adventure!""
Lan is among 300 evacuees whom Canada aims to evacuate and quarantine at a military air base in the small town of Trenton, Ontario. The flight was still awaiting final Chinese approval.
The Coronavirus outbreak has killed 563 people and sickened some 28,000 worldwide. France, Britain, Spain and the United States and others have already evacuated some nationals from Wuhan on specially chartered flights.
Reuters lost contact with Lan before he reached the airport. Also trying to fly out was Edward Wang and his mother. He was met at the airport terminal by workers in protective hazmat suits. A desk draped in a Canadian flag had been set up by one bank of empty check-in desks.
Wang said there were insufficient seats on the Canadian flight and that he had been allocated places on a U.S. charter that was due to leave at 03:30 a.m. (1930 GMT) on Friday.
""The Americans will drop me off in Vancouver,"" he said as he collected his boarding pass. ""Then I'll continue on to Trenton."""

Six top Citgo officials in November 2017 were arrested after being called into a meeting at the Caracas office of state oil company PDVSA, which owns Citgo. They were accused of crimes including embezzlement, money laundering and conspiracy.
Washington for months has called for the release of the group, which includes naturalized U.S. citizens. A Venezuelan court in June ruled that they should stand trial, and in December they were granted house arrest.
Carlos Anez, stepson of one of the executives, said officers came to their homes on Wednesday night saying they were being taken to the Sebin intelligence service for medical exams. They have had no communication with them since.
""Police came to the apartment, told my father that they had to take him, to bring a change of clothes, they took his GPS off his ankle and took him away,"" said Anez. ""Their lawyers have not been able to speak with them.""
Alirio Zambrano, a brother of two of the jailed executives, wrote on Twitter, ""My brothers Alirio Jose and Jose Luis were taken abruptly from their house arrest last night, we demand to know their whereabouts but more importantly their freedom!""
""At this time we know that they are in the Helicoide (Sebin headquarters), all together in the same cell, even though the house arrest has not been revoked by the court,"" said Jesus Loreto, a lawyer in Venezuela representing Tomeu Vadell.
The information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Citgo acknowledged the inquiry and promised a reply shortly when asked for comment.
The group includes former Citgo vice presidents Jose Luis Zambrano, Alirio Jose Zambrano, Jorge Toledo, Tomeu Vadell and Gustavo Cardenas, and former President Jose Pereira.
In 2019 a group of 13 of the men's family members and lawyers wrote an open letter to the U.S. government asking the State Department and lawmakers to help win their release.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence then met with their family members last April.
Venezuela opposition leader Juan Guaido took control of Houston-based Citgo, the government's most profitable overseas asset, earlier this year after Washington recognized him as the country's legitimate president.
Although Guaido has the backing of the United States over 50 other countries, President Nicolas Maduro retains control of most state functions and the Venezuelan operations of PDVSA, which are under U.S-imposed sanctions."

American current affairs magazine Newsweek reported that a 57-year old U.S. contractor was abducted last week in Khost, citing unnamed U.S. officials.
The U.S. State Department declined to comment.
Newsweek reported that U.S. officials believed a Taliban-linked group, the Haqqani network, had orchestrated the abduction.
Sources close to the Haqqani network denied kidnapping the American when contacted by Reuters.
A Taliban leader who declined to be named told Reuters they had kidnapped an American in Khost but did not provide further details.
""Well to us the important achievement is the American is in our possession. We will provide other information to media later,"" he said.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters they knew of media reports of the abduction but were not aware of it and were checking with their commanders.
A senior western diplomat in Kabul said they were worried that splinter groups within the Taliban could be behind the kidnapping, highlighting worries about the group lacking unity.
The diplomat did not confirm or deny the kidnapping.
The incident comes amidst ongoing talks between the United States and the Taliban aimed at striking a deal to end their 18-year war in Afghanistan.
U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly called off the negotiations after a U.S. soldier was killed in an attack by the militant group in September.
Talks have since resumed but have suffered setbacks due to multiple attacks, including a December suicide bombing of a U.S. base outside Kabul that killed two civilians."

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 11:33AM ET</span>",Gerry Adams' successor paves potential Sinn Fein path to power in Ireland,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - For decades Sinn Fein activists insisted the star power of Gerry Adams, a former Irish Republican Army spokesman, could not be replicated among the party's Irish nationalist base.
Two years after Adams stepped down as longtime party head and in the run-up to next Saturday's national election, new leader Mary Lou McDonald is proving the power of a broader appeal.
The left-wing Sinn Fein shocked the country when it emerged as the most popular party in an opinion poll released on Monday, with 25% of support, up from 14% support in the 2016 vote. 
The party is likely running too few candidates to lead the next administration and its rivals say they will not form a coalition government with it. But McDonald, a Dublin-born politician from a middle-class background, is bringing Sinn Fein closer to its historic goal of entering government in Dublin while leading Belfast's power-sharing executive.
Many Irish voters still oppose Sinn Fein for its role as the political wing of the IRA during a decades-long fight against British rule in Northern Ireland in which some 3,600 people were killed. Adams was the face of that resistance for much of his 34 years as Sinn Fein's leader.
McDonald, 50, has opened the party up to address the concerns of a new generation that is more preoccupied with the soaring cost of housing than with Sinn Fein's ultimate aim of unifying Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In Monday's poll, the party enjoyed more support among 25-34 year olds than the century old, center-right duopoly of Fine Gael and Fianna Fail combined. It was also by some distance the first choice for those aged 35 to 49. Voters above the age of 50 still preferred the two dominant parties in Irish politics. 
""There is a really dramatic difference between how older voters view Sinn Fein and how younger voters do,"" said Una Mullally, a writer and women's rights activist. ""The other parties aren't connecting with the political desires of this generational shift."" 
McDonald has positioned herself as a ""progressive, feminist, female leader who is very much chiming with the times,"" she said.
'SHE GETS IT'
In a sign of McDonald's appeal, during a march this week by thousands of childcare workers demanding better pay, protesters cheered her name as they passed a news conference outside Sinn Fein's nearby offices - drowning out questions over a senior party figure's comments regarding a 2007 murder carried out by the IRA.
""Mary Lou appeals to me. She happens to be Sinn Fein but that's the way it is. She gets it,"" said Geraldine Travers, a 56-year-old lifelong Fianna Fail voter who is switching to Sinn Fein this time and was among the crowd.
Travers said she was less concerned about the IRA controversy that has dominated media coverage in recent days and more worried for two of her working adult children, one of whom lives at home and the other who needs help paying the rent.
Successive polls have shown voters moving to Sinn Fein over the defining campaign issue of housing. Rents in Dublin are now higher than Tokyo and Sydney, and almost 10,000 homeless people, many of them families, are stuck in temporary accommodation like hotels.
McDonald's stock has rocketed as a result, making her by far the most popular leader in Monday's Ipsos MRBI poll. A minority government led by Fianna Fail, which is running twice as many candidates, remains the most likely outcome, the poll suggested.
""I'm a good friend of Mary Lou's, she's a very decent person and that radiates. People notice that,"" said Louise O'Reilly, a senior member of the Sinn Fein front bench. ""It hasn't surprised me how popular she has become.""
ABORTION RIGHTS VOTE
Rival parties say Sinn Fein has not really changed. Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar has said it is ""not a normal party"" while Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said he could never trust its lawmakers. 
Both say the party's leadership structure allows unelected party officials to dictate policy. Sinn Fein disputes this, saying its ruling executive is no different to any other political party's governing body. 
Critics also say Sinn Fein's spending plans are too generous and reject its nationalist rhetoric.
But the party also has one foot in the political center with policies that are pro-immigration and socially progressive.
Ireland is the most pro-EU member state, and the party has dropped much of the Euroscepticism it campaigned on in 2004 when McDonald became its first member elected to the European Parliament from the Irish Republic.
However many credit McDonald's role in the 2018 referendum that voted to liberalize Ireland's abortion laws with laying the groundwork for the surge in support for both her and the party, particularly from younger voters. 
While Varadkar led the referendum campaign for the government and, as Ireland's first gay prime minister, is seen abroad as a symbol of change, McDonald may be the main beneficiary of the recent sweeping social changes in the once staunchly Catholic country.
""Mary Lou almost has fans, younger women in particular. Yes a lot of working-class women but a lot of middle-class women as well,"" said Mullally, who was also involved in the abortion rights campaign. 

""They respect her and a lot of younger women became politicized during that campaign.""

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 11:08AM ET</span>",Inquiry into London's Grenfell fire seeks protection for key witnesses,"By Estelle Shirbon
LONDON (Reuters) - A public inquiry into the fire at Grenfell Tower in London which killed 72 people is seeking a guarantee that certain witnesses will not be prosecuted over their evidence, the inquiry said on Thursday.
The 23-storey social housing block, owned by the wealthy borough of Kensington and Chelsea, was destroyed in June 2017 the worst fire in a residential building in Britain since World War Two.
The inquiry, which began in September 2017, has established that a flammable cladding system fitted to Grenfell Tower's external walls during a refurbishment was the main factor in the unstoppable spread of the fire.
Contractors involved in the refurbishment had been due to start testifying on Monday but that was postponed after some of them made a request for a guarantee that nothing they told the inquiry could be used to prosecute them.
The request outraged survivors of the fire and bereaved families, who accused the contractors of trying to sabotage the public inquiry and evade justice.
But the inquiry, led by retired judge Martin Moore-Bick, ruled on Thursday that it would grant the request and ask the attorney general, who oversees all prosecutions, to provide the guarantee, officially known as an undertaking.
The witnesses in question had known for months that they would be called to give evidence and had previously indicated they would cooperate fully.
""It is very regrettable, in our view, that the position likely to be adopted by the witnesses was not made clear months ago,"" Moore-Bick said in a ruling. ""But now that it has been raised, we have no option but to deal with it.""
POLICE INVESTIGATION
He said the inquiry's mission was to uncover the truth about the causes of the disaster and it would be harder to do so if witnesses refused to answer questions by invoking their legal right not to incriminate themselves.
The undertaking, if granted, would not amount to immunity.
It would mean that any oral evidence given to the inquiry by a witness subject to the undertaking could not be used to decide to prosecute that witness. A prosecution could still be brought, but would have to be supported by other evidence.
The oral evidence of one witness could be used in the prosecution of another.
The police, who are investigating the fire separately, have said they were considering criminal charges including gross negligence manslaughter and corporate manslaughter. They will not announce any decision until the public inquiry has ended.
Many of those affected by the fire allege that official neglect of an ethnically mixed, largely low-income community had played a part in the tragedy, and that warnings from residents that there were fire hazards in the tower had been ignored.
The Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization, which used to manage social housing in the borough and was stripped of its responsibilities after the fire, is among the bodies that have asked for the undertaking to be granted.
The request was also made by current and former employees of Rydon Maintenance Ltd, the main contractor in charge of the refurbishment, as well as by Harley Facades Ltd, a sub-contractor that dealt with the cladding.

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 10:58AM ET</span>",Aid to Houthi-controlled Yemen to be cut back over risk it can be diverted -sources,"By Lisa Barrington
DUBAI (Reuters) - The world's biggest humanitarian aid operation will be scaled-down next month in Houthi-controlled Yemen, because donors and aid workers say they can no longer ensure that food for millions of people is reaching those who need it.
Aid agency sources told Reuters Houthi authorities in northern Yemen were obstructing efforts to get food and other help to those in need, to an extent that is no longer tolerable.
""The operating environment in north Yemen has deteriorated so dramatically in recent months that humanitarians can no longer manage the risks associated with delivering assistance at the volume we currently are,"" a senior UN official said.
Unless things improve, humanitarians and donors will have ""no choice"" but to reduce assistance, the official said. This would include curtailing some food aid overseen by the United Nations World Food Program (WFP), which feeds more than 12 million Yemenis a month, 80% of them in Houthi areas.
The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's biggest humanitarian crisis and says millions of people are on the verge of starvation. There is little precedent for a such a large aid program being scaled-back in this way, which the sources called a sign of the seriousness of the concerns.
The Supreme Council for the Management and Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (SCMCHA), a Houthi body formed in November to oversee aid, did not respond to a request for comment.
Aid agencies have for the past year publicly and privately complained of worsening operating conditions, lack of travel permits and other access restrictions which have left workers in northern Yemen ""exasperated"", in the words of one agency employee, and unable to deliver to full capacity.
""At high levels this has left the agencies, NGOs and donors asking: can we continue like this or do fundamental changes need to be made?"" said another source familiar with discussions between donors and aid distributors.
Donors, U.N. agencies and charities have not publicly announced aid reductions. Two sources told Reuters cutbacks could begin at the start of March after consultation with donors this month. Two said they could begin sooner.
'NO ONE WANTS TO WALK AWAY'
Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi from the capital Sanaa in late 2014. A Saudi-led military coalition has fought to restore Hadi.
""No one wants to walk away from a crisis, certainly not a crisis as big as the one in Yemen, but humanitarians have to adjust what we are doing based on the risks we are facing,"" the U.N. official said.
Another source said discussions were ongoing about the extent of any suspension: ""Any talk of suspension needs to be carefully considered before a decision is made.""
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a major donor, said the United States was ""extremely concerned by Houthi officials' interference in aid operations"". Washington is working with donors, the United Nations and charities ""to communicate unequivocally to Houthi officials to cease their obstructive behavior"" so aid can continue, a spokesperson said. 
One of the reasons for the suspension is a dispute over a biometric system designed to record who receives aid. The WFP partially suspended food aid delivery for two months in Sanaa in June in a dispute over control of the biometric data. Eight months on, the system is still not operational in Houthi areas.
A Houthi official told Reuters WFP's demand to control the data violates Yemeni law, and the group had proposed alternative systems for aid distribution. 
U.N. documents seen by Reuters show that agencies have repeatedly asked Houthi officials over the past year to allow access and deliveries. Aid workers complain that they have been prevented not only from delivering food, but also from treating it in storage to prevent it from spoiling during delays.
In one case in the poor Hajjah district, around 2,000 tonnes of food that should have been distributed early last year is now scheduled for destruction. Permission was not granted to either distribute or treat it.

""We have seen a disturbing trend that when we inform [Houthi authorities] of the need to remove any infested stocks from the distribution centers, they arrange for media to accompany them and portray it as if WFP is distributing expired or infested food,"" one of the documents to Houthi authorities says.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's opposition leader renewed a call to have treason charges against him dropped on Thursday, saying there was no evidence to prove that he had tried to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen.
Kem Sokha was arrested in 2017 and his party banned in a crackdown by Hun Sen on the opposition, civil society groups and the media in the run-up to the 2018 parliamentary election, in which the ruling party won every seat.
Sokha, 66, is on trial charged with treason, accused of conspiring with the United States to topple Hun Sen. He denies the charges and says they are politically motivated. If convicted, he would face up to 30 years in prison.
""The charge is that it was secret collusion with foreigners, who are the foreigners?"" Sokha told reporters at his home in the capital Phnom Penh ahead of his trial on Thursday.
""There is no evidence showing my secret plans or contracts, there is none,"" he said.
""If Cambodia wants to show that this court has good reforms, that it is good and independent, it will show this by a decision to drop the charges against me because I didn't do anything wrong,"" Sokha said.
Sokha said he had received funding from U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) when he was director of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR) more than a decade ago.
""The Cambodian Center for Human Rights is a legal entity and USAID donors are legitimate, not just for CCHR, but for other organizations, including government agencies, so I believe that the court will give me justice,"" Sokha said.
In a separate news conference, the U.S Ambassador to Cambodia, Patrick Murphy, urged the government to return to a democratic path that would create a much more attractive climate for American businesses.
""We encourage Cambodia to return a strong path of multi-party democracy, respect and space for all voices, including criticism and dissent, and a healthy environment for civil society and the media, that will help Cambodia, the Cambodian people and its relations with the international community,"" Murphy said."

ROME (Reuters) - President Sergio Mattarella paid a surprise visit on Thursday to a Rome school with a large number of Chinese students, looking to dispel fears in Italy over the coronavirus, which has triggered anti-China sentiment.
Chinese businesses operating in Italy have reported a sharp drop in trade after news of the infectious virus, that originated in China, hit the headlines. Asians have reported discrimination and hostility in the streets.
""This is a wonderful surprise. Thank you,"" said Manuela Manferlotti, the headmistress of the Daniele Manin Elementary School in the Esquilino neighbourhood as the president entered a classroom.
""We were just talking about this very topical issue of friendship, peace and inclusion.""
While Mattarella made no direct reference to the virus, a source in his office said he wanted to send a very clear message by visiting a school with a large migrant intake.
""This was an effort to sooth anxiety and show friendship towards China,"" the source said.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also denounced on Thursday any prejudice and hostility arising from the coronavirus.
""Discriminating against the Chinese, against Chinese children, as is happening in some classrooms, is absolutely stupid,"" he said on the sidelines of a conference on bullying.
More than 560 people have died from the virus in mainland China, while there have been more than 28,000 confirmed infections around the world, including two Chinese tourists who are in quarantine in Italy.
About 310,000 Chinese nationals live in Italy, according to government statistics, while an estimated three million Chinese tourists visited the country in 2018.
Italy last week declared a six-month state of emergency over the illness and banned all flights to and from China in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus. But it has failed to contain knee-jerk, anti-Chinese sentiment.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's health authorities on Thursday encouraged people to make hand sanitizers and masks at home to guard against the spread of the new coronavirus.
Thailand, which has reported a total of 25 cases, put surgical masks and sanitizers under its list of controlled goods earlier this week, as the spread of the flu-like virus led to shortages in stores.
Due to lack of supply, health authorities demonstrated how to make sanitising liquids during a televised news conference.
""If you can't find hand sanitizers in stores, make it yourself. Mix clean water with alcohol and carry it wherever you go,"" said Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul at the conference.
""We have to protect ourselves against the virus. Eat hot food, use serving spoons, wear masks, wash your hands.""
On Thursday, Thailand started enforcing price control measures on surgical masks and hand sanitizers, amid scarce supplies in drug stores.
As a result, anyone selling overpriced masks and sanitizers faces punishment of up to seven years in jail or up to 140,000 baht ($4,507.41) in fines.
People are allowed to buy up to 10 masks with each purchase, and anyone exporting more than 500 masks per shipment must also obtain permission from trade authorities first.
Early on Thursday, Thais lined up outside a government pharmacy to stock up before sales started in the afternoon.
Many said they wanted to buy as much as they could due to fears of the virus outbreak, but could only buy 10.
""This isn't really enough, but it's good to have just in case,"" said Chalida Potpanitpong, 65.
To ease the shortages, the Thai government started handing out 45,000 surgical masks for free from Thursday to Saturday at different ""risky"" locations, mostly tourist areas, in Bangkok.
It will also start selling millions of masks from Saturday onwards through government-sponsored stores across the country.
The 25 cases of the new coronavirus reported in Thailand include 16 Chinese and nine Thais. Nine have recovered enough to go home, while the rest remain in the hospital."

CONCORD, N.H. (Reuters) - The road to victory in New Hampshire’s critical Democratic primary on Tuesday may run through the living rooms of people like Gerri and Ron King. 
On a recent weekend, the couple baked berry souffles and roasted a ham as they welcomed friends and strangers to their Concord home to hear from Democratic presidential candidate Deval Patrick.
A New Hampshire political tradition known as the house party is an unfiltered and intimate affair that more closely resembles a family gathering than a campaign stop. 
The Kings have been hosting parties for more than 15 years. This election, they've brought in at least 12 Democratic presidential candidates, including former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and U.S. Senator Cory Booker, who has since dropped out of the race. 
New Hampshire's house party culture represents a nod to a simpler time, running contrary to the huge rallies, million-dollar ad buys and social media blitzes that define modern politics.
It has its roots in the state's first-in-the-nation primary, where candidates frequent the state’s diners, gymnasiums and bookstores in the months before the vote.
With muddled and incomplete Iowa caucus results showing Buttigieg with a narrow lead over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, New Hampshire's primary takes on added importance. 
""They have to face tough questions and show their personality. We quickly find out whether a candidate is all hat and no ranch,"" said Dick Henry, a 72-year-old energy consultant who routinely attends house parties.
Even though Patrick, a former governor of neighboring Massachusetts, has barely registered in opinion polls, roughly 50 people poured into the Kings' house for his event. The guests found seats on couches and on the stairs, sipping coffee and eating the mounds of food laid out in the dining room.
The crowd had been so big for Buttigieg, Gerri King said, that his staff had to move furniture into the garage and turn away guests.
In their own way, house parties can make or break a candidate. 
Marsha Mackey, a 72-year-old retired teacher, said she had been a fan of former Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke but changed her mind after seeing him in a small setting.
""He was too wooden, too calculated. I really lost interest in him after that,"" Mackey said. 
The first presidential house party the Kings hosted was for then-Vermont Governor Howard Dean during the 2004 presidential campaign. Dean was such an unknown that when the candidate showed up at their door, the couple didn't recognize him.
Momentos of past visits adorn the couple's walls, with former President Barack Obama occupying the most space. The Kings said Obama represents the perfect example of the power of the house party.
""Before he came, he had a reputation of being cold, but he was so warm and it really showed. He had been to six events that day and had to fly back to Chicago, but he angered aides by making sure he stayed around to say hello to everyone,"" said Gerri King, 77.

Tebboune, elected in December in a vote rejected by a mass protest movement seeking the total replacement of the ruling elite, is trying to quell nearly a year of political unrest.
The mass pardons this week follow an offer of dialogue with the protesters, the release of detainees arrested at demonstrations, the formation of a committee to amend the constitution and meetings with opposition figures.
Combined with the 3,471 prisoners released earlier this week, Tebboune has now pardoned nearly 10,000 prisoners with sentences of 18 months or less.
His predecessor, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who ruled for 20 years until he was ousted in April over the mass protests, freed about 5,000 people in 2017 to mark Algeria's independence day.
OPEC member Algeria also faces economic problems and increased financial pressure caused by a fall in energy revenue and foreign exchange reserves.
Protesters have been taking to the streets for weekly demonstrations on Fridays, but their number appears to have fallen since Tebboune's election."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - In a nation unaccustomed to widespread working from home, China's coronavirus epidemic is forcing millions of white-collar workers to get used to business outside the office.
With millions of companies keeping staff away to curb contagion, demand is surging for chat apps that employees are adjusting to use from living rooms, kitchens and home offices.
""When we did our first video call on Monday, some people looked like they just got out of bed,"" said Jingshu Chen, who runs virtual reality startup VeeR, which asked its staff to stay away from their Beijing office for the week.
""Then, when we did a video call on the second day, everyone looked ready to work.""
Provinces across China have ordered companies to shut or make staff work from home for at least another week after the Lunar New Year holiday. Many firms may extend that further.
The work-from-home policies have led to a surge in downloads for WeChat Enterprise, DingTalk, and Lark - three workplace chat apps operated by Tencent,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), and ByteDance respectively.
According to data from research firm App Annie, both DingTalk and Lark saw downloads across China's app stores surge over 350% during Chinese New Year week compared to one week prior.
Downloads for WeChat Work surged by almost 70% in the same time.
Both DingTalk and WeChat Work suffered connectivity issues due to heavy usages, the companies confirmed in public statements addressing user complaints.
COURIERS AND ROUND-THE-CLOCK
Companies are also relying more on China's army of couriers, who are keeping many self-quarantined residents fed and supplied. VeeR's Chen said large video files her team once accessed on an office network are now delivered to employees' homes via hard drives with couriers.
Some fear financial disruptions.
John Rood, who runs a digital marketing agency in Shenzhen, said the nationwide work-from-home experiment could cause late payments from clients due to banking system quirks.
""A lot of Chinese banks require you to use a USB drive to log into your account, for security measures,"" he said.
""But if the financial departments didn't bring the USB drive home before the holiday, our payments will probably be delayed another week.""Others said they felt pressure to be online 24/7 as there was no means of clocking off as normal now.
One client manager at HSBC bank said the work-from-home policy has her feeling she cannot leave the house lest she miss a message in her department group chat.
""Your boss is in the group, so you need to be as fast as everyone else,"" she said."
1414,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 07:49AM ET</span>","About 500,000 EU citizens yet to apply for UK residency after Brexit","LONDON (Reuters) - An estimated 500,000 European Union nationals in Britain have yet to apply for a new immigration status, which most will need to remain in the country after Brexit.
The government is introducing the biggest shake-up of Britain’s border controls in decades, ending the priority given to EU migrants over those from other countries after leaving the bloc last week.
Government statistics show that 3 million EU citizens and their family members have applied for ""settled status,"" a form of permission from the government to remain in Britain.
The figures underline the large number applications for the scheme, which was launched nationally in March last year, but also the challenge ahead for the government to ensure all EU citizens correctly apply.
Interior minister Priti Patel said she was pleased with the response and urged EU members to put the same effort into guaranteeing the status of British nationals living in their countries beyond Brexit.
""It's the biggest scheme of its kind in British history and means that EU citizens can evidence their rights for decades to come,"" she said. ""It’s now time for EU countries to adopt a similar scheme.""
An estimated 3.5 million European citizens live in the United Kingdom and they have until at least the end of the year to apply for settled status.
But lawyers say many EU citizens lawfully in the country could fall through the net and face losing their rights to benefits such as healthcare.
Of the applications so far processed, 58% were granted settled status - a permanent right to remain - and 41% were given pre-settled status, which gives them temporary permission to stay and the chance to reapply after five years.
The European parliament raised concerns last month that EU citizens risked discrimination after Brexit in seeking housing and employment.
Worries about the future of its citizens in Britain after Brexit have increased since security minister Brandon Lewis said that EU nationals risked being deported if they failed to apply for settled status."
1415,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 07:03AM ET</span>",Palestinian and Israeli farmers pay the price as politicians bicker,"By Adel Abu Nimeh and Rami Amichay
JERICHO, West Bank/BE'ER TUVIA, Israel (Reuters) - Israel and the Palestinian Authority have opened a new front in their decades-long conflict by getting locked in a trade dispute - and farmers on both sides of the border are paying the price.
Palestinian Mowafak Hashim, who farms fruit and vegetables in sun-baked Jericho in the occupied West Bank, says he supports moves by the Palestinian Authority (PA) to end imports of Israeli agricultural products.
But he also fears the breakdown in a usually smooth-running cross-border trade relationship will ruin his business.
""I won't find alternative markets... since the (Israeli) occupation controls the checkpoints"", said the 51-year-old, referring to Israel's control over the West Bank's border crossings.
The PA announced a boycott of Israeli calves in October. Last weekend Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett said he would halt all PA agricultural imports, which in turn prompted the PA to say it would end imports of Israeli agricultural products, fruit juice and bottled water.
Those tit-for-tat moves have frayed trade links that have generally held strong since the two sides signed interim peace accords in the 1990s, even weathering the collapse in 2014 of peace negotiations. 
The actions of the PA, whose power base is in the West Bank, in part reflect greater efforts to end what its leaders - including new Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh - see as an over-dependence on Israeli markets.
A second Palestinian farmer, 54-year-old Hisham Qutaishat, concurs with that approach. 
""The PA should start a comprehensive national and strategic plan to connect the needs of the Palestinian market to what Palestinian farmers produce,"" he said. 
""That way, we will not fall victims to any (Israeli) decision like this in the future.""
But in the meantime, with the announcement of U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan further fuelling bilateral tensions, producers on both sides are suffering.
The West Bank currently sends over two-thirds of its farming exports to Israel, whose agriculture ministry says the calves boycott has affected around 400 Israeli cattle breeders, costing them a total of $70 million since October.
In Be'er Tuvia, a southern Israeli agricultural village, cattle farmer Guy Golan said he sells around 400 calves annually to the Palestinian market, earning him 2.5 million shekels ($725,000).
""This boycott hurts our business very, very much ... The cows go on and give birth, and the young calves, they're not able to go anywhere,"" Golan said. 
""We can't buy and we can't sell, everything is stuck."".

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Victims of defective breast implants made by French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) may only get compensation if they had the procedure in France, an adviser at Europe's top court said on Thursday, in a potential blow to thousands of women worldwide.
The opinion by Advocate General Michal Bobek at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) came after a German patient sought compensation from PIP's French insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) IARD in a German court for faulty breast implants.
The PIP scandal, which emerged in 2010, affected about 300,000 women in some 65 countries worldwide. The company filled its implants with unauthorized industrial silicone instead of medical silicone. It shut down in 2010.
""The civil liability insurance of breast implant producer PIP could validly be limited to women who underwent surgery in France,"" Advocate General Michal Bobek said in his non-binding opinion on Thursday.
Bobek said that it was for EU countries to regulate insurance policies relating to medical devices used on their territory even if they were imported from another member state.
PIP founder Jean-Claude Mas was jailed for four years and fined 75,000 euros ($82,522.50) in 2013 after a police investigation revealed a sophisticated fraud.
The court, which will issue its ruling in the coming months, usually follows the opinions of its advisers in four out of five cases.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Anwar Ibrahim said on Thursday he was ready to wait for six more months beyond the initially agreed May deadline to take over as prime minister from Mahathir Mohamad, and that he had enough support in parliament to do so.
Mahathir led the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, or Alliance of Hope, to a stunning victory in a general election in May 2018, joining hands with former enemies including Anwar to bring down Najib Razak, who is facing multiple charges of corruption mostly linked to the looting of sovereign fund 1MDB.
Mahathir had promised to hand over the premiership to Anwar within two years of the general election result, but later said he would stay on until at least November to host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November.
The 94-year-old also said Anwar would have to secure parliamentary majority to become prime minister.
""You've waited 20 years, extending six months doesn't actually matter,"" Anwar told Reuters at his private office, expressing confidence that the coalition allies would stand behind him, as they did for Mahathir.
""If there's a request to go back to parliament, of course it can be done, but PH has the majority right now. Even those who are not in PH, some would support the PM of the day. I also have been given that assurance. They support Mahathir as the PM, and they will continue to support me when I assume the premiership.""
Anwar had served as deputy prime minister and finance minister during Mahathir's first 22-year stint in office, but was sacked in 1998 after falling out with Malaysia's ""Old Man"" over how to defend the economy against the Asian Financial Crisis.
Going into opposition, Anwar quickly drew support from a large section of Malay Muslims, the multi-cultural country's dominant ethnic group, to form the Reformasi movement, before being jailed a year later on corruption and sodomy charges that he said were politically motivated.
In the years following his release, Anwar rebuilt his following and came close to defeating Najib, another Mahathir protege, in the disputed 2013 general election. Two years later, he was jailed, once again on sodomy charges that he denied.
He was released on a royal pardon soon after Najib lost power in the 2018 election.
In total, Anwar had spent close to 10 years in prison as a result of the two convictions.
But controversy continued to dog the 72-year-old, after a former aide last year accused him of trying to force him to have sex in September 2018. The solicitor-general last month ruled out pressing charges against Anwar over the allegations, which the politician described as ""politics at its worst"".
Same-sex acts are illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia, and carry penalties of up to 20 years in jail if convicted.
""Of course I have many political foes. The corrupt few will do whatever it takes to ensure that I do not assume office,"" said Anwar, dressed in a casual blue chequered-shirt.
BURIED HATCHET
The protracted feud between Mahathir and Anwar, the country's two most charismatic politicians, has dominated Malaysian politics for decades.
Since his release, Anwar has stayed out of government, biding his time while his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail has served as deputy prime minister to Mahathir.
Anwar said he was ready to move on from the bitter past, and that he would be willing to carve out space for Mahathir to continue to contribute after he takes over as prime minister.
""His presence in a way... would certainly help boost the general confidence and give some sort of semblance of stability and order,"" Anwar said, using Mahathir's honorific.
""There will be no real drastic policy difference. There would be different emphasis, of course, but on a personal basis, I certainly welcome very much his presence and contribution in any way.""
He would, however, look to mend soured ties with India after Mahathir's criticism of New Delhi's two recent policies led to a massive fall in palm oil trade between the countries.
One thing that will not change is Malaysia's demand for reparations from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) over its role in the multibillion-dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), Anwar said.
He repeated Mahathir's position that the U.S. bank's initial settlement offer of over $1 billion was too small, but declined to say how much he felt was sufficient compensation.
""Certainly the amount has to be substantial, because we're looking not only at the loss of dollars, but the loss of reputation, investments, and the perception about Malaysia,"" Anwar said.
Goldman has said it is discussions with authorities on a possible resolution of investigations relating to 1MDB."

The ICC, the world's first permanent war crimes court, acquitted Gbagbo on crimes against humanity charges on Jan. 15, saying prosecutors had failed to prove any case against him.
He was then conditionally released from detention after more than seven years in custody to Belgium. He was not allowed to return to Ivory Coast and has to remain in Belgium and report to the court whenever a hearing in his case is called.
""The defense is of the view that in principle no restriction should be placed on a person who has been acquitted,"" Gbagbo's lawyer Dov Jacobs told the court.
The defense has indicated that Gbagbo would like to return to Ivory Coast and possibly participate in some form in October's presidential election. Gbagbo has not said whether he intends to run again for the presidency.
Ivory Coast's government has submitted arguments to the ICC saying Gbagbo's possible return to the country could cause unrest and that he continues to pose a flight risk.

Mahathir has also angered India by accusing it of invading and occupying Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region whose autonomy New Delhi took away last year, and is disputed by Pakistan.
Anwar, who expects to succeed the 94-year-old Mahathir later this year under a deal worked out with his former foe, said the Malaysian leader may have gone beyond diplomatic expressions of concerns in his condemnation of the Indian government.
""Countries will not take strong objections when you express concern, but of course in this regard Tun Mahathir has been quite tough and strong,"" Anwar said in an interview, using an honorific for the premier.
""But since then in the past few weeks, he has tried his level best to contain and try to make the necessary adjustments. I'm sure the leaders in India will take cognisance of the fact that Mahathir did say it, but then he has now refrained from repeating it in the sayings or tone.""
Anwar said he and Mahathir had discussed the tension with New Delhi and that it was important to maintain good economic and trade relations with countries like India and China without necessarily having to agree with each other's policies.
Anwar said he would have crafted any criticism of India over Kashmir or the new citizenship law differently than Mahathir.
India's January imports of Malaysian palm oil may have plunged 80% from a year earlier to 40,400 tonnes, according to Refinitiv. India bought 4.4 million tonnes of Malaysian palm oil last year, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Council.
India's arch-enemy Pakistan, meanwhile, has pledged to buy more palm oil from Malaysia to help offset lost sales to India.
Pakistan may have bought around 135,000 tonnes of Malaysian palm oil last month, a record high, India-based dealers who track such shipments told Reuters on condition of anonymity."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Senior figures in Germany's governing coalition will hold crisis talks on Saturday in response to growing outrage after a state premier was elected with support from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives.
The election of Thomas Kemmerich, a little-known liberal Free Democrat (FDP) in the eastern state of Thuringia, was the first in which a state premier won with the support of the AfD, shattering the post-war consensus among established parties of shunning the far right.
In a move that outraged her Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners, Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) sided with the AfD.
Leading members of the crisis-prone national coalition - forged between Merkel's conservatives and the SPD out of necessity in 2018 - are due to meet at the weekend to discuss the situation.
""On the initiative of the SPD, the coalition committee is to meet on Saturday,"" SPD national leader Norbert Walter-Borjans said late on Wednesday.
The SPD has strongly criticized the election of Kemmerich.
""'Sinful and shameful' - Germany as a whole risks being damaged unless there are new elections in Thuringia,"" Sigmar Gabriel, a former SPD leader, said on Twitter on Thursday.
Alexander Dobrindt, a senior figure in the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) - the sister party to Merkel's CDU - told regional newspaper Augsburger Allgemeine that Kemmerich's election was ""a grave mistake"" and that the logical consequence would be to hold a new election in Thuringia.
CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer had already called on Wednesday for a new vote in Thuringia.
The CDU and all the other established parties have previously ostracized the AfD over what they say are racist views held by some of its members.
The SPD is unlikely to desert Merkel's national coalition over the vote in Thuringia but analysts said it would be seen as a test of her authority."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - At a Buddhist temple south of Bangkok, a monk watches as a machine presses down on thousands of water bottles, before a giant bale of crushed plastic rolls out with a thud.
The plastic is destined to be recycled into polyester fibers, which will be made into fabric for saffron-colored robes for monks.
The recycling temple of Wat Chak Daeng is one bright example of recycling for Thailand, one of five countries that account for more than half of plastic in the world's oceans.
The monks have crushed 40 tonnes (88,185 lb) of plastic over two years since starting the program, aiming to curb plastic waste entering the Chao Phraya River, which flows south to the Gulf of Thailand in the western Pacific Ocean.
""I'm practicing the Buddha's teachings, which also align with solving the global environmental crisis,"" says Phra Maha Pranom Dhammalangkaro, 54, abbot of the temple in Samut Prakan province, just south of Bangkok.
Unlike most temples where people give monks alms like food and clothes, devotees ride bicycles here to offer plastic bags and bottles in exchange for Phra Maha Pranom's blessings.
""Donating one kilogram (2.2 lb) of plastic bottles can help make a full set of monk robes, which has a high return value, both in terms of money and merits,"" the monk says.
The temple has produced at least 800 sets of robes, with more in production stages.
Each set sells for between 2,000 baht ($65.79) and 5,000 baht ($164.47), to keep funding the project and pay waste-sorting volunteers, many of whom are local housewives, retirees and disabled persons.
Thailand is the fifth highest contributor of plastic to the world's oceans, according to a report by the U.S.-based group Ocean Conservancy. The list includes three other Southeast Asian countries and China, the top plastics polluter.
""Not only are the monks making a concrete contribution to recycling, but they are raising awareness in their communities,"" said Chever Voltmer, Director for Plastics Initiatives at Ocean Conservancy.
When Phra Maha Pranom ventures into the community, villagers, both young and old, come out to contribute plastics.
""If you don't collect these plastics, where do they end up? In the stomachs of dugongs, dolphins, whales, and many other sea animals. Then they die,"" he tells them."

Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, 42, apologized for what he said was foolish behavior.
""I have behaved foolishly and I am truly sorry,"" Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said in a statement. ""I apologize unreservedly to the individual involved and his family.""
""Serving in government has been a huge privilege and I am sorry to have let colleagues and supporters down,"" he added.
The Sun newspaper reported that Mackay, seen as a potential leader of Scotland, had sent about 270 messages to the boy on Instagram over a six-month period, telling the boy that he was ""cute"" and inviting him to dinner.
Mackay had been due to deliver the Scottish government's annual budget on Thursday, when the report came out on the front page of the Sun's Scottish edition.
He said that he spoke to Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and resigned last night.

Government forces backed by air strikes had on Wednesday encircled and entered Saraqeb, 15 km (9 miles) east of Idlib city, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had said in a report corroborated by witnesses.
The town lies at the junction of two main roads that President Bashar al-Assad seeks to fully control under the campaign to regain Idlib province, the last rebel bastion in the nearly nine-year-long civil war.
On another front, Syrian air defenses intercepted Israeli missiles over Damascus early on Thursday that were fired at military targets in southern Syria including near the capital, the defense ministry said.
The swift advance toward Idlib city has caused a new exodus of thousands of civilians toward the border with Turkey, which backs some insurgent groups fighting Assad.
Rebel fighters ""managed to push back government forces from most of Saraqeb in an attack from the northern part of the town that coincided with Turkish shelling against advancing government forces,"" the Observatory said.
Witnesses said government forces came under shelling from Turkish observation posts in the area.
The renewed fighting is taking place despite a Jan. 12 ceasefire agreement between Turkey and Russia, which back opposing sides of the conflict.
Shelling by Syrian government forces killed eight Turkish military personnel on Monday, prompting Turkish forces to strike back.
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan threatened on Wednesday to drive back Syrian troops in Idlib unless they withdraw by the end of the month to stem an assault which he said had displaced nearly 1 million people.
The attacks by Israeli warplanes were launched over the Golan Heights and Lebanese air space in two waves, one near Damascus and another near Deraa and Quneitra provinces, the Syrian defense ministry said.
The Syrian air defenses downed a large number of missiles but the attack had caused material damage and injured eight ""fighters"", without specifying their nationality, it said.
The Israeli military declined to comment.
Israel has repeatedly bombed Iranian-backed militia targets in Syria, saying its goal was to end Tehran’s military presence there, which Western intelligence sources say has expanded in recent years."

Video from the scene showed that the front engine and at least one passenger wagon had skipped the tracks, flipping onto their side. Photographs suggested the engine had broken clear of the rest of the train and smashed into an adjacent building.
The head of Italy's civil protection unit said the two dead were the train drivers. A further 27 people were hurt, but none had life-threatening injuries. 
""There shouldn't be any more deaths,"" the government representative in Lodi, Marcello Cardona, told reporters at the scene, adding it was lucky the toll hadn't been higher. 
Officials said only 33 people had been aboard the early morning train, which had left Italy's financial capital Milan at 5.10 a.m. (0410 GMT) and was heading to the southern city of Salerno. 
It derailed at Livraga 20 minutes into its trip, some 40 km (25 miles) from Milan.
Italy's state railways said it was investigating the accident. High speed trains from the south were having to stop at the northern city of Bologna, while morning services out of Milan were cancelled.

In a separate incident, Israeli troops killed a Palestinian during clashes in the occupied West Bank. 
The Jerusalem car-ramming took place on David Remez Street, which is close to the Arab neighborhoods of eastern parts of the city that Palestinians want for a state. A theater and late-night restaurants and bars are also located along the street. 
A military spokeswoman said the soldiers were touring the city, where they had come to be sworn in after basic training.

The three men were stabbed on Tuesday night in Hulhumale, an island seven kms (four miles) north of capital city Male, police said on Twitter.
One of the Chinese nationals was a tourist and the two others worked in the city. They were in stable conditions in hospital, police added.
Chinese and Australian embassy officials were not immediately available to comment.
A Maldivian radical group affiliated with Islamic State had taken responsibility for the attack in a video posted online, local media reported on Wednesday.
One of the three masked men seen in the video accused the Maldivian government of being run by infidels and warned more such attacks were coming.
Police said they were working to confirm the veracity of the video.

The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) issued severe thunderstorm warnings for the southeast Queensland state and a flood alert for more than 20 areas in New South Wales (NSW) after the start of heavy rainfall that is expected to continue for several days.
Cricket Australia said a bushfire fundraising match which was set to be played in Sydney on Saturday had to be rescheduled for Melbourne on Sunday because of the rain. 
Warm, moist air feeding in from the east was bringing the rain, BOM forecaster Mike Funnell told the Australian Broadcasting Corp .
""We are expecting those larger totals and heavier rainfall to come into the northeast coast of NSW and then sort of track slowly southwards.""
A tropical low off the Kimberley coast in Western Australia state was forecast to develop into a category three cyclone that could hit the Pilbara region, Australia's iron ore producing heartland, on Saturday.
The wet weather has helped douse or slow some of the country's most damaging and long-running wildfires, which have burned through more than 11.7 million hectares (2.8 million acres) of land since September. The prolonged bushfire season has killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals. More than 2,500 homes have been destroyed.
Officials, however, have warned the threat was not yet over and that there will likely be weeks more of firefighting ahead.

Around 60 fires were still burning across NSW and Victoria, the country's most populous states, with around half of those classified as uncontained.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 12:16AM ET</span>",India's divisive protests could help Modi's party in election test,"By Alasdair Pal and Devjyot Ghoshal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party this week face their first electoral test since deadly anti-government protests erupted nearly two months ago, with the divisive turmoil likely to win them votes at polls in the capital.
Modi's Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a bigger majority in a general election in May, but it has lost a string of state elections since then.
The protests, in which at least 25 people have been killed, erupted across the country in mid-December, after the BJP passed a new citizenship law critics say violates India's secular constitution and discriminates against minority Muslims.
New Delhi is due to hold its elections on Saturday with tension high after three incidents of gunfire at or near protest sites in four days. In two of the shootings, people shouted Hindu-nationalist slogans.
Protest organizers have stepped up security as a result, and blame the BJP for inflaming the tension. The party denies doing so.
Without a well-known leader in the capital, analysts say the BJP has intensified a policy of campaigning on Modi's personal appeal, rather than on development issues.
At the same time, the protests have highlighted the communal fault line, which could help his party secure the Hindu vote in the capital and elsewhere, analysts say.
""Rightly or wrongly, they are largely seen as Muslim protesters. There is a polarization between Hindus and Muslims that suits the BJP,"" said Harsh Pant, a fellow at New Delhi-based think-tank the Observer Research Foundation.
The BJP's main challenger on Saturday will be the liberal Aam Aadmi Party, led by the city's chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal.
It has focused on its work over the last five years, such as fixing state-run schools and healthcare in the city of more than 16 million people.
The BJP, however, has highlighted the work of Modi's federal government since its re-election last May, in particular changes that have appealed to the party's Hindu base such as reforms in the disputed Kashmir region and a court ruling, backed by the government, clearing the way for the construction of a Hindu temple on a long-disputed site in northern India.
""What they seem to be doing is fighting state elections on Modi's popularity,"" Pant said.
Other issues, such as Delhi's woeful air pollution, have not figured prominently in the election although all main contenders promise to tackle it.
PLEASING PAKISTAN?
In Shaheen Bagh, a working-class, majority-Muslim area of southeast Delhi, protesters have blocked a major road for months, demanding the repeal of the citizenship law. 
In neighborhood meetings, election rallies and road shows snaking through narrow streets, BJP workers and leaders have focused on the site, attempting to discredit the protesters and sometimes going as far as to accuse them of being aligned with Muslim-majority arch-rival Pakistan.
Polling data for Delhi shows the BJP narrowing the gap with - but still trailing - the Aam Aadmi Party over the past week.
BJP leaders have called Kejriwal a ""terrorist"", and accused protesters of being rapists.
""Pakistan will be pleased if you vote for Kejriwal,"" a leader of the BJP’s women's wing, Sukhpreet Kaur, told an election gathering of about 100 women in the working-class Delhi neighborhood of Mayapuri on Tuesday.
Yogi Adityanath, a firebrand Hindu monk and BJP chief minister of India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, which flanks Delhi in the east, mentioned Pakistan eight times in 48 seconds in a speech in Delhi this week. 
BJP worker Indushekhar Mishra said the tide was turning in his party's favor with the help of the protests.
""The main issue is the Shaheen Bagh problem,"" he told Reuters, ahead of a road show in central Delhi by India’s Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday. 
""People have understood that the other party supports one community.""
Shaheen Bagh has been tense since a Hindu gunman shot and wounded a protester at a nearby university on Jan 30. 
Its narrow lanes have been cordoned off and anyone entering is carefully searched.
""The BJP has poisoned the atmosphere,"" Afsal Ahmed Khan, one of the protest organizers, told Reuters. 

""They're trying to win the election without addressing any issues, by making it about Hindus and Muslims. But people will not go back to their homes until the government removes these discriminatory laws.""

MAEBASHI, Japan (Reuters) - Abraham Majok, a South Sudanese 1,500m runner training in Japan for the Tokyo Olympics, aims to bring back two things to his war-torn country after the Games: an Olympic medal and a message on the importance of peace.
Majok and three other South Sudanese athletes have been training in the central Japanese city of Maebashi, 100 km (62 miles) northwest of Tokyo, since November for this summer's Olympics and Paralympics.
""The Olympics, according to my own understanding, is a game of peace, and it happens because the world is at peace ... I have come here and seen the advantages of peace in other countries,"" Majok, 20, told Reuters.
""So, when I get back (to South Sudan), the message I will have is the importance of peace,"" he added. ""That is the biggest message I will say to my people.""
South Sudan, the world's youngest country, gained independence from Sudan in 2011 but descended into a civil war two years later. The conflict has killed an estimated 400,000 people and forced millions from their homes.
President Salva Kiir and former rebel leader Riek Machar signed a peace deal in 2018 but are still struggling to form a united government. 
Majok said that the civil war has not ""physically or directly"" affected his family, but that everyone in the country had struggled with high inflation brought about by the conflict.
""Things became very expensive in the market, and life became very hard ... Sometimes you cannot manage to afford and buy whatever you need in the daily life. So, it actually affected everybody,"" he said.
South Sudan is one of the world's poorest countries, with per-capita gross domestic product likely to have come to $275.2 in 2019, or less than 0.3 percent of that of top-ranked Luxembourg, according to International Monetary Fund estimates.
Proper athletic facilities hardly exist, and basic gear such as hurdles are hard to come by, Majok and other South Sudan athletes said.
Besides Majok, the South Sudan team is made up of 400m hurdles runner Akoon Akoon; 100m sprinter Lucia Moris, the group's only woman; Paralympian 100m sprinter Michael Machiek; and coach Joseph Omirok. 
In a bid to help them beat the odds and foster much-needed sense of South Sudanese national unity through sports, the city of Maebashi last year decided to host the athletes' training camp through the Games. 
The athletes have practice runs five days a week in an athletic field or on the road with Japanese training mates and volunteer coaches. They also attend a Japanese-language class, and occasionally visit the city's elementary and junior high schools to meet students.
Last month, they even participated in a traditional community event, in which they pounded steamed rice with giant mallets into rice cakes. 
To cover an estimated 20 million yen ($182,116) necessary to pay for the athletes' expenses, the city is collecting donation, a citizen's group is selling T-shirts, and residents are volunteering as interpreters.
""It is worth doing if a rural city like ours can help build peace of a country,"" said Kazuhiko Kuwabara, head of the municipal government's sport division.
Asked which side he would support if a Japanese athlete competes with a South Sudan rival at the Tokyo Games, he said, ""I would cheer both ... well, maybe South Sudan.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday stepped up warnings to Russia over its Syria policy, saying Moscow was trying to challenge the U.S. presence in northeastern Syria by violating the terms of a de-confliction agreement and was also helping escalate the fighting in the northwestern province of Idlib.
James Jeffrey, U.S. special envoy for Syria engagement and fight against Islamic State, said the United States was ""very very worried"" about the Syrian government assault, backed by Russia, on Idlib, and he repeated calls on Moscow to stop it.
""This is a dangerous conflict. It needs to be brought to an end. Russia needs to change its policies,"" Jeffrey said.
The United States, France and the United Kingdom called for a United Nations Security Council meeting on Thursday to discuss the situation in Idlib.
President Donald Trump softened his plans to pull out U.S. troops from Syria after backlash from Congress, and has kept around 600 troops, largely in northeastern Syria to continue the fight against Islamic State.
However, in northwestern Syria, the United States has no troops on the ground and thus little leverage on Russia or the Syrian government in asserting its position.
The Idlib violence has accelerated in recent months despite several ceasefire efforts, including as recently as January.
On Wednesday, Syrian government forces entered Saraqeb in Idlib, a war monitor and eyewitnesses said, in a renewed push by President Bashar al-Assad to recapture the last rebel stronghold.
""We're seeing not just the Russians but Iranians and Hezbollah actively involved in supporting the Syrian offensive. We don't know whether the offensive is just to get to the M4-M5 road, or it may continue further,"" Jeffrey said, in reference to the strategic highways connecting Syria's Aleppo to Hama and Latakia on the Mediterranean coast.
Jeffrey said Moscow could change its policies and meet the requirements of the international community without ousting Assad. ""Those requirements are not unreasonable. ... They require a change in that (Assad) government's behavior. That government would not survive a week without the Russian assistance.""
RUSSIA VIOLATING DE-CONFLICTION
Northeastern Syria is a complicated battleground with forces of the United States, Turkey and Russia as well the Syrian government and aligned Iranian militia operating, sometimes in close proximity.
Moscow has been filling the vacuum of U.S. withdrawal from the area, ramping up its military presence in Syria's northeast, and de-confliction agreements between the two sides ensure they avoid any clashes.
But Jeffrey on Wednesday said there have been more incidents of Russia's violating the terms of de-confliction in what he characterized as an attempt to challenge the U.S. presence in there.
""We've seen a limited number of occasions where ... they've tried to come deep into the area where we and the SDF are patrolling well inside the basic lines we have sketched. Those are the ones that are worrying me,"" he said, referring to Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that works with Washington in northeastern Syria.

He said while the numbers of such incidents were not very high, they were on the rise. ""Thus is troubling,"" he said, and called on Moscow to adhere fully to the de-confliction agreements with the United States.

BUCHAN, Australia (Reuters) - It was an inevitability, thought Australian cattle farmer Donald Graham and his wife Bronwyn, that bushfires would one day tear through the bushland that surrounded their home, a remote property overlooking the Snowy River National Park.
It's the reason they installed two concrete bunkers on their property in December 2018, a year before devastating fires would roar up the nearby gullies.
""We thought it was just a matter of time, that definitively there would be a fire,"" said Graham, a 68-year-old with a shock of white hair, ""So we put the two bunkers in."" 
It was a decision that would save their lives.
This summer bushfires have swept across Australia, burning through almost 12 million hectares, destroying more than 2,500 homes and killing 33 people, in some of the worst bushfires in decades. 
When the fires ripped through Buchan, a small farming community in eastern Victoria on Dec. 30, they bellowed in on three fronts. Farmer Jeff McCole described the fires as ""unfightable"", and said that all he and other ""dumbfounded"" residents could do was “just stand there and watch."" 
At their property 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) away, the Grahams saw the fires sweep across the bush from the north and the west, roaring loudly, whipped up by strong winds.
""It was very hot and smoky and the air was filled with embers, and the trees were all alight, not flaming but glowing,"" recalled Graham, ""It looked like Christmas all around us in a sense, Christmas lights in the trees, but of course it wasn't.""
Taking cheese and vegemite sandwiches with them, the couple climbed down into their bunker, where they had already placed heirlooms and water. 
Tall enough for a man to stand and designed to shelter six people, the bunker is covered with a mound of earth, and the only thing visible from above is its large metal door.
Watching from a peephole, the couple saw their home consumed by flames, flattened into a scatter of bricks, china and warped metal.
As the fire roared over, the Graham's estimated they were inside for about 15 to 20 sweltering minutes, before they emerged to spent the next few hours fighting a fire threatening their shed.

Just before dawn, with the air filled with thick sepia-colored smoke, they crawled into their pick-up truck and turned on the air conditioning, exhausted but alive.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison reshuffled his cabinet on Thursday, replacing two senior ministers from junior coalition partner the National Party following their recent resignations.
Morrison said Keith Pitt - a well-known supporter of nuclear power and the coal industry - will become Australia's minister for mining and resources. 
David Littleproud, Australia's minister for drought, will combine that role with the responsibility of overseeing the country's A$60 billion ($40 billion) agricultural sector. 
Matt Canavan resigned earlier this week as minister for mining and resources amid an unsuccessful attempt to replace the leader of the National Party . 
Fellow National Party minister Bridget McKenzie resigned from her post as minister of agriculture on Sunday after an independent audit found money from a A$100 million sports development fund was used to target votes ahead of last year's federal election.
The appointment of Pitt was welcomed by Australia's resource sector.
""Keith Pitt has a reputation for straight-talking and as a regional Queenslander he knows first-hand about the importance of the resources sector to create jobs and investment in regional communities,"" said Ian Macfarlane, chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council in an emailed statement.
""He also has a strong understanding of the policy issues that relate to the resources sector, in particular the need for affordable and reliable energy."" 

As part of the reshuffle, Darren Chester, minister for veteran affairs and another National Party member of parliament, will keep his position but it will be promoted to a Cabinet post, Morrison added.

(Reuters) - Kirk Douglas, the cleft-chinned movie star who fought gladiators, cowboys and boxers on the screen and the Hollywood establishment, died on Wednesday at the age of 103, his son Michael Douglas said.
“It is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and I announce that Kirk Douglas left us today at the age of 103,” Michael Douglas said in a statement to People magazine and on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
“To the world, he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies who lived well into his golden years, a humanitarian whose commitment to justice and the causes he believed in set a standard for all of us to aspire to,” Douglas added.
“Kirk’s life was well lived, and he leaves a legacy in film that will endure for generations to come, and a history as a renowned philanthropist who worked to aid the public and bring peace to the planet,” Michael added, saying he was ""so proud"" to be his father's son.
Douglas made more than 90 movies in a career that stretched across seven decades and films such as ""Spartacus"" and ""The Vikings"" made him one of the biggest box-office stars of the 1950s and '60s.
He also played a major role in breaking the Hollywood blacklist - actors, directors and writers who were shunned professionally because of links to the communist movement in the 1950s. Douglas said he was more proud of that than any film he made.
Tributes poured in from Hollywood. Actor and director Rob Reiner said on Twitter that Douglas ""will always be an icon in the pantheon of Hollywood. He put himself on the line to break the blacklist.""
Mitzi Gaynor, who appeared with Douglas in the 1963 movie ""For Love or Money,"" said the film would ""always hold a special place in my heart."" 
""Thank you for so generously sharing your amazing talent with all of us,"" Gaynor tweeted.
Danny DeVito called him an ""inspirational Scallywag,"" while Ed Asner tweeted ""I will always be in your awe.""
A stroke in 1996 at age 80 left Douglas with slurred speech and damaged facial nerves. But two weeks later he showed his spirit by attending the Academy Awards ceremony to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award. He also continued to take small acting roles through 2008 but said the stroke left him suicidal.
""Humor saved me,"" Douglas told Parade magazine in 2014. ""At first, I thought my life was at an end. But when I put the gun in my mouth, it hit a tooth. Ow! And that struck me funny. A toothache was stopping me from committing suicide?""
In one of his last public appearances, Douglas was frail and barely audible in a wheelchair as he helped daughter-in-law Catherine Zeta-Jones present the Oscar for best screenplay in January 2018. In November of that year he joined his son Michael as the younger Douglas was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Douglas had a distinctive chin, razor-sharp cheekbones and a jutting jaw - looks that he passed along to Michael - and that made him a natural for playing all manner of rugged characters.
He also had a demanding nature that earned him a reputation in his prime as the actor who directed directors. Long-time friend and sometime co-star Burt Lancaster loved to introduce him by saying, ""Kirk would be the first to admit he is a difficult person. (Pause) I would be the second.""
""I make my own way,"" Douglas once told an interviewer. ""Nobody's my boss. Nobody's ever been my boss ... I've been a maverick.""
Douglas said playing Vincent van Gogh in ""Lust for Life"" (1956) was his favorite role but ""Spartacus"" (1960) was his favorite film because, as producer, he took a big step toward breaking the Hollywood blacklist.
The lifetime Oscar was Douglas' only Academy Award even though he was nominated for playing ruthless boxer Midge Kelly in ""Champion"" (1949), a movie executive in ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" (1952) and van Gogh in ""Lust for Life.""
Douglas' first movie was ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers,"" in 1946 after being suggested for the part by acting school classmate Betty Joan Perske, who became famous after changing her name to Lauren Bacall.
Douglas was known for powerful performances as characters who had to endure intense on-screen pain. He was stabbed in ""Ace in the Hole,"" crucified in ""Spartacus,"" lost an eye in ""The Vikings,"" an ear in ""Lust for Life,"" and a finger in ""The Big Sky.""
His other notable movies were ""Lonely Are the Brave,"" ""The Devil's Disciple,"" ""Victory at Entebbe"" and ""Tough Guys,"" which he made with Lancaster in 1986.
Douglas' independent streak led him to set up Bryna Production Co, which he named after his mother, in 1955, snubbing big studio bosses and helping break their monopoly on the industry.
Born Issur Danielovich on Dec. 9, 1916, in Amsterdam, New York, Douglas was the only son of seven children born to illiterate Russian immigrants. 
After graduating from high school, he hitch-hiked to St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, where he became a wrestling champion. He also staged and starred in theatrical productions and changed his name to Izzy Demsy.
After St. Lawrence, he graduated from New York's American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1941 and changed his name to Kirk Douglas. He joined the Navy following two small Broadway roles.
While in the Navy he married British actress Diana Dill and they had two sons, Michael and Joel, before the marriage ended after eight years.
Douglas had a reputation as a Hollywood ladies' man. Among the lovers listed in the 1988 book ""The Ragman's Son,"" one of several books he wrote about his life, were Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich, Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Maxwell, Patricia Neal and Gene Tierney.
While making ""Act of Love,"" Douglas met and Anne Buydens, the film's publicist, and they married in 1954. Their marriage became one of Hollywood's most enduring despite his affairs. They had two sons, Peter and Eric.
Douglas, who survived a 1991 helicopter crash that killed two people, tried to discourage his children from following him into acting. Still, Michael became a superstar and a successful producer, Joel and Peter also were producers and Eric was an actor until his 2004 death from a drug overdose.
""You see how they listened to me,"" Douglas once said.
Douglas, who grew a long white ponytail in his later years, published several books, including a book of poetry, prose and photographs in 2014 and “Kirk and Anne: Letters of Love, Laughter and a Lifetime in Hollywood,"" in 2017 with his wife.
He established the Douglas Foundation for making charitable donations and in 2015 he and Anne announced plans to give away his $80 million fortune to a variety of causes. The beneficiaries included a shelter for homeless women named after Anne, the Los Angeles public school district, St. Lawrence University and hospitals.

To mark his 99th birthday in 2015 he donated $15 million to the Motion Picture and Television Fund to help build a facility for entertainment industry figures with Alzheimer’s disease.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada and China are both ""furious"" over the case of a Huawei executive detained in Canada in 2018 and its aftermath, but there are signs the two sides can hold constructive talks, the Canadian ambassador to Beijing said on Wednesday.
Canadian police picked up Huawei Technologies Co Ltd chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. arrest warrant in December 2018, after which China arrested two Canadian citizens on security charges and blocked imports of canola seed.
""We're angry, we're very angry because of our people that have been taken. China is very angry as well, furious, we're both furious,"" Dominic Barton told a special committee of legislators looking into ties with Beijing.
Barton was appointed Canada's envoy to China in September 2019.
""The first conversation I had there was probably one of the most unpleasant conversations I have ever had ... there wasn't even a basis to have a discussion,"" he said.
The first phase of the legal battle over whether Meng should be extradited to the United States wrapped up last month. China demanded Ottawa release her but the Canadian government says it will not interfere in the judicial process.
Barton noted what he called small improvements in relations, such as China's decision last year to lift a ban on imports of Canadian meat products.
""There's a momentum - they want to have this sorted and we want to have this sorted ... I see lots of green shoots,"" he told legislators.
Barton also noted progress in talks on lifting the canola seed ban but said there had been no results yet, and praised China's efforts to combat a major coronavirus outbreak.
Barton said bilateral ties could not properly be restored until the release of the two detained Canadians, however. China's foreign ministry said in December 2019 that their case had been turned over to prosecutors.
""I am unbelievably inspired by their resilience,"" he said."

Syrian state run Ikhbariyah TV said the attack was launched from over the Golan Heights as well as through Lebanese airspace. State news agency SANA said air defences downed most of the missiles before they reached their targets.
There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.
British-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said several missiles were fired on Syrian government forces and Iranian militias near Damascus, including in al-Kiswa town and Mezze military airport.
Israel has repeatedly bombed Iranian-backed militia targets in Syria, saying its goal was to end Tehran’s military presence which Western intelligence sources say has expanded in recent years in the war-torn country.
Last month, the Syrian army said Israeli jets attacked the main T4 air base in Homs province, and that its air defences downed several missiles in strikes that caused only material damage. In December, it said the air defence system intercepted missiles fired from the direction of Israel aimed at targets on the outskirts Damascus.

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 07:07PM ET</span>","Record number of anti-Semitic incidents logged in Britain, again","By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - The number of anti-Semitic incidents logged in Britain last year hit record levels yet again amid accusations the opposition Labour Party had failed to tackle the issue within its ranks, a Jewish advisory body said on Thursday.
The Community Security Trust (CST), which advises Britain's estimated 280,000 Jews on security matters, said there had been 1,805 incidents in 2019, a rise of 7% and the fourth consecutive year the figure had reached a new high.
CST chief executive David Delew said the record came as no surprise and the organization believed the real number was likely to be far higher.
""It is clear that both social media and mainstream politics are places where anti-Semitism and racism need to be driven out, if things are to improve in the future,"" he said.
World leaders warned last month of a growing tide of anti-Jewish sentiment, driven both by far-right white supremacists and those from the far-left, as they commemorated victims of the Holocaust in World War Two.
In Britain, the CST said there was an increase in incidents in months when Labour's problems with anti-Semitism were in the news.
Ever since veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn, an ardent supporter of Palestinian rights, became leader in 2015, the party has faced accusations that it has failed to stem anti-Semitism among some members.
Corbyn, who is stepping down as leader in April, has said anti-Semitism is ""vile and wrong"" but the party is now under investigation by Britain's Equality and Human Rights Commission.
Last February, a number of Labour lawmakers left the party citing the issue as a reason, while ahead of December's national election, Britain's chief rabbi said Corbyn was unfit to be prime minister.
Of the total number of incidents, 224 were connected to Labour, said the CST, which has collated such data since 1984.
""It is hard to precisely disaggregate the impact of the continuing Labour anti-Semitism controversy upon CST’s statistics, but it clearly has an important bearing,"" the report said.
The charity said the main reason for the overall increase in incidents was a sharp rise in online anti-Semitism.
But there were also 157 assaults - a 27% increase on 2018 - with almost 50% of these occurring in just three areas of the country - Barnet and Hackney in London and Salford in northern England which are home to some of the largest Jewish communities.
A rise of intolerance after Britons voted in the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union and the Brexit discourse since, which brought nationalism and immigration to the fore, had also led an atmosphere where people might have felt able to express their ""hatred of otherness"", the report said."

Speaking to reporters in the eastern province of Van, Koca said that three people had died in hospital after the accident, adding that 179 out of the 183 passengers and crew on the plane were wounded.
Istanbul Governor Ali Yerlikaya said earlier that the plane was carrying 177 passengers and six crew from the western province of Izmir. He said the wounded were being treated at 18 hospitals in the area.
""The plane could not hold on the runway due to poor weather conditions and skidded for around 50-60 meters,"" Yerlikaya told reporters at the airport.
The plane, a Boeing (N:BA) 737-86J, split into three pieces after what Yerlikaya said was a drop of around 30 to 40 meters at the end of the wet runway. Footage showed the plane landing and continuing at a high speed off the runway.
Transport Minister Cahit Turhan said flights waiting to land in Sabiha Gokcen had been diverted to Istanbul Airport.
Pegasus (IS:PGSUS) said in a statement that the plane had gone off the runway and that passengers were being evacuated. A spokeswoman for the company did not provide further details.
Broadcaster NTV said that the plane had attempted to land in heavy tailwinds despite the previous two flights holding off due to the wind.
Television footage showed the plane's fuselage, as well as a section of it near the tail, had broken off. Passengers were being led out as the plane lay on a patch of grass next to the runway. Dozens of emergency response personnel took passengers out of the plane and carried them away on stretchers.
Earlier footage showed part of the exterior of the plane had caught on fire, which state media said was extinguished by firefighters.

Turkish Airlines (IS:THYAO) said it had canceled all its flight in and out of Sabiha Gokcen for the day.

In January, Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk submitted a letter of resignation after some media published an audio in which he appeared to criticize the president while talking to ministers and central bank officials.
Honcharuk has previously said the recording had been doctored and was made up of different fragments of what had been said at government meetings.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has not accepted the resignation and urged law enforcement bodies to determine who was involved in making the recording.
""The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) conducted a pre-trial investigation into the illegal use of special technical means of obtaining information at the premises of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine,"" the SBU said in a statement.
It added that its investigators had found that ""individuals who periodically visited the office of ""1+1"" may be involved in the unlawful use of special technical means of obtaining information"".
The security service said it suspected undisclosed individuals had edited and distributed the audio recordings.
The TV channel, which is owned by one of Ukraine's most powerful tycoons, Ihor Kolomoisky, with whom Zelenskiy had close business ties, accused the SBU of trying to put pressure on journalists who produce investigative programs.
The SBU denied that, saying ""We are talking about an impartial and comprehensive investigation into a criminal case of an illegal wiretap of the head of government"".
Zelenskiy, a television sitcom star, was elected in a landslide election last April."

The meeting in Uganda between Sudan's Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu stirred controversy in Sudan after Israeli officials said it would lead to normalizing relations between the two former foes.
Tensions have risen between the military and civilian groups sharing power after last year's overthrow of former president Omar al-Bashir. The cabinet has held two emergency meetings over the Uganda trip, about which it says it was not informed.
Sudan's military responded with a rare political statement on Wednesday, describing Burhan's trip to meet Netanyahu as being in ""the highest interests of national security and of Sudan.""
Sudanese military spokesman Amer Mohamed al-Hassan told Al Jazeera there had been an agreement ""in principle"" for use of Sudan's airspace by commercial aircraft traveling from South America to Israel, though he said technical aspects of the overflights were still being studied and Sudan had not agreed to overflights by Israeli carrier El Al.
""Sudan has not announced full normalization (with Israel), but it is exchanging interests,"" he said.
Netanyahu had previously said opening Sudanese airspace to Israeli civilian planes would cut hours off flights to South America, Israel's fourth-most important travel destination.
That African air corridor would also include Egypt and Chad, with which Israel renewed long-severed relations in 2018.
""With Sudan we are now establishing cooperative relations,"" Netanyahu said in a campaign speech on Wednesday. ""We will overfly Sudan.""
This week's meeting in Uganda coincided with an announcement that Burhan had been invited to visit Washington later this year. It also came a week after Netanyahu, who faces an election on March 2, traveled to Washington for the unveiling of U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan.
Sudan is striving to rebuild links with the outside world after decades of isolation under Islamist Bashir, and to be removed from a U.S. list of countries considered state sponsors of terrorism.
Israeli commentators have suggested the rapprochement with Khartoum might enable the repatriation of thousands of Sudanese who make up around a fifth of illegal migrants and asylum-seekers in Israel. A senior Israeli official on Tuesday played this prospect down.
""No one consulted with me before the trip (by Netanyahu to Uganda) and no one reported to me after the trip. We are not involved in any process that I am familiar with,"" Shlomo Mor Yosef, head of the Interior Ministry's immigration authority, told Israel's Army Radio."

Thomas Kemmerich, a little-known liberal Free Democrat (FDP), became the first state premier elected with the support of the AfD, with whom Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) sided to the disgust of her national coalition partners.
The CDU and all the other established parties have previously ostracized the AfD over what they say are racist views held by some of its members.
Merkel's Social Democrat (SPD) national coalition allies accused her CDU of backtracking on a pledge never to cooperate with a far-right party. The CDU rejected the accusation, saying it was not responsible for how AfD lawmakers voted. Wednesday's ballot was secret.
""The events in Thuringia break a taboo in the history of political democracy in the Federal Republic,"" SPD Finance Minister Olaf Scholz tweeted. ""Very serious questions arise for us with the CDU's federal leadership.""
CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said her party's national leadership opposed both cooperating with the AfD and joining a Kemmerich-led state cabinet. ""The best thing would be for voters in Thuringia to have new elections,"" she added.
The SPD is unlikely to ditch Merkel's national coalition over the vote in Thuringia but the center-left party said its supporters would hold a protest outside the CDU headquarters in Berlin.
""The vote on the new premier minister in the state of Thuringia marks a new milestone in German politics and bears the potential of more shockwaves in national politics,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.
Kemmerich won 45-44 against Bodo Ramelow, the outgoing premier of The Left party. Ramelow's leftist coalition failed to secure a majority in an October regional election.
Kemmerich, whose FDP is the smallest party in the regional assembly, said he would launch talks with the CDU, SPD and Greens on forming a government.
SPD national leader Norbert Walter-Borjans spoke of an ""unforgivable dam burst, triggered by the CDU and FDP""."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A Mexican video blogger, wearing a black eye patch and with metal surgical pins lodged in his face after a murder attempt, confronted President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Wednesday about the dangers journalists face and demanded justice.
Lopez Obrador promised to increase protections for journalists when he took office in December 2018. Since then, 11 have been killed. The country is considered the world's second- most-dangerous for media workers, after Syria. 
""President, they are killing us, don't forget it please, they are killing us,"" Paul Velazquez, an independent journalist who criticizes corruption on YouTube and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), said at Lopez Obrador's regular press conference.
On Dec. 19, Velazquez was shot in the face as he walked toward his recording studio in the city of Los Mochis in the crime-ridden western state of Sinaloa. The attack took place after a close collaborator to the mayor of Los Mochis threatened his life, Velazquez told Reuters.
Velazquez sent Reuters a video, taken from a security camera, that shows a man stepping out from behind a car and shooting him. 
Another video, apparently filmed by a passer-by on a cell phone, shows the journalist staggering in a grocery store and being assisted as blood spreads across the floor.
Velazquez accused Los Mochis Mayor Manuel Guillermo Chapman Moreno, who goes by the name of Billy Chapman, of being behind the assassination attempt. A spokesman at Chapman's office declined to comment.
""President, I want to remind you that investigative journalists are not trophies for corrupt rulers to hunt down,"" said Velazquez.
In April 2019, Velazquez attended Lopez Obrador's press conference and publicly accused Chapman of corruption and asked for the president's help in removing him from office. Since the attack, Velazquez has been receiving government protection. 
The Committee for Protection of Journalists (CPJ) has singled out Mexico as dangerous for journalists, who are often targeted when their work upsets criminal gangs or corrupt officials. 
A total of 131 have been killed in Mexico since 2000, according to free-speech advocacy group Article 19, which counts 11 since Lopez Obrador took office. CPJ says at least five were killed in reprisal for their work, and is investigating another six cases.

Article 19 spokesman Julio Cesar Colin said the attack on Velasquez was clearly in the context of his work and should be investigated by Mexico's special prosecutor for crimes against freedom of expression.

""After the fifth step, there hasn't been any follow-up,"" said Raphael Grossi on his first official visit to Washington since becoming director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency in December. ""Of course, they continue to enrich.""
Tehran in July began stockpiling more low-enriched uranium than allowed by the nuclear deal in the first of five breaches that it has declared in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's 2018 decision to pull the United States out of the accord and re-impose harsh sanctions that have strangled Iran's petroleum exports, battering its economy.
Iran says it would reverse the violations, which have included enriching uranium to a higher level than set in the agreement and operating prohibited advanced centrifuges, the machines that purify uranium, if the sanctions were removed.
The breaches were aimed at pressuring European powers to help Iran weather the impact of the U.S. sanctions and perhaps also at pressuring the United States to ease sanctions and open talks with Iran.
After Iran last month announced it no longer would observe any of the deal's restraints, Britain, France and Germany triggered the deal’s dispute mechanism, opening the door to a possible re-imposition of international sanctions. Russia and China also are parties to the deal.
Grossi said he discussed Iran's nuclear program on Tuesday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo but declined to elaborate. During a think tank appearance on Wednesday, Grossi said the IAEA continues to monitor the Iranian nuclear program.

The deal was designed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The IAEA and the U.S. intelligence community separately concluded that Tehran shuttered a nuclear weapons development effort in 2003. Iran denies it ever pursued a nuclear weapon.

1452,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 03:02PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Iran-linked hackers pose as journalists in email scam,"By Raphael Satter and Christopher Bing
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Iranian-born German academic Erfan Kasraie received an email from The Wall Street Journal requesting an interview, he sensed something was amiss.
The Nov. 12 note purportedly came from Farnaz Fassihi, a veteran Iranian-American journalist who covers the Middle East. Yet it read more like a fan letter, asking Kasraie to share his ""important achievements"" to ""motivate the youth of our beloved country.""
""This interview is a great honor for me,"" the note gushed.
Another red flag: the follow-up email that instructed Kasraie to enter his Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) password to see the interview questions.
The phony request was in reality an attempt to break into Kasraie's email account. The incident is part of a wider effort to impersonate journalists in hacking attempts that three cybersecurity firms said they have tied to the Iranian government, which rejected the claim. The incidents come to light at a time when the U.S. government has warned of Iranian cyber threats in the wake of the U.S. air strike that killed Iran’s second most powerful official, Major-General Qassem Soleimani. 
In a report https://blog.certfa.com/posts/fake-interview-the-new-activity-of-charming-kitten published Wednesday, London-based cybersecurity company Certfa tied the impersonation of Fassihi to a hacking group nicknamed Charming Kitten, which has long been associated with Iran. Israeli firm ClearSky Cyber Security provided Reuters with documentation of similar impersonations of two media figures at CNN and Deutsche Welle, a German public broadcaster. ClearSky also linked the hacking attempts to Charming Kitten, describing the individuals targeted as Israeli academics or researchers who study Iran. ClearSky declined to give the specific number of people targeted or to name them, citing client confidentiality.
Iran denies operating or supporting any hacking operation. Alireza Miryousefi, the spokesman for the Islamic Republic's mission to the United Nations, said that firms claiming otherwise ""are merely participants in the disinformation campaign against Iran.""
Reuters uncovered similar hacking attempts on two other targets, which the two cybersecurity firms, along with a third firm, Atlanta-based Secureworks, said also appeared to be the work of Charming Kitten. Azadeh Shafiee, an anchor for London-based satellite broadcaster Iran International, was impersonated by hackers in attempts to break into the accounts of a relative of hers in London and Prague-based Iranian filmmaker Hassan Sarbakhshian.
Sarbakhshian - who fled the Islamic Republic amid a crackdown that saw the arrest of several fellow photojournalists in 2009 - was also targeted with an email that claimed to be from Fassihi. The message asked him to sign a contract to sell some of his pictures to The Wall Street Journal. Sarbakhshian said in an interview that he was suspicious of the message and didn't respond.
Neither did the ruse fool Kasraie, an academic who frequently appears on television criticizing Iran's government.
“I understood 100 percent that it was a trap,” he said in an interview.
That's not surprising given the hackers' sloppy tactics. For instance, they missed the fact that Fassihi had left the Journal last year for a new job at The New York Times.
The Journal declined to comment. Fassihi referred questions to The Times, which in a statement called the impersonation ""a vivid example of the challenges journalists are facing around the globe.""
U.S. officials and cybersecurity experts see Iran as a digital threat. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued alerts about the threat of Iranian cyberattacks following the controversial U.S. attack that killed Soleimani. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which tracks attempts to undermine election security, in October accused Charming Kitten of targeting a U.S. presidential campaign; sources told Reuters https://reut.rs/38a9rEM at the time that the campaign was Donald Trump's.
Homeland Security and FBI spokespeople declined to comment on the recent impersonations identified by Reuters. Certfa, ClearSky, and Secureworks said they could be tied to Charming Kitten through a study of the tactics, targets, and digital infrastructure involved - including servers, link shortening services, and domain registration patterns. 
“This activity does align with prior Iranian cyber operations,” said Allison Wikoff, a Secureworks researcher who has tracked Charming Kitten for years.
In early 2019, the United States indicted Behzad Mesri - who ClearSky has linked to Charming Kitten through emails and social media activity - on charges of recruiting a former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer to spy on behalf of Iran. Mesri remains at large and could not be reached for comment.
Other impersonated journalists included CNN national security analyst Samantha Vinograd, whose identity was stolen in August and used in attempts to break into email accounts in Israel, ClearSky said. Another was Michael Hartlep, a Berlin-based videojournalist who has done freelance assignments for Deutsche Welle and Reuters. ClearSky found his name on an email inviting recipients to a bogus Deutsche Welle webinar on Iran's role in the Middle East. The firm did not find evidence that the Reuters name was used in hacking attempts. 
In another case, the hackers appear to have invented a journalist - ""Keyarash Navidpour"" - to send out a phony invitation on Jan. 4 to an online seminar that it claimed Deutsche Welle would hold about the killing of Soleimani the day before. No such journalist works for Deutsche Welle, said the news organization’s spokesman Christoph Jumpelt.
Vinograd referred questions to CNN, which did not return messages seeking comment. Hartlep told Reuters he worried such stunts might give sources second thoughts about answering a reporter's queries.
""If this becomes the usual way of tricking people,"" he said, ""definitely it makes our work very hard.""

The medical sources said at least 20 more were wounded in the violence but did not provide further details.
The security sources said that supporters of Sadr, known as blue hats for the blue caps they often wear, had tried to clear the area of anti-government protesters, who in turn tried to stop them.
Fights broke out between both groups, the blue hats threw petrol bombs at protester tents and live gunfire rang out shortly afterwards, wounding and killing eight people, they said.
Iraq's designated Prime Minister Mohammed Allawi, who was tasked last week with forming a new government, condemned the violence and called on Twitter on the outgoing cabinet which is acting in a caretaker capacity to ""protect protesters"".
Sadr, who supported Allawi's candidacy in an agreement with Iran-backed parties that dominate Iraq's government and state institutions, has at different times both supported and abandoned Iraqi protesters who demand a removal of the entire ruling elite.
The cleric says he opposes all foreign interference in Iraq, but has aligned himself more closely with parties backed by Tehran in recent months.
He urged followers last week to help authorities bring ""day to day life"" back to Iraq's streets by clearing roads blocked by sit-ins and ensuring businesses and schools can reopen after months of protests in which nearly 500 people have been killed in clashes between protesters and security forces.
Sadr has also urged the blue hats to allow protests to continue."

Guaido, president of the opposition-held National Assembly, is recognized as Venezuela's rightful president by dozens of countries including the United States. For nearly three weeks, he has been on an international tour aimed at drumming up support. 
Guaido was a guest at Tuesday's State of the Union address, when Trump, a Republican, praised him as a ""very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams and aspirations of all Venezuelans."" Guaido received a standing ovation from U.S. Congress members of both the Democratic and Republican parties.

Maduro has overseen an economic collapse in the once-prosperous OPEC nation, and has been accused of corruption and human rights violations. He calls Guaido a U.S. puppet seeking to oust him in a coup.

Government forces were combing the town after rebel fighters fled following intense aerial and ground bombardment of Saraqeb, 15 km (9 miles) east of Idlib city, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on its website.
Eye witnesses told Reuters that rebel fighters had left and that government forces were in control of the town, which lies at the junction of two main roads that Damascus seeks to fully control. 
Syrian state TV said on Wednesday that the roads were now within firing range of government forces.
Assad's campaign to regain Idlib province, the last rebel bastion in a nearly nine-year-long civil war, has sparked a new exodus of thousands of civilians towards the border with Turkey, which backs some insurgent groups fighting Assad.
The renewed fighting is taking place despite a Jan. 12 ceasefire deal between Turkey and Russia, which back opposing sides of the conflict. Shelling by Syrian government forces killed eight Turkish military personnel on Monday, prompting Turkish forces to strike back. 
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan threatened on Wednesday to drive back Syrian troops in Idlib unless they withdraw by the end of the month to stem an assault which he said had displaced nearly 1 million people.

The 411 kilograms of cocaine destined for the commercial capital Abidjan came from a Spanish-flagged ship that had been spotted by the navy idling 250 km (155 miles) off the coast since Jan. 30, the navy said in a statement on Wednesday.
The ship offloaded the drugs onto a smaller boat which was picked up by a special unit of the Ivorian navy on Monday at about 1830 GMT, the navy said. Five people were also taken into custody.
It was not yet clear where the cocaine originated from or who was responsible for trafficking it.
Camera footage provided by the Ivorian navy on Wednesday showed hundreds of the seized packages laid out on tables.
Major drug hauls in Ivory Coast are rare, but over the last 18 months several large cocaine seizures have been made along the West African Atlantic Coast, a frequent stopping point for South American cocaine heading to Europe. About 40 tonnes pass through the region annually, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
About 9.5 tonnes were seized in the island archipelago of Cape Verde last year in one of the biggest hauls ever. Last September, police in Guinea-Bissau seized more than 1.8 tonnes hidden in flour bags, the biggest in the country's history."

The judgment comes as investigators and states increase pressure on refineries to make sure illegally mined or traded gold does not enter the market.
It also increases the focus on Alain Goetz, one of the brothers sentenced, who established a refinery in Uganda that officials there say they are investigating for accepting gold from Venezuela that may have been smuggled. The refinery denies wrongdoing.
The court ruling said Alain and Sylvain Goetz set up a fraudulent system in 2010 and 2011 for customers to sell gold anonymously to the Tony Goetz refinery in Antwerp for cash, creating the basis for black-market trade.
    The refinery registered gold traders as private customers and split large purchases to circumvent limits on cash transactions, and accepted metal taken by armed robbers in the Antwerp gold quarter, it said.
    Tony Goetz paid more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in cash for gold during 2010 and 2011 and created around 9.2 million euros in illegal capital gains, the ruling, issued on Jan. 30, said.
    The court fined the refinery 99,000 euros.
Both the jail terms and the fine were suspended, meaning they will not take effect unless the refinery or brothers re-offend.
Sylvain Goetz runs the refinery and is the eldest son of its founder.
    ""Tony Goetz contests these facts and upholds that the company did not violate any law,"" the refinery said in a statement, adding that it was considering whether to appeal.
    Tony Goetz ""does not cooperate in any way in the illegal trade of gold or other precious metals and conducts its activities in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations,"" it said, adding that since 2012 it has not accepted any cash payments.
It also said Alain Goetz was no longer connected with the company and it does not accept gold from Venezuela or Uganda.
    Alain Goetz said he had resigned as a director and sold his shares around 2014. He also said he had stepped down from management and sold his shares in the Ugandan refinery.
    Alain Goetz said the ruling was ""erroneous"" and paying for gold in cash was common and legal during 2010 and 2011.
    ""Neither Alain Goetz nor Tony Goetz NV breached any anti-money laundering regulations or other legislation in force at that time,"" he said in a statement to Reuters.
    Around 25 customers of Tony Goetz were also found guilty by the court for participation in the system, with some given suspended jail sentences of up to nine months."

PARIS (Reuters) - French ice sports federation president Didier Gailhaguet refused to resign on Wednesday amid claims of rape and sexual assault of minors in figure skating, admitting to having made 'mistakes' but saying he was never 'at fault'.
French prosecutors on Tuesday launched a preliminary investigation into former figure skating coach Gilles Beyer for the alleged rape of a minor and sexual aggression.
Former figure skater Sarah Abitbol, a bronze medallist with partner Stephane Bernadis at the 2000 world championships, recently published a book in which she said Beyer had raped her multiple times from 1990 to 1992.
Beyer last week said that he had had ""intimate"" and ""inappropriate"" relations with Abibtol, who is now 44, in comments to Agence France Presse. Beyer could not immediately be reached for comment.
Three other skaters also claimed they were raped by former coaches.
Gailhaguet has been president of the FFSG since 1998 with a hiatus between 2004-07 after he was suspended by the International Skating Union for his role in a judging scandal at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.
Beyer, however, was the team manager of a French juniors team at the 2011 world championships, despite a Sports ministry-led inquiry from 2000 showing that the former coach had inappropriate behaviour with an underage skater.
The inquiry showed that in 1999, Beyer went to an underage skater's bedroom during a training camp and 'put his hand behind the young girl's neck, pulled her toward him and asked 'do you want me to kiss you or do you want me to go'.""
""He asked her how old she was, adding, after she had told him she was 17, '17 or 18, it doesn't change anything',"" stated the report, which Reuters has seen.
""Everybody makes mistakes. I made mistakes but I was never at fault,"" Gailhaguet, who claimed he initiated the 2000 inquiry, told a news conference.
""Yes, the executive committee named him team manager of the juniors team in 2011. It's easy to judge now that we know the facts.
""Ninety percent of all the facts, I've just learned them,"" said Gailhaguet, who admitted he had 'not fully read' Abitbol's book.
Sports minister Roxana Maracineanu asked Gailhaguet to resign, saying he could not ""absolve himself of his moral and personal responsibility"".
The Sports ministry is launching an investigation into 200 figure skating clubs in France.
""I will not resign until I see the results of the investigation,"" Gailhaguet said.
""The minister is asking me to resign over facts that occurred 30 years ago when I was not the president of the FFSG.
""To stigmatise a federation president, who is hard-working and honest, is disgusting."""
1463,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 12:31PM ET</span>","For Democrats, Iowa leaves a muddled path forward","By James Oliphant
WASHINGTON - The first-in-the-nation Democratic nominating contest in Iowa will go down in infamy after technological snafus resulted in results not being reported for nearly a day, costing the candidates who performed well their moment in the media spotlight and allowing others to question the legitimacy of the outcome.
As a result, it is debatable how much momentum the projected winner, whether it is Pete Buttigieg or Bernie Sanders, or any other contender, has going into the next contest, Feb. 11 in New Hampshire. The candidates have already moved on to campaigning in that state.
Now that the returns from 71% of precincts are known, here is how the Iowa caucuses affected the top candidates:
BERNIE SANDERS
The U.S. senator from Vermont was widely viewed as the leading candidate going into the caucuses — and the early reporting from precincts did nothing to contradict that. But Sanders was denied a crowning moment on Monday night, the kind of thing that propels political narratives. Then when results were finally released, they showed Buttigieg ahead in state delegate equivalents with Sanders winning the popular vote.
On top of that, Sanders' supporters also have to be concerned that turnout statistics suggested that there was no new surge of caucus-goers motivated by their desire to unseat President Donald Trump. Instead, it appeared that turnout was similar to 2016, and that Sanders and other candidates were unable to expand the state electorate.
Still, Sanders goes into New Hampshire as the favorite and with the possibility of emerging as the undisputed front-runner.
JOE BIDEN
For someone who bills himself as the most electable candidate in the Democratic presidential field, the fourth-place finish is close to catastrophic, as it will force Biden to face a fresh round of doubts about his viability.
The campaign must hope that the dark cloud over the caucuses may have obscured somewhat the impact of his dismal showing, and it is already focusing on contests later in the month in Nevada and South Carolina, where minority-rich electorates may boost his prospects.
PETE BUTTIGIEG
Buttigieg, the moderate 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, surprised many with his strong showing in Iowa, partly based on his broad appeal across the political spectrum of the party and to different age groups.
In the months leading up to the caucuses, Buttigieg had made a special effort to campaign hard in Iowa where he had a strong campaign organization.
Now the challenge for Buttigieg is to use his Iowa success to increase his appeal to minority voters. Biden's poor Iowa showing could help in that regard.
ELIZABETH WARREN
The U.S. senator from Massachusetts got what she needed, a top-three finish that re-solidifies her standing as a major candidate. But she trailed both Buttigieg and Sanders significantly, perhaps foreshadowing a rocky path ahead in New Hampshire and elsewhere.
Warren's biggest problem continues to be Sanders. She trails him everywhere he is strong. And she may have also lost some upscale voters to Buttigieg in the Iowa suburbs.
Still, her Iowa finish means Warren can now credibly bring her electability argument to New Hampshire.
MIKE BLOOMBERG
Iowa’s woes made Bloomberg’s decision to skip the caucus altogether prescient. The billionaire former New York mayor is pouring unprecedented resources into Super Tuesday states, which award nearly a third of the delegates that will help select a Democratic nominee, and the more muddled the results of the early contests, the more it helps his candidacy.
Moving to exploit the chaos, Bloomberg on Tuesday said he will immediately double his already massive spending on television ads while expanding his staff to more than 2,100.
Biden’s struggles, too, may hand Bloomberg an opportunity to make a stronger claim that he, not Biden, is the moderate who is best alternative to stop Sanders from attaining the nomination.
DONALD TRUMP
The failures of the Iowa Democratic Party gave Trump and his fellow Republicans an easy target, allowing them to paint Democrats at large as incompetent bureaucrats.
In a week in which the president will very likely be acquitted in his impeachment trial and was able to tout his accomplishments in the State of the Union address, the Democrats’ foibles seemed to help place Trump on more solid footing for re-election."
1464,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 12:12PM ET</span>",UK to pass law to stop early release of terrorists by February 27: government source,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain plans to pass emergency legislation by Feb. 27 to prevent convicted terrorists automatically being released from prison half-way through their sentence, a government source said on Wednesday.
Justice minister Robert Buckland announced plans for the law earlier this week after an Islamist attacker stabbed two people in London on Sunday. Sudesh Amman had been released from prison half-way through his term on Jan. 23, despite still being considered a risk by authorities.
He was shot dead by police officers who had placed him under covert surveillance. 
The new emergency law will be introduced to parliament on Tuesday next week.
""If the legislation is passed by Feb. 27 we can prevent the automatic release of any further terrorist suspects who might pose a threat to the public,"" the source said.
""This is emergency legislation which we believe is vital for protecting the public ... We cannot continue to be in a position where the state has no power to block the release of terrorists who continue to pose a threat.""
Neil Basu, the country's top counter-terrorism police officer, welcomed the move to keep the most dangerous offenders locked up for longer but said it was only part of the solution. More had to be done to prevent people becoming radicalized in the first place, he said.
""With 3000 or so subjects of interest currently on our radar and many convicted terrorists soon due to be released from prison, we simply cannot watch all of them, all the time."" 
""Early intervention ... is absolutely key. We need families, friends, colleagues and local communities to recognize that early intervention is not ruining someone’s life but saving it, and potentially that of others, too,"" he said in a statement. 
The government has said the legislation will apply to those already in prison, prompting predictions from some opponents that it could be challenged in the courts for breaching human rights law.
""What we are proposing in this emergency legislation is not to retrospectively alter offenders' sentences as they were imposed by the court,"" the government source said. 
""This is in relation to release arrangements which are part of the administration of a sentence and it would be our position that you can change those without being considered to breach an offender's human rights."" 
London police chief Cressida Dick said if there were to be changes to sentencing, when offenders were released they needed to be freed on ""strong license conditions"".

Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Dick said there was no evidence at this stage that it was ""directed or enabled by anyone else"".

Mohammed al-Hadad was the first Palestinian killed in unrest since Trump unveiled his plan last week to accolades from Israel but condemnation from many in the Arab and Muslim world. 
Witnesses and medical officials said al-Hadad was shot as he took part in a protest in Hebron, a Palestinian city with Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli troops were pelted with rocks.
The Israeli military spokesman's office said in a statement that soldiers ""identified a Palestinian who hurled a Molotov cocktail at them (and) responded with fire in order to remove the threat"".
The Palestinians, who have long shunned the Trump administration, accusing it bias toward Israel, say the peace plan falls far short of their demands for territorial and other rights. Washington deems many of those demands unrealistic.

MASERU (Reuters) - The wife of Lesotho's Prime Minister Thomas Thabane appeared in court on Wednesday charged with murdering his previous wife two days before he took office in 2017.
The handwritten charge sheet said Maesaiah ""did unlawfully and with intent to kill fire a gunshot at one Thabane Lipolelo and inflicted on her gunshot wounds"" on that day. There were no further details and police declined to elaborate.
A Reuters reporter saw Maesaiah in court before she was taken into detention for the alleged murder of Thabane's then-estranged wife Lipolelo on June 14, 2017. Thabane did not attend the hearing.
Maesaiah arrived in a car sandwiched between two heavily armed police vans. Wearing a pink floral dress, she stared impassively at the magistrate as the charges were read out.
Police last month issued an arrest warrant for Maesaiah, after she failed to turn up for questioning in connection with the murder and subsequently went missing.
Lipolelo, then 58, and Thabane, now 80, were going through an acrimonious divorce when an unknown assailant shot her dead near her home in Lesotho's capital Maseru, two days before her husband's inauguration as prime minister. Mabane and Maesaiah married two months later.
At the time the murder was believed to be a political assassination.
Magistrate Nthabiseng Moopisa said the trial would start on Feb. 18. Maesaiah was granted bail.
The love triangle murder case involving a new, younger wife - Maesaiah is 42 - allegedly killing a first wife has captivated citizens and triggered street protests in Lesotho, a mountain state encircled by South Africa.
""We have got ample evidence that actually implicates her to the charge, and also other eight suspects,"" Lesotho deputy police commissioner Mokete Paseka told the South Africa Broadcasting Corporation. ""We are of the view that justice has to be done.""
Outside the court, her sympathizers and opponents traded insults.
""I think for the first time we experience the true meaning of 'all equal before the law',"" said Matanki Lebeta, a 49-year-old teacher. ""I wish they could deny her bail and throw away the key. She has done enough damage to this country."""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is alarmed by the U.S. Navy's decision to deploy low-yield nuclear missiles on submarines since they heighten the risk of a limited nuclear war, a Russian official said on Wednesday.
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the deployment of the W76-2 warhead in the name of strengthening deterrence had caused Russia great concern over U.S. nuclear strategy, Russian news agencies reported.
The U.S. Defense Department said on Tuesday the Navy had fielded a low-yield, submarine-launched ballistic missile warhead, something the Pentagon says is needed to deter adversaries like Russia.
Ryabkov said Russian rearmament and ""promising models of military equipment"" meant the U.S. warheads were not a direct threat to Russian security but were concerning nevertheless.
""The appearance on strategic carriers of low-power warheads means arguments previously voiced by the American side about the possible use of such a device are now being realized in metal form, as products.
""This reflects the fact that the United States is actually lowering the nuclear threshold and that they are conceding the possibility of them waging a limited nuclear war and winning this war. This is extremely alarming.""
Russia's misgivings over U.S. nuclear policy have grown since Washington pulled out of a landmark strategic arms accord, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), in August, citing violations by Russia that Moscow denies.
It means the New START accord, signed in 2010, is the last major nuclear arms control treaty between the world's two biggest nuclear powers. It limits the number of long-range nuclear warheads they can deploy.
""MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE""
Low-yield nuclear weapons, while still devastating, have a strength of less than 20 kilotons. The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, in August 1945, had about the same explosive power.
The argument for these weapons is that larger nuclear bombs are so catastrophic that they would never be used, meaning they are not an effective deterrent. With less destructive power, the low-yield option would potentially be more likely to be used, serving as an effective deterrent, U.S. military officials have said.
On Wednesday, President Vladimir Putin held a ceremony at the Kremlin to welcome 23 new foreign ambassadors to Moscow, including Washington's new envoy, John Sullivan.
Putin said peace and security on the planet largely depended on the stability and predictability of relations between Russia and the United States based on equality, mutual respect of sovereignty and non-interference in each other's affairs.
""We are ready for meaningful dialogue with the American side, including in the sphere of arms control and strategic stability,"" Putin said."

AZAZ, Syria (Reuters) - Cold weather, disease and a lack of shelter and medicine threaten hundreds of thousands of civilians as they flee fighting in Idlib province, in one of the biggest upheavals of Syria's nine-year civil war, aid groups and doctors said.
The migrants, their numbers swelling by the day, are trapped between advancing Syrian government forces, keen to crush the last significant opposition stronghold, and Turkey's closed border.
Some are having to flee by foot, while many others are having to sleep in their cars, as Syrian and Russian warplanes bombard the highways leading north toward Turkey.
A U.N. official appealed for emergency financial assistance to help an estimated 800,000 people in northwest Syria to survive the coming months.
""People are facing a tragedy. For the last two weeks it's been very, very cold. There is rain and mud, and influenza is spreading,"" said Wassim Zakaria, a doctor who works in a clinic in Idlib city that closed on Monday due to heavy bombardment.
The numbers on the move have increased in recent days as the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad advanced to within 8 km (5 miles) of Idlib city, said Selim Tosun, the Turkish Humanitarian Relief Foundation's (IHH) media adviser in Syria.
""If the cold weather continues...there is a risk of epidemics as a large migrant flow is coming,"" he said.
Since November, 692,000 people have abandoned towns south of Idlib city, Tosun said. The number ""is rising every hour"" and could reach 1 million, he added.
Zakaria said people had also started to flee from Idlib city but their options for shelter were limited, with people forced to sleep in cars or tents, many near the walled-off border which prevents Syrians taking refuge in Turkey.
""It's like people are imprisoned here. Last week women and children demonstrated at the border, asking to be allowed across,"" he said.
Turkey's IHH is distributing urgent aid and blankets to those traveling on the highway from Idlib city and has set up 2,000 tents, with plans to put up another 1,500, Tosun said.
Some 700 breeze-block dwellings have also been built out of a total 10,000 which Turkey is planning to erect in the region south of its border, he said.
He added that many people were now seeking shelter beyond Idlib province, already home to waves of civilians displaced earlier in Syria's civil war, and were heading toward Afrin and Azaz, areas just to the northeast under the control of Turkish-led Syrian rebel forces.
AID APPEAL
David Swanson, U.N. regional spokesperson for the Syria crisis, said $336 million was urgently needed to help those being displaced, with shelter a critical problem.
""This crisis continues to deteriorate by the minute.  This is easily one of the largest waves of displacements since the (Syrian civil war) began in March 2011,"" Swanson said.
""Hundreds of thousands of people are in now in urgent need of critical, life-saving assistance,"" he said.
The United Nations has put the number of displaced from the Idlib fighting since Dec. 1 at 520,000, with a further 280,000 seen at ""imminent risk of displacement"".
Many of the displaced are staying with host communities who themselves are struggling to cope, while others have sought shelter in schools or mosques, or are sleeping in their vehicles or in the open air, said Swanson.
""The humanitarian situation in Syria is more catastrophic than ever before. Who would have imagined that entire cities would be displaced in a single month?"" said Atef Nanou, manager of Molham Volunteering Team, a relief group in northern Syria.
He said he had encountered families unable to get away from the bombing because they couldn't afford fuel for their car or transportation costs.
""So they either stayed despite the bombing or went out on foot on the international road that the Syrian regime and Russian warplanes are bombing around the clock,"" Nanou added."

SEOUL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - At least three Asian businessmen who attended a meeting of more than 100 international delegates at a Singapore hotel have contracted coronavirus, while others are showing symptoms, authorities said on Wednesday.
The cases are further evidence the virus is now spreading through human-to-human contact outside China.
Malaysia on Tuesday said its first infected citizen - a 41-year-old man - had attended the meeting, which included delegations from China where the virus originated, in mid-January.
South Korea also reported two confirmed cases of its citizens who visited the same business conference in Singapore on Wednesday.
The cases are linked to a company business meeting involving 109 participants at the Grand Hyatt Singapore hotel on Jan 20-22, which included 94 overseas participants, Singapore's health ministry said.
Of the Singapore attendees, four have also reported symptoms and been referred to its National Center for Infectious Diseases.
Authorities have not commented on the company or industry involved.
A spokesman for the Grand Hyatt Hotel, Gerald Kheng, said the hotel had been deep cleaned after it was first informed of the incident by Singapore's health ministry on Tuesday but said it was not aware of any other cases among guests or staff.
Singapore - one of the worst hit countries outside China in the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - has reported 28 cases of coronavirus, including some local transmission cases.
The city-state says no evidence has emerged of widespread community spread but it announced new precautionary measures on Tuesday including halting group activities such as school assemblies.
Several firms in Singapore have suspended business and media events, including a big travel fair, but the Singapore Airshow is set to go ahead next week albeit on a smaller scale.
The World Health Organization has said cases of human-to-human transmission outside China are deeply concerning and could signal a much larger outbreak.

Fifty-three people were injured, it said.

Van governor Mehmet Emin Bilmez said earlier that rescue efforts were continuing but did not say how many people were still believed to be trapped.
Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said conditions in the area made it difficult for rescue vehicles to operate, adding that a vehicle had been pulled out from under 4-5 metres (16 feet) of snow.
Osman Ucar, head of AFAD's Van office, was hospitalised after being caught in the avalanche. He told Ihlas News Agency from hospital that some 200 people were working in the rescue operation but many were out of the immediate area when the second avalanche hit on Wednesday.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's new government must be broad-based to implement sorely needed reforms, the leader of the largest party in parliament said on Wednesday, in comments that signaled the country could face a snap election.
Tunisian politicians have been struggling to build a new government since an inconclusive election last October. Tunisia also faces pressing economic problems, nine years after the overthrow of veteran autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.
Prime Minister-designate Elyes Fakhfakh wants to exclude from his proposed coalition the second biggest party in parliament, the secularist Heart of Tunisia, saying it is not aligned with the values of the uprising that toppled Ben Ali.
But the leader of the biggest party, the moderate Islamist Ennahda, said parliament would not back such a government.
""If the prime minister-designate excludes the Heart of Tunisia party, the government will not... gain the confidence of parliament,"" said Rached Ghannouchi, who is also the speaker of parliament.
""Ennahda wants a unity government that does not exclude any party because the next government needs wide partisan support to implement urgent reforms,"" he said.
Ennahda has been the most consistently powerful force in Tunisian politics since the 2011 revolution that introduced democracy, playing a major part in successive governments and coming first in several elections.
However, its vote share and number of seats declined in the October election and its efforts to shape a new governing coalition came to nothing last month.
Fakhfakh, a former finance minister, was nominated by Tunisia's president, Kais Saied, an independent.
Ghannouchi said on Wednesday the choice of Fakhfakh was not the best. He also criticized the president for not taking part in a conference in Berlin on Libya's future or in the annual gathering of global business leaders in Davos.
Analysts said the comments suggest Ennahda fears that Saied will replace the party as the most influential actor in Tunisian politics. Saied won last year's presidential election with a low-key campaign that stressed his personal integrity at a time of public anger over perceived corruption among politicians.
If Fakhfakh is unable to forge a new government, Tunisia will have to hold another parliamentary election, further delaying efforts to tackle the country's economic problems.
Unemployment stands at more than 15% nationally, and is as high as 30% in some cities, while inflation is high, the currency is weak and successive governments have struggled to rein in high fiscal deficits and control the public debt."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand has scrapped a Chinese-led project to blast rapids on the Mekong River that had been opposed by local people and environmental groups, a government spokeswoman said on Wednesday.
China initiated a plan to dredge the Mekong River in 2001 to make room for large ships to carry goods from its landlocked southern province of Yunnan to ports in Thailand, Laos, and the rest of Southeast Asia. 
The plan had been opposed by conservationists and communities in Thailand living along the Mekong River. They feared it would harm the environment and benefit only China.
The Thai cabinet agreed to scrap the dredging plan during a weekly meeting on Tuesday.
""The communities affected and non-profit groups were against the plan, fearing it would affect the way of life, and China also had no funding for it ... So we ended the project,"" said Trisulee Trisaranakul, a deputy government spokeswoman.
""It didn't take off yet. We were only doing environmental and social impact assessments,"" she told Reuters.
The Chinese embassy in Bangkok was not immediately available for comment.
A Thai cabinet document said that China had in any case informed countries on the Mekong River last year that it was not planning to pursue the project, but work had continued on stretches of the river in Laos and Myanmar.

The Mekong flows from China, where it is known as the Lancang river, through five southeast Asian countries.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The corruption trial of Rosmah Mansor, the wife of Malaysia's former Prime Minister Najib Razak, began on Wednesday, with a prosecutor describing how she exerted ""considerable influence"" over government decisions.
Accusations of graft on a massive scale, were leveled against the couple after Najib lost a general election in 2018. They have both denied all charges, labeling them politically motivated.
Najib now faces dozens of graft and money laundering charges linked to the plunder of funds from sovereign fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd. During a break from one of his own ongoing trials, Najib came to see Rosmah, 67, on her first day in the dock.
During that brief visit Najib spoke to his wife and her lawyers, giving her a little hug before leaving the court.
Rosmah faces three charges of soliciting and receiving bribes involving a sum of 194 million ringgit ($45.93 million) to help a company, Jepak Holdings Sdn Bhd, secure a solar power project.
Of that total, prosecutors accuse Rosmah of arranging for 187 million ringgit to be paid as a political donation to Najib, while also receiving two bribes of 6.5 million ringgit. 
The trial had been due to start on Monday, but was delayed as the defense said Rosmah was too ill to attend.
Sitting in the dock behind her legal team, dressed in a green floral baju kurung, a traditional Malay long smock and dress, and wearing a headscarf, Rosmah appeared calm throughout the first day's proceedings.
Prosecutors argued that Rosmah had put herself in a position where she was able to influence decisions by the government, particularly the award of the a 1.25 billion ringgit solar power project for rural schools in the eastern state of Sarawak, on the island of Borneo.
""By herself, she occupied no official position. However, she wielded considerable influence by reason of her overbearing nature,"" Gopal Sri Ram, who leads the prosecution, said in his opening statement.

High Court Judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan dismissed the objection from defense counsel Jagjit Singh that the prosecution's characterization of Rosmah as ""overbearing"" amounted to character assassination.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Thousands of passengers and crew on two cruise ships in Asian waters were placed in quarantine for China's coronavirus on Wednesday as airlines, car manufacturers and other global companies counted the cost of the fast-spreading outbreak.
China said another 65 people had died as of Tuesday, the highest daily total yet, taking the overall toll on the mainland to 490, most in and around the locked-down central city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year.
There have been two deaths outside mainland China, both following visits to Wuhan. A man in the Philippines died last week, and a 39-year-old man with an underlying illness died in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong on Tuesday.
The virus had disrupted air travel, with more than two dozen airlines suspending or restricting flights to China and several countries, including the United States, banning the entry of anyone who has been in China over the previous two weeks.
Taiwan banned the entry of mainland residents from Thursday.
The disruption spread to cruise ships this week, with about 3,700 people facing at least two weeks locked away on a liner anchored off Japan after health officials confirmed that 10 people aboard had tested positive for the virus.
Passengers on the Diamond Princess posted pictures online of officials in masks and gowns conducting health checks and an empty deck.
""This is not a good situation,"" British passenger David Abel said in a video shot in his cabin and posted to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
In Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers and crew were confined to their ship docked in the city for tests after three people on board had tested positive earlier.
Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) asked its 27,000 employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave, saying conditions were as grave now as during the 2009 financial crisis.
 American Airlines Group  (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) said they would suspend flights to and from Hong Kong after this week, a step that would leave no U.S. carriers flying passengers to the Asian financial hub.
Nearly $700 billion was wiped off mainland Chinese stocks on Monday with many factories shut, cities cut off and travel links constricted, fuelling worries about global supply chains. Asian stocks steadied on Wednesday.
 Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) will suspend production in South Korea because of a disruption to the supply of parts, it said, becoming the first major carmaker to do so outside of China.
Global carmakers have already extended factory closures in China in line with government guidelines. These include Hyundai, Tesla (O:TSLA), Ford (N:F), PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP), Nissan (T:7201) and Honda Motor
IMPACT ON TRADE DEAL
Planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) has prolonged a planned closure of its final assembly plant in Tianjin, China, it said.
Taiwan's Foxconn (TW:2317), which makes phones for global vendors including Apple (O:AAPL), aims to gradually restart factories in China next week but could take at least a week or two more to resume full production, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the epidemic would delay a surge in U.S. exports to China expected from a Phase 1 trade deal set to take effect this month.
Japan's central bank was ready to ramp up stimulus measures for the world's third-biggest economy, citing uncertainty over the virus.
Evidence of human-to-human spread outside China surfaced after an international business gathering in Singapore in January was linked to virus cases reported in Malaysia and South Korea, but authorities did not comment on its nature or the industry involved.
Singapore - one of the worst hit countries outside China in the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - has reported 24 cases of the new coronavirus.
Across mainland China, there were 3,887 new confirmed infections of the coronavirus, making a total of 24,324. Nearly 230 cases have been reported in some 27 countries and regions outside mainland China, a Reuters tally based on official statements shows.
Macau, a gambling hub and like Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, ordered casinos to suspend operations on Tuesday, effectively halting the lifeblood of its economy.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency, but experts say its mortality and transmission rates are unknown. Pregnant women may be able to pass it to their unborn children, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.
Asked about various media reports of ""drug breakthroughs"", WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: ""There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV.""
Russia said it would take between eight and 10 months to develop a vaccine, the Interfax news agency reported. Scores of Russians began two weeks of quarantine in Siberia on Wednesday after being flown home from Wuhan.
Beijing has criticized as an overreaction U.S. travel curbs that bar foreign nationals who have visited China.
""We have the ability and confidence to finally win this war of containment,"" China's state councillor Wang Yi told Thailand's foreign minister.
A Thai taxi-driver who recovered from the infection told reporters in Bangkok of his shock at catching it and had a message of support for Wuhan.
""If I can beat it, so can you.""

1477,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 07:49AM ET</span>",Airline conflict alert system given new impetus after plane downed by Iran: IATA,"By Alexander Cornwell
DOHA (Reuters) - The shooting down of a Ukrainian airliner near Tehran has given new urgency to efforts to develop a shared conflict alert system for airlines, the head of the world's biggest airline body said on Wednesday.
Iranian air defense units said they mistakenly shot down Ukrainian International Airlines flight PS752, killing all 176 people on board, shortly after it took off from Tehran airport on Jan. 8. At the time, they were on heightened alert because of increased tensions with the United States.
The incident has renewed calls for an effective conflict alert system for airlines. Concerns were also heightened in 2014 when Malaysia Airlines MH17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 on board.
""There will be something to be done again,"" International Air Transport Association Chief Executive Alexandre de Juniac told Reuters at a CAPA aviation summit in Doha.
IATA represents about 290 airlines, or more than 80% of global air traffic.
After the Malaysian Airlines flight was shot down, IATA backed the creation by the United Nations' aviation agency, ICAO, of a conflict zone website that would alert airlines and pilots of possible dangers. But the site was closed after complaints from some countries over information sharing.
""It's not a reason to give up. The shooting of the Ukrainian airliner is an additional reason not to give up but to continue and be successful,"" de Juniac said.
Air safety experts say there is inadequate government intelligence sharing and some countries involved in conflicts are reluctant to divulge information or sacrifice overflight fees by shutting their skies.
Some airlines began avoiding Iraqi and Iranian airspace after the United States killed a top Iranian commander, an incident that raised tensions before flight PS752 was shot down.
De Juniac said a dedicated body that issues guidelines - rather than mandatory decisions - on whether to overfly certain zones could be more palatable to those who had opposed the mechanism. This ""could be a significant improvement,"" he said."

Despite divisions over Iran, Pompeo has sought to re-establish friendlier ties with the incoming leaders of the European Union, including Borrell, and mark an end to troubled relations since President Donald Trump took office.

The Law and Justice (PiS) party has vowed to pursue judicial reforms that critics say have marginalized Poland in the EU, but a defeat for the incumbent, PiS ally Andrzej Duda, would threaten the government's agenda as the president has the power to veto laws.
""This year we have very important elections,"" Elzbieta Witek, the parliamentary speaker, told reporters. ""The presidential elections will be held on May 10.""
Duda is ahead in the polls, with a survey in the weekly Polityka giving him 41.7% in the first round. Opponents include Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska of the center-right Civic Platform, and Robert Biedron of the Left grouping.
If nobody gets more than 50% of votes, a second round is held two weeks later, and the candidate with the most votes wins.
On Tuesday, Duda stepped up the conflict with Brussels by signing a law that critics say aims to muzzle judges critical of the government's reforms. Poland has also clashed with the EU over migration and climate change, among other issues. 
PiS won a second term in October on the back of promises to raise living standards to match those of the West and hefty social handouts.

However, the party lost control of the upper house, the Senate. While the Senate can delay bills and its speaker, Tomasz Grodzki, has taken a prominent role in opposing PiS's judicial policies, it cannot block bills entirely, a power reserved for the president.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Around 3,700 people are facing at least two weeks locked away on a cruise liner anchored off Japan after health officials confirmed on Wednesday that 10 people on the ship had tested positive for coronavirus and more cases were possible.
While the infected patients were transferred by Japan's coast guard to hospitals on the mainland, the rest of the passengers and crew on board the Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp ship were placed in quarantine and given health screenings. The 10 cases were among 31 results received so far from 273 people tested.
Passengers on Carnival's Diamond Princess, which had arrived in Yokohama on Monday after a 14-day round trip, will now spend another two weeks on the ship off Yokohama port near Tokyo.
They took to social media to detail their predicament, posting photos of officials in masks and gowns conducting health checks, room service meals and empty corridors and decks.
British passenger David Abel said passengers were confined to their cabins on Wednesday morning, with staff delivering food room-by-room.
""The challenging situation for me is that I'm an insulin dependent diabetic,"" Abel said in a video taken in his cabin and posted to his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, adding that regular and timed food intake was a key part of managing his condition.
""We don't have a choice in what we can eat, the announcement recently was that they're starting on the bottom deck and working their way up - I'm on the ninth deck.""
A 43-year-old Hong Kong resident on the ship with six family members said they had been given coffee and water, but no food, by lunchtime on Wednesday. They were hungry but had snacks of their own, he said.
""I am not looking forward to the range of emotions in the next two weeks,"" he told Reuters from his family's windowless room, declining to be named. ""Will deal as they come.""
Another passenger, using the handle @daxa_tw, tweeted that he was ""hearing from many sides that people are troubled and uneasy"".
Carnival's Princess Cruises said quarantined passengers would get free internet and telephone services and the crew was working to keep them comfortable.
The ship was caught up in the global coronavirus epidemic after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man tested positive for the virus after disembarking in Hong Kong on Jan. 25. The man had joined a shore excursion in Kagoshima, southwestern Japan, on Jan. 22, local media reported.
He was believed to have been in close contact with 36 passengers, Kyodo news reported, citing Japan's health ministry. Two of those people are among the 10 who have already tested positive, Kyodo said.
Separately, public broadcaster NHK said a man in his 40s, who was visiting Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo, from China's Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, had tested positive. That brought the total number of people infected in Japan to 34.
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said officials would continue to monitor the remaining passengers and crew for the potential development of symptoms.
None of the 10 infected people - three each from Japan and Hong Kong, two Australians, one American and one Filipino crew member - had severe symptoms, NHK reported.
FREE TRIP, RED WINE
Carnival said quarantined passengers would get a full refund and a future cruise credit.
The ship would go out to sea to perform ""normal marine operations"", it added, including the production of fresh water, before receiving food and other supplies from Yokohama.
Not all passengers were overly concerned about their situation. American Ashley Rhodes-Courter posted a text message exchange on Instagram with her parents, Gay and Phil Courter, who are on board the ship.
""The food is great, the staff is in good spirits and we're all in the same boat,"" the couple said, ""plus they have not run out of some great Pinot noir."""

DOHA (Reuters) - An American university's partner in Qatar has rejected the university's explanation for cancelling an event in Doha that would have featured a prominent Middle East band whose singer is openly gay.
Members of Lebanese indie rock band Mashrou' Leila had been scheduled to take part in a discussion at Northwestern University’s Qatar campus on Tuesday, but the university moved the event to its U.S. campus after hostile online comments against Mashrou’ Leila’s appearance.
Northwestern cited ""safety concerns"" for the band and its community, among other, unspecified factors.
But Qatar Foundation, a state-linked non-profit body in the conservative Gulf Arab state, challenged the reasons given by Northwestern.
Asked about Northwestern's comments, a Qatar Foundation spokesman told Reuters: ""We place the utmost importance on the safety of our community and currently do not have any safety or security concerns.""
""We also place the very highest value on academic freedom and the open exchange of knowledge, ideas and points of view in the context of Qatari laws as well as the country’s cultural and social customs. This particular event was canceled due to the fact that it patently did not correlate with this context.”
Northwestern has not detailed its safety concerns.
Critics of the event demanded on social media that it be canceled. Some accused Mashrou' Leila and the university of spreading views that are against Qatari and Islamic values. Others said they opposed same-sex relationships.
Gay sex is punishable by jail in Qatar, as in many Muslim-majority countries.
Mashrou' Leila has garnered international acclaim with lyrics tackling issues of sectarianism, gender equality and homophobia.
A vocal supporter of equal rights for marginalized groups, the band has also had other events canceled in the Middle East following pressure by conservative groups."

Shelling by Syrian government forces killed eight Turkish military personnel on Monday, prompting Turkish forces to strike back. The escalation raised concerns over future collaboration between Ankara and Moscow, which have backed opposing sides in the war despite joint efforts to ease the violence.
Erdogan said two of Turkey's 12 observation posts, set up around a ""de-escalation zone"" in northwest Syria's Idlib region as part of a 2017 agreement with Russia and Iran, were now behind Syrian government front lines.
""We hope that the process of the regime pulling back behind our observation posts is completed in the month of February,"" he told members of his AK Party. ""If the regime does not pull back during this time, Turkey will have to do this job itself.""
He said the Turkish military would carry out air and ground operations in Idlib, when necessary.
Erdogan has said Moscow, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Ankara, which has backed rebels who tried to topple him, should resolve the conflict ""without anger"" and agreed with Russian President Vladimir Putin to improve coordination of their countries' actions in Syria.
The violence in Idlib has accelerated in recent months despite several ceasefire efforts, including as recently as January, displacing hundreds of thousands of people.
U.N. regional spokesman David Swanson said 520,000 people had been displaced since the beginning of December and the numbers could swell further.

Erdogan said nearly one million people were moving toward the Turkish border and Syrian territory under Turkish control. ""No one has the right to place such a weight on our shoulders,"" he said.

1483,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 05:13AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. halts secretive drone program with Turkey over Syria incursion,"By Humeyra Pamuk and Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has halted a secretive military intelligence cooperation program with Turkey that for years helped Ankara target Kurdish PKK militants, four U.S. officials told Reuters.
The U.S. decision to indefinitely suspend the program, which has not been previously reported, was made in response to Turkey's cross-border military incursion into Syria in October, the U.S. officials said, revealing the extent of the damage to ties between the NATO allies from the incident.
The U.S. officials, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the United States late last year stopped flying the intelligence collection missions that targeted the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which both the United States and Turkey classify as terrorists.
The U.S. military had carried out the missions using unarmed drone aircraft, which one official said were flown out of Turkey's Incirlik air base, where the U.S. military has a significant presence. The base is also a key hub for U.S. spy agencies operating in the region.
The U.S. drone flights that took place within the program, in place since 2007, often zeroed in on mountainous territory in northern Iraq near the Turkish border, another official said.
A Pentagon spokeswoman did not directly comment on any specific programs but noted that the United States has designated the PKK a terrorist organization since 1997.
“We have supported Turkey in their fight against the PKK in many ways for decades. As a matter of policy, we do not provide details on operational matters,” the spokeswoman said, when asked about a halt in assistance.
A State Department spokesperson said the United States does not comment on intelligence matters.
Officials from the Turkish defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment, but a Turkish official confirmed the program was stopped.
The halt to U.S. assistance will test the limits of Turkey's military and intelligence capabilities at a time when its forces are already deployed on multiple fronts in northern Syria and as Ankara mulls deeper engagement in Libya.
""This makes the anti-PKK campaign more difficult and more costly for Turkey,"" one of the four U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said.
It also adds to a laundry list of grievances between the United States and Turkey, including Ankara's purchase of Russian air defenses and broader splits over the war in Syria, despite what appears to be a strong relationship between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan.
""In recent years, Turkey has not been struggling to obtain the information it needs through drones it produces itself,"" the Turkish official said. ""However, as an ally the steps taken on this issue do not contribute to ties between the two countries.""
SPLITS OVER SYRIA
Trump, long a skeptic of U.S. military involvement in Syria, has been blamed by Democrats and even some Republicans for abandoning the U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters to the Turkish onslaught, and in so doing, unraveling U.S. policy.
The Turkish offensive took aim at Kurdish YPG militia in Syria, who had been America's top allies in the battle against Islamic State.
Turkey views the YPG as a terrorist organization, indistinguishable from the PKK. But U.S. policy has long drawn a bright line between the two groups, helping Turkey combat the PKK even as U.S. military forces simultaneously partnered with the YPG militia to combat Islamic State.
The PKK took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984, waging an insurgency for autonomy in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast. Since then, more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Kurds, as an ethnic group, form about 20 percent of Turkey's population.
Turkey's military has often struck targets in Iraq's Kurdish region near the PKK's stronghold in the Qandil mountains and has also carried out cross-border operations into northern Iraq targeting the militant group.
Since the inception of the secretive U.S. intelligence cooperation program, Ankara has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to advance its own defense capabilities and reduced its dependence on U.S. and Israeli drones which it frequently used since the late 1990s.
Turkey's privately-owned Baykar Defense, whose management involves Selcuk Bayraktar, a son-in-law of Erdogan, began working on developing Turkey's first drone fleet since the 2000s.
Within a decade and a half, it has developed armed and unarmed drones and begun selling them to the Turkish army as well as to Ukraine and Qatar. As of July 2019, a total of 86 Bayraktar drones are in service with Turkey's security forces and some of those have been regularly used during Ankara's three Syria operations in 2016, in 2018 and again last October.
Arda Mevlutoglu, a Turkey-based defense analyst said the recent advance has equipped Ankara with greater flexibility and freedom in its operational capabilities.
""Turkey’s dependence on her allies, mainly to the U.S., significantly decreased, if not completely ended in real-time high-quality intelligence gathering and surgical strike type operations,"" Mevlutoglu said."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The bodies of two U.S. firefighters killed battling Australian blazes were sent home on Wednesday in emotional ceremonies attended by officials and relatives.
Mourners gathered on the tarmac at Sydney Airport to see off Captain Ian H. McBeth, 44, of Great Falls, Montana, and First Officer Paul Clyde Hudson, 42, of Buckeye, Arizona, as their flag-draped caskets were lifted into aircraft for the journey home.
Fire trucks were parked nearby with their emergency lights flashing.
The men and a third American, flight engineer Rick A. DeMorgan Jr, 43, of Navarre, Florida, were killed in a plane crash in remote bushland while battling fires on Jan. 23, in one of the deadliest days of Australia's most destructive bushfire season in a generation.
The three were among hundreds of North American firefighters who joined an international effort to tackle the fires that have killed eight firefighters and 33 people in total.
As searing temperatures and strong winds subsided, and weather forecasters predicted several days of rain, Australia has turned its attention to the emotional toll after months of near-constant emergency warnings and toxic smoke across the southeast.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison suspended the first day of parliament after the summer break on Tuesday to lead a tribute to fire victims.
On Wednesday, senior U.S. embassy officials along with top Australian fire and emergency service officers stood at attention alongside relatives of the men as hearses slowly crossed the tarmac to the planes which would carry them home.
Representatives of Coulson Aviation, the private Canadian company that employed the trio and owned the C-130 tanker which crashed, were at the ceremonies.
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating the crash which occurred after the air tanker dumped retardant on a huge wildfire in mountains in a national park south of Canberra, the capital. 
The third man killed in the crash, DeMorgan, would be honored at a ceremony at a military base north of Sydney on Saturday before his remains were returned home.

Palestinians say the policy has deprived them of large areas of farmland, cut into livelihoods and reduced the space available to the densely populated strip's two million residents.
Under the ICRC project, launched in 2015, members of the Hamas-led Interior Ministry have cleared unexploded ordnance and other war material from 40 percent of the 2,500 acres (1,012 hectares) that make up the borderlands in that tract.
Abu Isaeed was one of 90 farmers whose lands were being rehabilitated by ICRC in the project's third phase which began last August and will end with the harvest in May. In all, the ICRC said some 580 farmers have regained access to their land. 
Fields were plowed, fertilized and sown with wheat by ICRC-employed workers as part of the endeavor, organized in cooperation with Israeli authorities, Gaza's Agriculture Ministry, local municipalities and farmers' committees.
""We risk death every time we enter the land,"" said Serhey Abu Mandeel, 71, noting its proximity to the border, which is closely monitored by the Israeli military. He and his family owned 12 acres planted with peas, soybeans, wheat and lentils.
Like other Palestinian farmers, Abu Mandeel complained that herbicides sprayed by cropdusters inside Israel were being carried by winds across the border into Gaza and harming fields there. 
Farmers said the herbicides have killed their crops. Gaza's Agriculture Ministry put their losses at $1.25 million since last December. 

""We believe there should be a balance between security concerns and the impact of the herbicides on public health, the environment and the livelihoods of local people,"" Gaza ICRC spokeswoman Suhair Zakkout told Reuters, adding they were in discussion with Israel over the issue.

Cameron was on his way back from New York to London with a protection officer from Britain's Metropolitan Police when the discovery sparked a security incident, according to the reports.
The Sun newspaper, citing other passengers who were present, said the British Airways plane was waiting to take off when a shocked passenger said he had found a gun in the toilet, causing a commotion.
""The captain confirmed a gun had been found, which freaked everyone out,"" the Sun quoted one of the passengers as saying.
Seeking to reassure passengers, the captain told them the protection officer was authorized to bring a gun on board and it had now been returned to him, but several travelers objected and the weapon was removed before take-off.
The Metropolitan Police said they were taking the matter extremely seriously and had launched an internal investigation.
""We are aware of the incident on a flight into the UK on 3 February and the officer involved has since been removed from operational duties,"" the police said in a statement.
British Airways said it followed Civil Aviation Authority rules which allow UK police to carry firearms on board in specific, controlled circumstances.
""Our crew dealt with the issue quickly before departure and the flight continued as normal,"" the airline said.
Cameron, who resigned as prime minister in 2016 after a referendum on Britain's European Union membership delivered the opposite result to the one he had campaigned for, has his own track record of forgetfulness.
In 2012, two years into his premiership, he accidentally left his eight-year-old daughter in a pub after lunch, returning to get her 15 minutes later."

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - More than 130 Salvadorans have been killed after being deported from the United States since 2013, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Wednesday, and it stressed the danger migrants face under the Trump administration's hardening immigration policy.
In a report titled ""Deported to Danger,"" the group said it had documented 138 cases of Salvadorans who had been killed after deportation, but stressed the number was likely much higher as there are no official figures.
HRW also found more than 70 cases of deported Salvadorans who suffered sexual violence, torture or other harm, or who disappeared.
President Donald Trump has toughened U.S. immigration policy to make it difficult for Central Americans to seek asylum, forcing thousands to wait in Mexico as their cases are decided. The issue promises to be a cornerstone of his reelection campaign.
""As asylum and immigration policies tighten in the United States and dire security problems continue in El Salvador, the U.S. is repeatedly violating its obligations to protect Salvadorans from return to serious risk of harm,"" HRW wrote.
The report placed blame on Salvadoran gangs for targeting deportees and the Salvadoran government for failing to protect them. It accused the United States of ""putting Salvadorans in harm's way in circumstances where it knows or should know that harm is likely.""
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the report, HRW said it established a connection in many cases between the reasons Salvadorans had fled their country and the ultimate causes of their deaths.
The report cites the case of Camila Diaz Cordova, a 29-year-old transgender person who applied for asylum in the United States in August 2017 to escape death threats and extortion by multi-national gang Barrio 18.
After her deportation in November 2017, she returned to sex work in San Salvador, the capital, where she was kidnapped and beaten to death by the police, according to a close friend of Diaz Cordova and Salvador's attorney general.
""By losing her bid for asylum or refuge in the United States, or anywhere else, the risk she faced was exactly that: being killed,"" the friend of Diaz Cordova said in an interview.
Many other deported migrants say their lives are in danger back home.
Luis, 41, worked nearly two decades in California until he was deported in 2015 after failing to appear for an immigration hearing. Luis, who did not wish to use his full name due to fear of reprisals, found work as a bus driver on the outskirts of San Salvador but was perceived as an outsider and a threat by local gangs.
Gang members shot at him and a bullet struck the bus once, though Luis escaped unscathed.
""They said if they saw me again, they would take me out,"" Luis told Reuters. The threats have subsided since he began making payments to gangs to be able to drive through their territory, he said."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia is to hold a wide-ranging inquiry into suicides among military veterans and will appoint a permanent commissioner to try to curb the death rate, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday.
Australia, which has more than 3,000 troops deployed around the world, joins the United States, Britain and Canada in exploring ways to prevent suicide rates among serving and former military personnel.
Some 419 Australian defense personnel have died from suicide since 2001, which is 18% higher than in non-military Australians, according to a government report last year.
Morrison has been under pressure to tackle the issue amid a high-profile campaign by Julie-Ann Finney, whose son David, a former naval petty officer, committed suicide last year.
""Too many young Australians have taken their own lives, and we need concerted actions in all of these areas to ensure that we're doing everything we possibly can to prevent this,"" the prime minister told reporters in Canberra.
A permanent commissioner will head the inquiry and will be able to investigate individual cases of suspected and attempted suicide, as well as make recommendations to support suicide prevention and improve mental health and wellbeing.
The commissioner, who has yet to appointed, will deliver a report to the Parliament within 12 months.
In 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing government departments to try to prevent suicide among military veterans by treating mental health problems before they become more serious.
According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 6,139 U.S. veterans died by suicide in 2017, a rate 1.5 times higher than for non-veteran adults."

PAJU, South Korea (Reuters) - For the first time in 10 years, Kong Ji-ye's chocolate-making machines sit idle in Paju city, near the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that separates the two Koreas.
Not because of shelling, nuclear tests or general sabre-rattling from the North. Her business is at a standstill because an outbreak of a virus that kills pigs but can't harm humans triggered a ban on tours that bring hundreds of thousands of South Korean and foreign visitors to the border with the North.
Kong, 47, makes souvenir chocolates for tourists on their way to the DMZ. But four months ago Seoul halted all DMZ tours in a bid to stop the spread of African swine fever from the North - the disease can be transmitted by human traffic and has decimated pig herds in the South and across Asia.
The chocolate maker is just one of tens of thousands of people in thousands of businesses whose livelihood depends on tourism in Paju, a city of about 460,000 about an hour north of Seoul: With revenue down to a trickle, Kong has had to borrow money to keep staff on her books - though two have already quit - and the future looks bleak unless the ban is reversed soon.
""The tours were suspended following North Korea's shelling on Yeonpyeong island (in 2010) for safety reasons, but since then this is the first time the tours were completely suspended,"" said Kong in an interview at her DMZ Dreamfood factory, methodically folding empty chocolate boxes. 
The extreme response by Seoul is because South Korea suspects the fever spread from the North: The South's first confirmed case in September was at a pig farm in Paju, less than four months after North Korea's own outbreak.
No new cases have been reported at farms in South Korea since Oct. 10, but infected wild boars still roam the DMZ, with more than a third of those that have been found dead discovered inside Paju city-limits, according to data from the National Institute of Environmental Research. 
FENCES, HUNTS, PROTESTS
To try to cut risks, Paju has set up fences to try to block wild boars from crossing into tourist spots as well as stepping up efforts to hunt the animals, an official at Paju city hall said.
In early January, Kong joined hundreds of Paju citizens ranging from restaurant owners to tour operators in a protest demonstration urging Seoul to lift the tour ban and provide measures to support them. 
An agriculture ministry official said Paju must continue to hunt wild boars through February before swine fever-related ministries decide whether it is safe for tours to resume. 
Park Sung-jun, executive director at Cosmo-Jin Travel Agency in Paju, also said the fever has taken a heavy toll on business, since DMZ tour packages typically account for 40% of revenue.
""The swine fever hit tourism and that's caused a direct blow to the wrong industry,"" said Park.
For Kong, there's little left to do for now but fold boxes for the chocolates she hopes to start selling to tourists, at about $10 apiece, as soon as the ban is lifted.
""I thought it would be for a week, not four months and it's really hard because not once has this ever happened,"" she said.

The draft text, circulated to council members by Tunisia and Indonesia, would seemingly face a U.S. veto, but nonetheless offered some members’ dim view of the peace plan that Trump rolled out last week with great fanfare.
Diplomats said negotiations on the text would likely begin later this week. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is expected to speak to the council next week about the plan, possibly coinciding with a vote on the draft resolution.
The resolution “stresses the illegality of the annexation of any part” of occupied Palestinian territories and “condemns recent statements calling for annexation by Israel” of these territories, according to the draft seen by Reuters.
Trump’s plan, the product of three years effort by senior adviser Jared Kushner, would recognize Israel’s authority over the settlements and would require the Palestinians to meet a highly difficult series of conditions to be allowed to have a state, with its capital in a West Bank village east of Jerusalem.
Kushner is due to brief Security Council ambassadors on the plan on Thursday.
While the Palestinians have rejected the plan, a number of Arab governments have said it represents a starting point for a renewal of long-stalled negotiations.
The resolution stresses the need for an acceleration of international and regional efforts to launch “credible negotiations on all final status issues in the Middle East peace process without exception.”
A U.S. veto at the council level would allow the Palestinians to take the draft text to the 193-member U.N. General Assembly, where a vote would publicly show how Trump's peace plan has been received internationally."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nigeria has begun working on the security and information sharing requirements for the lifting of a U.S. travel ban on prospective immigrants from the African nation, Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama said on Tuesday. 
Speaking at a joint news conference in Washington with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Onyeama said Nigeria was 'blindsided' by the U.S. decision on Friday to add it and five other nations to an expanded version of the U.S. visa ban.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued an expanded version of his travel ban on Friday as part of a presidential proclamation which said Washington would suspend the issuance of visas that can lead to permanent residency for nationals of Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar and Nigeria.
Temporary visas for tourists, business people, students and workers from those nations will not be affected, it said.
U.S. officials said the countries failed to meet U.S. security and information-sharing standards, which necessitated the new restrictions.
""We've identified all those requirements and we had actually started working on all them,"" Onyeama said. ""It was very gratifying to come here, speaking to U.S. officials and to understand more clearly the reasoning behind this.""
Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa, is the biggest country on the list whose citizens will be suspended from U.S. visas that can lead to permanent residency.
Pompeo also said Nigeria could do more in sharing important national security information, adding that he was 'optimistic' that Abuja would move in that direction.
He said some of the areas were security measures taken with regards to passports and information about criminal histories and suspected terrorist information being made available.
""With regards to lost and stolen passports, we’re putting in place the architecture that will now make that – the information and the data on that - immediately available to the U.S. and all the member states, member countries of Interpol,"" Onyeama said.
He added that once all the criteria was met, Nigeria was looking forward to being taken off this visa restriction list. He did not predict a time frame.
The original travel ban, issued in 2017, barred nearly all immigrants and travelers from seven countries with majority Muslim populations. The policy was revised amid court challenges, but the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately upheld it in 2018.
Trump has made tougher immigration enforcement a central focus of his 2020 re-election campaign. His travel ban policy is popular with Republican supporters.

The new travel ban will take effect on Feb. 21, according to the proclamation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department said on Tuesday the Navy had fielded a low-yield, submarine-launched ballistic missile warhead, something the Pentagon believes is needed to deter adversaries like Russia but which critics say lowers the threshold for using nuclear weapons.
Low-yield nuclear weapons, while still devastating, have a strength of less than 20 kilotons. The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, in August 1945, had about the same explosive power.
""This supplemental capability strengthens deterrence and provides the United States a prompt, more survivable low-yield strategic weapon,"" John Rood, the under secretary of defense for policy, said in a statement.
""(It) supports our commitment to extended deterrence; and demonstrates to potential adversaries that there is no advantage to limited nuclear employment because the United States can credibly and decisively respond to any threat scenario,"" Rood added.
A 2018 Pentagon document called for the military to expand its low-yield nuclear capability, saying the United States would modify a small number of submarine-launched ballistic missile warheads with low-yield options.
""The administration's decision to deploy the W76-2 warhead remains a misguided and dangerous one. The deployment of this warhead does nothing to make Americans safer,"" Democratic Representative Adam Smith, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.
Arms control advocates and some lawmakers have argued that such low-yield weapons reduce the threshold for potentially using nuclear weapons and could make a nuclear conflict more likely. The United States already has air-launched, low-yield nuclear weapons and critics say that should be sufficient. 
""President Trump now has a more usable nuclear weapon that is a dangerous solution in search of a problem,"" said Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association advocacy group.
The argument for these weapons is that larger nuclear bombs are so catastrophic that they would never be used, meaning they are not an effective deterrent. With less power and destruction, the low-yield option would potentially be more likely to be used, serving as an effective deterrent, military officials have said.

The Federation of American Scientists said last week that the Navy was scheduled to deploy the low-yield warhead on the USS Tennessee in the Atlantic Ocean.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's 2020 presidential election will be contested by eight candidates who registered by a Monday deadline to compete in the re-run of a fraught October ballot that sparked protests and led to the downfall of long-term leftist leader Evo Morales.
The May 3 election will see a fair share of controversy with caretaker President Jeanine Anez running despite criticism that she is overstepping her interim mandate, while Morales is eyeing a return from exile in Argentina to be candidate in the senate.
Conservative Anez, a former senator, will go head-to-head with a number of recent allies, including civic leader Luis Fernando Camacho, former President Jorge Tuto Quiroga and October runner-up Carlos Mesa.
They form a fragmented opposition against Morales' own Movement for Socialism (MAS) party, which has former Economy Minister Luis Arce at the top of the ticket.
Anez, who took over in a political vacuum after the resignation of Morales and a number of his deputies in November, sparked a backlash from allies and opponents alike when she announced plans to run last month.
Morales is directing his party's campaign from Argentina. MAS leads in recent polls against the divided opposition, but not by enough to avoid a second round run-off.
The country's electoral tribunal still needs to formally rubber stamp the candidates as eligible to run, leaving a question mark over whether Morales will be allowed to be a candidate for the senate despite residing overseas.
The landlocked South American nation, which is grappling with economic slowdown, was plunged into political crisis last year over allegations of electoral fraud after Morales won an election handing him a fourth term in defiance of term limits."

Iran's Revolutionary Guards shot down the airliner on Jan. 8, killing all 176 people onboard.
They later admitted they had done so by mistake while on high alert hours after they had fired at U.S. targets in retaliation for a U.S. strike that killed Iranian military commander General Qassem Soleimani.
On Monday, Tehran blamed Ukrainian authorities for leaking what it described as confidential evidence and said it would no longer share material with Ukraine from the investigation.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said on Sunday that the leaked audio recording of an Iranian pilot talking to the control tower in Tehran showed that Iran knew immediately it had shot down the plane despite denying it for days.
Iran's Civil Aviation Organization said in statement on Tuesday that it was not given any warning about missile activity in the hours before the Ukrainian airliner was shot down.
It said it would continue investigating the crash ""and the cooperation with the countries involved in this accident will continue as before"". 
""Of course the expectation from all parties is to avoid politicizing this accident and obstructing the technical and specialized investigation,"" it said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian priests should refrain from the practice of blessing nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction that can inflict indiscriminate loss of life, according to new guidelines being discussed by the Russian Orthodox Church.
During two decades in power, President Vladimir Putin has aligned himself with the Orthodox Church, which has also developed closer ties with the ministry of defense.
Russian priests have long appeared in images sprinkling holy water on submarines, ballistic missiles, Soyuz space rockets and other pieces of hardware as part of rituals to bless them.
But some of that is set to stop if the church approves a document drawn up by an Orthodox Church commission.
""The blessing of military weapons is not reflected in the tradition of the Orthodox Church and does not correspond to the content of the Rite,"" the document, on the Moscow patriarchate's website, says.
Blessing or sanctifying weapons that can kill an ""indefinite number of people"" must be excluded from pastoral practice, it says. 
The proposals will be discussed until June 1 and the public should also take part in the debate, the church's Moscow branch said.

In a striking symbol of close defense-church ties in Russia, the armed forces are building their own sprawling cathedral at a military themed park outside Moscow. It is set to be one of the tallest Orthodox churches in the world.

Lipolelo was shot days before Thabane was sworn in as leader of the mountain kingdom. The couple were involved in divorce proceedings at the time of Lipolelo's death.
He and Maesaiah married two months after the murder.
Thabane last month announced his intention to resign, but gave no reason.

ANKARA/MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday Turkey and Russia should resolve differences over the conflict in Syria's Idlib without anger, after a deadly flare-up in violence challenged the fragile cooperation between Moscow and Ankara.
The two countries support opposing sides in Syria's nearly nine-year war, as well as in Libya's escalating conflict, but have worked together to contain some of the bloodshed and have forged close defense ties in recent years. 
An attack by Russian-backed Syrian government forces that killed eight Turkish military personnel on Monday posed the biggest challenge to Russian-Turkish ties since their 2018 deal to stem fighting in Syria's northwest Idlib region. 
Erdogan told Russian forces on Monday there to ""stand aside"" while Turkey struck dozens of targets in retaliation. Moscow and Ankara then argued about whether Turkey had told Russia it was sending waves of reinforcements into Idlib. 
""There is no need for us to be engaged in a conflict or a serious contradiction with Russia at this stage,"" he was quoted as telling reporters on a flight from Ukraine. 
""We will of course sit down and discuss everything. Not with anger, though. Because those who sit down with anger, get up with losses,"" Erdogan added.
Russia supports President Bashar al-Assad in the war in Syria while Turkey backs rebels who once aimed to topple him. 
Analysts said the relationship should survive the testy spell even while risks remained on the ground in Syria. Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million refugees, fears Russian air strikes and a recent northward surge by Syrian troops threatens to send millions more refugees toward its border.
At the United Nations, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the cessation of hostilities to keep the situation from getting out of control.
""We are particularly worried that now the escalation came into a situation in which we had Turkish army and Syrian army bombing each other,"" Guterres said.
""That, of course, is a change in the nature of (the) conflict that is extremely worrying."" 
A Turkish security official said clashes between Turkish and Syrian forces continued intermittently on Tuesday around Saraqeb, a town 15 km (nine miles) east of Idlib city. 
""Now we see more clearly the limits of the Turkey-Russia cooperation in Syria ... and the question is have we reached a different level of escalation"" given the attacks on Turkish troops, said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat who chairs the Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies.
But ""this episode is not going to lead to a permanent break between Ankara and Moscow. They will find ways to overcome this ... because both sides continue to rely on each other"" to contain the situation in Idlib, he said.
Speaking beyond the Syria conflict, Guterres said ""all situations are different but there is a feeling of growing instability and hair-trigger tensions, which makes everything far more unpredictable and uncontrollable.""
He added: ""Today a wind of madness is sweeping the globe.""
NO EXCUSES
Turkey's foreign minister told his Russian counterpart to rein-in Syrian forces and again warned of retaliation against provocative attacks on Turkish observation posts in Idlib set up under a 2017 agreement with Russia and Iran. 
""We also don't accept the excuse of 'we cannot fully control the regime' here,"" Mevlut Cavusoglu said of Russia.
The Turkish security official said Ankara had no plans to withdraw from its 12 observation posts in the area, even though some are now surrounded by Syrian government forces. 
Moscow says it is concerned about attacks by militants who control Idlib, Syria's last remaining major rebel stronghold.
""... Russia cannot solve this problem alone, but can continue trying to achieve unconditional, sincere and full implementation of the existing agreements on Idlib (by all sides involved),"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with the Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper on Tuesday.
""We are talking to our Turkish partners about this.""
Konstantin Kosachev, a senior Russian lawmaker, called the heightened fighting a ""serious test of the strength of the existing Russian-Turkish agreements"" in both Idlib and in northeast Syria, where the two countries have jointly patrolled. 
The Idlib violence has accelerated in recent months despite several ceasefire efforts, including as recently as January.

U.N. regional spokesman David Swanson said 520,000 people had been displaced since the beginning of December and the numbers could swell further.

Michoacan's attorney general said in a statement late on Monday that eight people died during the arcade shootout in Uruapan, the state's second-largest city. Another person died while receiving medical attention and others were injured.
The youngest victims were aged 12 and 13. Others aged 14, 17 and 18 also died, the prosecutor's office said. Footage on social media showed bodies lying in pools of blood on the floor of the arcade.
Authorities did not give a motive for the attack in Uruapan, a city that has long suffered from high violence as gangs vie to control production and transport of drugs such as crystal meth, and increasingly the lucrative avocado trade.
While it is rare for children to be targeted, drug gang feuds were largely responsible for Mexico's worst recorded year of violence last year, with a record of more than 34,600 victims. Drug gangs in Mexico are also often involved in extorting money from slot machine businesses.
Increasingly, critics have blasted government security measures and low conviction rates.
Mexican media reported the shootout was linked to a dispute between rival cartels seeking to control the trade in synthetic drugs. A spokeswoman for the attorney general declined to comment, adding that the investigations are ongoing.
Uruapan is a major center for the processing and export of avocados grown in orchards that spread across Michoacan's hillsides.
The prosecutor said four shooters had used weapons only authorized for the Mexican military. In the aftermath of the shooting, it said authorities had found 65 9 mm shell casings in the arcade.
Over the weekend, state authorities also reported the discovery of a mass grave of 11 partially decomposed bodies in the Uruapan area as local authorities were searching for a disappeared person.
Last week, the arrest of a senior leader of the Los Viagras gang in the Uruapan area led gang members to burn vehicles and blockade roads."

Prosecution lawyer Ilyas Abdulrahman said their lead witness, the police inspector who led the raid in which the men were arrested, would appear on Wednesday.
The trial in Lagos is seen as a test case for a law that criminalizes homosexuality, which is outlawed in many socially conservative African societies where some religious groups brand it a corrupting Western import. 
On Tuesday the prosecution called police Inspector Ade Adegboye, who said he knew three of the defendants from his ""anti-cultism"" work. He declined to answer questions from the defense and said nothing regarding the charges against the men, who face up to 10 years in jail if convicted. 
The men were arrested in a police raid on a hotel in the Egbeda district of Lagos in August 2018. Police said they were being ""initiated"" into a gay club, but the accused said they were attending a birthday party.
Their case is seen as a test for a Nigerian law that bans gay marriage, punishable by a 14-year jail term, and same-sex ""amorous relationships"". 
The law caused an international outcry when it came into force in 2014. Nobody has yet been convicted under the law, prosecution and defense lawyers in the case have previously told Reuters. 

The trial was previously adjourned twice without opening remarks because the prosecution did not bring its witnesses to court.

But on Tuesday the delegation ""was banned from boarding the flight from Panama City to Caracas, according to a notification received by the airline,"" Copa Airlines, the IACHR said in a statement.
Copa declined to comment. The Venezuelan Ministry of Information did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The IACHR delegation, which has not visited Venezuela since 2002, was led by President Esmeralda Arosemena, Executive Secretary Paulo Abrão; the rapporteur for freedom of expression, Edison Lanza; and two other specialists.
The commission, condemned the move, saying, ""The impediment to entering the country hinders the international human rights obligations assumed by Venezuela (... where) a very serious significant deterioration in the enjoyment of human rights persists.""

ROME (Reuters) - A special tribunal has recommended that far-right League leader Matteo Salvini should stand trial for holding scores of people on board a charity ship last August, in one of his last migrant standoffs as interior minister.
The court's move adds to the mounting legal difficulties of Salvini, who took his party out of government in August in a failed bid to trigger an early election that opinion polls suggested he would win.
In a court document seen by Reuters, magistrates in the Sicilian city of Palermo asked parliament for authorization to continue an investigation into the League leader on suspicion of kidnapping 107 migrants on the Spanish charity boat Open Arms.
The migrants remained stranded at sea until prosecutors ordered the seizure of the ship and the evacuation of the people on board.
""(Salvini) denied, without a proper reason, the (ship's)request for a place of safety sent to his office... knowingly causing an illegitimate deprivation of migrants' personal liberty,"" the court document reads.
It also accuses him of failing to carry out his legal duty as a minister to allow the migrants to disembark.
The court's request was sent to parliament on Jan. 31 but only made public on Tuesday.
During his 14 months as interior minister, Salvini curbed migrant arrivals and hampered the activities of rescue ships, threatening the charities operating them with fines and trying to force other European states to take the migrants in.
""They are trying to stop me and frighten you: I promise you that I will not give up and I will never give up!,"" Salvini said after the court's request on Tuesday.
In an almost identical case due to come before parliament this month, the senate is expected to authorize magistrates in the Sicilian city of Catania to put Salvini on trial on another migrant kidnapping charge.
His far-right movement is also facing two separate financial probes for possible money laundering and for international corruption over suspicions that it tried to obtain millions of euros via a secret Russian oil deal.
The League remains easily Italy's largest party with more than 30% of votes, latest polls say, but a defeat in a key regional election last January frustrated Salvini's latest effort to bring down the government and return to power."

BERLIN (Reuters) - A German court on Tuesday ruled a 700-year-old anti-Semitic sculpture could stay on the exterior of a church in the city of Wittenberg, dismissing a claim by a member of the local Jewish community that it was defamatory and should be removed.
The court case comes amid a national debate in Germany about rising anti-Jewish hate, after an anti-Semitic gunman killed two people near a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle last year.
The ""Judensau,"" or ""Jew pig"", on a wall of Wittenberg's St Mary's church is a reminder of widespread anti-Semitism in the Middle Ages. It depicts a rabbi lifting the tail of a sow and peeping at its behind, while Jewish children suckle on the animal.
Pigs are considered unclean in Judaism, which forbids both their rearing as well as pork consumption.
The Higher Regional Court in Naumburg ruled that displaying the ""Judensau"", which is 4 meters from the ground did not constitute an offence.
""The sculpture in its current context has neither an insulting character, nor does it violate the plaintiff's personal rights,"" the judgment said.
Sigmount A. Koenigsberg of Berlin's Jewish community said: ""We don't want this 'Judensau' to disappear. It should be on public display but not on the side of a church. It belongs in a museum alongside clear historical context about anti-Semitism in the Middle Ages.""
St. Mary's Church said in a statement, that it acknowledged with sadness, that there were those who would feel hurt and offended by the sculpture. But it added that in 1988, in consultation with the Jewish community, it had created a site of remembrance incorporating the ""Judensau"", a plaque on the ground beneath remembering the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust, and an information board.
The court said the information board clearly stated that the parish ""distanced itself from the persecution of Jews, the anti-Judaic writings of Martin Luther and the mocking aim of the defamatory sculpture"".
It was the second time in two years that a court has ruled against the removal of Wittenberg's ""Judensau"", one of about two dozen such sculptures from the Middle Ages that still feature on churches in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.
The German government is trying to tame an alarming rise in anti-Semitism with stricter laws against hate speech online, tougher gun ownership rules and increased campaigns to raise awareness."

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - A Hungarian teachers' union on Tuesday protested against a new school curriculum it says is designed by the ruling Fidesz party to promote its nationalist agenda and curb academic freedoms.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the leader of Fidesz, has often come under fire from the European Union and human rights groups for a range of policies they say harm democracy and the rule of law in Hungary.
In the education field, Orban has restricted the freedom of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and forced the Central European University to leave the country.
The Ministry of Human Resources announced the National Fundamental Curriculum (NAT) on Friday, specifying in detail the required material for study in elementary and secondary schools.
The Democratic Union of Teachers (PDSZ) called for protests against the changes, now cast in law.
""It is problematic when an educational framework is based on ideology rather than professional principles,"" PDSZ said in a statement on its website. ""It should be withdrawn.""
Teachers of history and literature issued separate statements complaining that the NAT favors nationalist authors and agendas.
For instance, the NAT names among what it considers the 10 most important Hungarian authors Ferenc Herczeg, who was an ardent supporter of Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.
It contains no mention of Hungary's only Nobel-winning author, Imre Kertesz, who was honored in 2002 for his body of work on the human experience during the Holocaust.
""This curriculum expects a constant declaration of moral, ideological views,"" wrote Gyorgy Fenyo, deputy director of the Association of Literature Teachers. ""It leaves no freedom for thought but dictates what (we are meant to) think.""
""It... can only serve as a curriculum of a dictatorship,"" he added.
Asked about the union's criticism, a government spokesman said: ""Hungary's best experts prepared NAT after lengthy professional discussions.""
The human resources minister said on Monday Hungary had needed to update its school curriculum.
""Future generations can begin their lives leaning on a curriculum based on values and showing European, Hungarian values,"" Miklos Kasler told state television.
Teachers protesting began to post photos on social media with the #noNAT hashtag and slogans such as ""I will not teach fascism""."

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Wachira Waheire was 25 years old when he was thrown into Kenya's notorious torture cells for possessing a poster saying hunger will lead to revolution. 
Decades later, the human rights activist sought a meeting with the man he held responsible. It never happened. On Tuesday, former president Daniel Arap Moi died and with him Waheire's hopes for a reckoning.
""If he looked at the victims eyeball to eyeball ... we were willing to forgive him,"" Waheire told Reuters. 
""He declined to face us.... if someone is not willing to own up, I think you cannot go ahead and forgive.""
Hours after the 95-year-old former president passed away, coverage of his divisive legacy began to split along familiar lines. 
Supporters praised him for keeping Kenya stable when neighbors crumbled into civil war, and for peacefully leaving power in 2002 after 24 years as head of state - a rare occurrence in Africa at that time.
Others criticized him for the corruption that spread under his watch and recalled how his government set up torture chambers in the basement of Nyayo House, a government building in central Nairobi that now houses the immigration department.
Thousands of activists, students and academics were held without charge in the underground cells, some of them filled with water. Prisoners said they were sometimes denied food and water.
Moi never addressed the rampant human rights abuses under his rule and also refused to engage with the nation's Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, established in 2008. 
That's the body Waheire represented when he sought in vain to meet with Moi in 2011. 
Moi's spokesman Lee Njiru did not return messages seeking comment. 
Kenya has never confronted its history, Waheire said - there's no mention of the Nyayo House or Nyati House torture cells in the curriculum, or the 1984 Wagalla massacre, when the military killed hundreds of men and boys, mostly ethnic Somalis in a purported disarmament operation.
After stepping down Moi lived quietly for years on his sprawling estate in the Rift Valley, playing the role of a respected elder statesman.
Government promises to turn Nyayo House into a museum have not been honored. 
Waheire said he'd toured national monuments to victims of repression in South Africa, Argentina and Germany and had been especially moved by the plaques with people's names. Kenya needs that, he said. 
""Young people are completely ignorant of that history. The egregious human rights of Moi's time are completely sugar-coated,"" he said.
The older generation have not forgotten. Paul Amina, now 74, was a young courts reporter covering the case of Mbaraka Karanja, a suspect who disappeared in police custody, when he was arrested in 1987.
He was beaten, stripped naked for interrogations and held in solitary confinement before being detained for six months without trial. 
""Justice has never been done,"" Amina said. ""It was the saddest moment of this country that such things happened in an independent country.""
Mugo Theuri, co-editor of ""We Lived to Tell"", a collection of tales from survivors of the Nyayo House torture cells, was jailed for three years in 1986 after being held for 49 days in a cell full of water. 
""There was a lot of beating and then after seven days, you were taken to the interrogators,"" Theuri told Reuters.
By never addressing his victims, Moi missed the chance for reconciliation, he said. 

""Obviously I have no tears for him. He was given an opportunity to come out and speak honestly,"" Theuri said. ""He never appeared.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Travel restrictions related to the novel coronavirus from China could impact city and state economies across the United States, which have benefited from a huge jump in tourism from China in recent years, analysts say.
Riverside, California, known for its citrus groves, mountain scenery and art galleries, and Buffalo, New York, the closest big town to the vast Niagara Falls, would be among the hardest hit in a list of places from big cities to tourist towns particularly popular with Chinese visitors.
Major U.S. airlines have suspended flights from China, and the Trump administration is barring foreign visitors who have been to mainland China over the past 14 days.
A fall-off in visits from China represents the ""most immediate and direct link between the U.S. economy"" and the virus, said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. He projects real GDP growth at 1.7% this year, just below the U.S. economy’s 2% potential growth rate.
Visits from China to the United States have increased 1,270% since the SARS virus outbreak in 2002, to 2.8 million in 2019, according to Tourism Economics, part of research firm Oxford Economics.
The figure includes students and tourists both. About 15% of visitors from China indicate “education” as the purpose of their visit in the Department of Commerce Survey of International Air Travelers (NYSE:TRV), Oxford Economics said.
The virus will result in a $10.3 billion loss in Chinese visitor spending in the United States, most of that in 2020, Oxford Economics estimates.
Each visitor spends an average of $6,000 per trip, not including airfare or money spent on education, the research firm says.
The impact of those losses won't be spread evenly around the country. Visitors from China tend to flock to big United States cities like Los Angeles and New York City, Tourism Economics found:

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will ban the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars from 2035, five years earlier than planned, in an attempt to reduce air pollution that could herald the end of over a century of reliance on the internal combustion engine.
The step amounts to a victory for electric cars that if copied globally could hit the wealth of oil producers, as well as transform the car industry and one of the icons of 20th Century capitalism: the automobile itself.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking to use the announcement to elevate the United Kingdom's environmental credentials after he sacked the head of a Glasgow U.N. Climate Change Conference planned for November known as COP26.
""We have to deal with our CO2 emissions,"" Johnson said at a launch event for COP26 at London's Science Museum on Tuesday. ""As a country and as a society, as a planet, as a species, we must now act.""
The government said that, subject to consultation, it would end the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars and vans in 2035, or earlier if a faster transition was possible.
Countries and cities around the world have announced plans to crack down on diesel vehicles following the 2015 Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) emissions scandal and the EU is introducing tougher carbon dioxide rules. 
The mayors of Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centres by 2025. France is preparing to ban the sale of fossil fuel-powered cars by 2040.
While demand for electric vehicles has surged in Britain, Europe's second-largest market for new vehicles, diesel and petrol models still account for 90% of sales. Prospective buyers of greener models are worried about the limited availability of charging points, the range of certain models and the cost.
The government said last year it was providing an extra 2.5 million pounds ($3.25 million) to fund the installation of more than 1,000 new charge points for electric vehicles on residential streets.
ELECTRIC DREAM?
While some automakers may find it hard to countenance the end of the combustion engine, others have embraced a future in which electric vehicles prevail.
Ford (N:F), Volkswagen and Vauxhall are Britain's biggest-selling car manufacturers, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Tesla (O:TSLA), Mitsubishi (T:7211) and BMW (DE:BMWG) produce the top three selling electric cars in Britain.
Although the ban will not come into force for another 15 years, the change will affect decision-making sooner as carmakers decide on investments long before a vehicle first rolls off a production line with a model life cycle lasting around seven years.
The ban poses a threat to German jobs as Britain is the biggest export market for its car manufacturers, amounting to about 20% of global sales, and electric cars take less time to build than combustion-engined or hybrid variants. 
POWER SOURCE
The two-week COP26 summit is seen as a moment of truth for the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming. Britain has pledged to reach net zero by 2050.
Johnson also signalled that a phase-out of Britain's coal-fired power plants would be brought forward by a year to 2024. Coal provides just 3% of the country’s electricity, down from 70% three decades ago, he said.
Johnson's launch of COP26 was marred by a stinging attack on the prime minister by the summit's former head Clare O'Neill who was sacked from the post last week.
Johnson declined to answer any questions on O'Neill, but last week the government said the role would be filled by a minister with her replacement expected to be announced this month.

The company said it expects the cancellations to trim its first-quarter earnings by 25 cents per share, but added that there are too many uncertainties to give a good estimate of the impact.
""It seems likely that we will have to cancel more, but we don't yet know how many,"" Chief Executive Officer Richard Fain said on the post-earnings conference call.
Royal Caribbean also said it would deny boarding to people who had visited mainland China or Hong Kong over the past 15 days. It will also screen Chinese and Hong Kong passport holders and people showing flu-like symptoms, including its own staff.
The company had expected China to account for 6% of its overall capacity in 2020 and 4% of the total capacity in the first quarter, Fain said.
Royal Caribbean, the second-biggest cruise operator by market valuation, currently has one ship, Spectrum of the Seas, whose port of origin is Shanghai in China, with two more cruise liners expected to join in May and July.
The company had earlier canceled three trips scheduled for February, after consultation with health authorities over the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 400 people and infected thousands in China.
The Miami, Florida-based company forecast 2020 adjusted profit to be between $10.40 and $10.70 per share, excluding any potential impact from the outbreak, largely above Wall Street expectations of $10.47, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Shares of the cruise operator, which has set a target of hitting $20 per share in adjusted earnings by 2025, were up about 4% in morning trade."

Tebboune, elected in December in a vote opposed by a huge protest movement seeking the replacement of the entire ruling elite, has said his top priority is to restore confidence.
Thousands of people are still protesting every Friday, but the numbers appear to have waned since Tebboune's election and his offer of talks with the opposition.
Last month he also ordered the release of dozens of people who had been detained for taking part in the protests.
He has also promised a process to offer constitutional amendments to the public through a referendum in order to give parliament a bigger role and increase political freedoms.
A court in Algiers on Monday acquitted Samir Benlarbi, an activist and a leading member of the protest movement who had been detained for over four months for ""harming the national unity"".
Several other activists are still in detention pending trail in Algiers and other towns, but it was unclear whether the 3,471 people pardoned on Tuesday include those detained for involvement in the recent political unrest."
1516,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 10:48AM ET</span>","EU rejects Trump Middle East peace plan, annexation","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union rejected parts of U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan for the Middle East on Tuesday, prompting an angry response from Israel which has strongly backed the U.S. proposal.
The plan, announced by Trump last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his side, was rejected outright by the Palestinians. It would give Israel most of what it has sought during decades of conflict, including nearly all Palestinian land on which it has built settlements.
The EU, which often takes time to respond to international developments because of a need for unanimity among its 27 members, had said last week that it needed to study the Trump plan before it would give its verdict.
It made its conclusions public on Tuesday in a statement from EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who said Trump's plan departs from ""internationally agreed parameters"".
""To build a just and lasting peace, the unresolved final status issues must be decided through direct negotiations between both parties,"" Borrell said, noting the issues of the borders of a Palestinian state and the final status of Jerusalem were among those still in dispute.
Steps by Israel to annex Palestinian territory, ""if implemented, could not pass unchallenged,"" Borrell said.
Israel responded sharply to the remarks by Borrell, a Spaniard in office since the start of December.
""The fact that the High Rep of the EU, Josep Borrell, chose to use threatening language towards Israel, so shortly after he assumed office & only hours after his meetings in Iran, is regrettable &, to say the least, odd,"" tweeted Israeli Foreign ministry Spokesman Lior Haiat. 
""Pursuing such policies & conduct is the best way to ensure that the EU's role in any process will be minimized.""
EU policy in the Middle East tends to be cautious, as the bloc includes members with varying degrees of sympathy towards the Palestinians and Israel. Some EU members have already recognized a Palestinian state, although the bloc as a whole says this is a matter to be resolved in peace talks.

The EU condemned Trump's decision in 2017 to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying Washington had compromised its position as a mediator for peace.

Canadians in Wuhan, capital of China's Hubei province, have received an email from the foreign ministry saying a plane was expected to leave with evacuees early on Feb. 6, according to a report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC).
However, a Canadian government source said the Chinese government had yet to give final consent for the flight. Residents of Wuhan and Hubei have been under quarantine for a few weeks as China attempts to contain the spread of the virus.
According to a portion of the letter the CBC posted online, not everyone who is eligible for a seat will get one.
""Right now, there is a larger number of Canadians asking for evacuation than is space on the plane,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on his way to a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. ""That's why we have already got an option on the second plane.""
Trudeau said the aim was to get people home soon, specifying the time frame only as ""in coming days.""
On Monday, Canada's foreign minister said some 300 people had asked to be evacuated. They will be flown first to Vancouver, where the plane will refuel, and then on to a military base in southern Ontario.
Those evacuated will be placed in quarantine for 14 days once they arrive at Trenton Air Force base, some 180 km (110 miles) northeast of Toronto.
Hong Kong reported its first coronavirus death on Tuesday, the second outside mainland China after the Philippines, from a fast-spreading outbreak that has killed 427 people and threatened the global economy.

The migrants chanted ""Freedom"" and some held up a banner saying: ""Our children are still alive"".
Riot police dispersed them without resorting to tough tactics, a Reuters witness said.
On Monday, police had fired teargas at protesters who marched from the congested migrant camps to the city of Mytilene. About 40 people were arrested.
Earlier on Tuesday, Lesbos residents rallied outside a government building to protest against having the camps on the island. A banner read ""Lesbos is Greek land"".
Greece served as the gateway to the European Union for more than one million Syrian refugees and other migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond in 2015-2016.
The Aegean Islands, which are close to Turkey, have been struggling with a resurgence in refugee and migrant flows.
Lesbos' main camp in Moria hosts more than five times its capacity. Aid groups have described living conditions in the camp as appalling.
A police official told Reuters more guards and riot police would be deployed on the island.
Government spokesman Stelios Petsas said on Tuesday the protests underscored the state's duty to protect its citizens and the need to implement new policies.
Greece has adopted a tougher stance on migration since the conservative government led by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis came to power in July. The government wants to set up detentions centers and deport those whose asylum requests are being rejected.

LAGOS (Reuters) - The United States and the British dependency of Jersey have agreed with Nigeria to repatriate more than $300 million in funds stolen by former military ruler General Sani Abacha, the three governments said.
Abacha ruled Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer, from 1993 until his death in 1998. Corruption watchdog Transparency International estimates he stole as much as $5 billion of public money during that time.
He was never charged with corruption during his life and Nigeria has been fighting for years to recover the money.
Companies linked to the Abacha family have gone to court to prevent repatriation, alleging infringement of their rights to a fair trial.
The governments of Nigeria, Jersey and the United States said in a statement they had entered into an asset recovery agreement to repatriate forfeited assets to Nigeria.
The Nigerian government pegged the total amount at $321 million.
The funds were laundered through the U.S. banking system and then held in bank accounts in Jersey in the name of Doraville Properties Corporation, a British Virgin Islands company, and in the name of the son of the ex-military ruler, they said.
""This agreement has culminated in a major victory for Nigeria and other African countries as it recognizes that crime does not pay and that it is important for the international community to seek for ways to support sustainable development through the recovery and repatriation of stolen assets,"" Nigerian Attorney General Abubakar Malami said.
Nigeria has been working with governments around the world in recent years on an asset recovery scheme to help repatriate its stolen funds to boost its finances.
The government did not state how much in total it believes Abacha stole. As at 2013, Nigeria had recovered about $1.3 billion of Abacha's money from various European jurisdictions, with more than a third of that from Switzerland.
The Swiss government in 2017 said it would return to Nigeria about $321 million in assets seized from Abacha's family via a deal signed with the World Bank.
Abacha's laundering operation extended to the United States and European jurisdictions such as Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Lichtenstein and Luxembourg, the statement said.
His family, which has never admitted nor denied that funds were stolen, could not be reached for comment and their present whereabouts were not known.
In a separate news release, the U.S. Department of Justice said it is seeking to enforce forfeiture judgments for approximately $30 million in assets located in Britain and more than $144 million in France.
In 2014 a U.S. court forfeited the money as property involved in the illicit laundering of the proceeds of corruption arising in Nigeria during the five years when Abacha was head of state. Negotiations for repatriation commenced in 2018.
The funds would be administered by Nigeria's sovereign wealth fund and would be used to develop road infrastructure, that will boost supply chain connections and economic growth, Malami said."

1521,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 09:19AM ET</span>",French port town dreams of becoming post-Brexit duty-free haven,"By Richard Lough
CALAIS, France (Reuters) - Authorities in Calais are lobbying the French government to create a duty-free zone for British shoppers that would cover the entire port town in northern France if a future trade deal between Britain and the EU heralds a return of trade tariffs.
Mayor Natacha Bouchart anticipates Britain's planned exit from the EU's single market will revive the cross-Channel 'booze cruises' that saw Britons in the 1980s and 1990s day-trip to Calais to buy cheap cigarettes, beer and wine on board ferries.
""Our mayor is fighting for the whole town of Calais to benefit from the same duty-free rules as the ferries,"" said Philippe Mignonet, one of Bouchart's deputies.
The fortunes of Calais rely on the smooth flow of people and goods across the English Channel. The mayor's initiative reflects the growing doubts in the town over whether a future trade deal will maintain the single market's zero-tariff, friction-free movement of goods across the Britain-EU border.
Calais authorities were also exploring the option of tax rebates that would allow visiting Britons to reclaim VAT on hotel stays and restaurant meals, Mignonet said, a move aimed at encouraging them to spend more time and money in the town.
EU rules allow private individuals to carry unlimited amounts of alcohol and cigarettes across the bloc's internal borders provided they are not for resale.
But after Britain ended its 47-year membership of the EU on Friday, it now has until Dec. 31, 2020, to negotiate a trade accord that will determine what tariffs, if any, Britain and the EU levy on each other's goods, and caps to duty-free commerce.
CHOCOLATES, ELECTRONICS
Mignonet said junior budget minister Gerald Darmanin had so far pushed back against the proposed city-wide duty exemptions for alcohol and tobacco in the town center because of smuggling concerns.
""I don't think they'll budge on those,"" he said, but added it could be applied to goods such as chocolate, perfumes and electronic goods.
Darmanin's office was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday.
The looming trade talks between London and Brussels will be closely watched by the owners of the cavernous wine stores dotted along the highway leading out of Calais, where signs are in English and prices quoted in sterling.
""The worst case scenario? That would be to limit the huge volumes that British clients can take back with them to England,"" said Oliver Versmisse, owner of the Oliver, Vin et Compagnie store that overlooks the Eurotunnel terminal.
Several million Britons used to make day trips across the Channel every year during the heyday of the booze cruise, local officials say, before duty-free shopping ended in 1999 following the creation of the EU's single market.
Its renaissance on board vessels and in the ferry terminal would be ""very good for the port"", said Calais port director Jean-Marc Puissesseau, who is overseeing a 700 million euro expansion that will double the port's capacity from early 2021."
1522,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",Taliban accuses U.S. of delaying peace process after call for violence reduction,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's Taliban on Tuesday accused the United States of hampering peace negotiations in response to the top American diplomat's comments that a reduction in violence was needed before a deal to end years of war could be struck.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday said during a visit to Uzbekistan that ""demonstrable evidence"" of a reduction in Taliban violence was necessary for a peace agreement with the Islamist group.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said issues from the American end, including a tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump halting the signing of an agreement last year, were the reason for challenges in the peace process.
""Mr. Pompeo should not shift the blame. Our stance is principled and united, and our policy is not shaky like the opposite side,"" said Mujahid in a statement on messaging service Whatsapp.
Trump abruptly called off the talks to end the 18-year war in a Tweet in September after a U.S. soldier was killed in an attack by the militant group.
Talks have since resumed but have suffered setbacks due to multiple attacks, including a December suicide bombing of a U.S. base outside Kabul that killed two civilians.
Hostilities have surged in recent weeks, suggesting a deadlock in the peace talks between U.S. and Taliban negotiators in Qatar's capital, Doha.
At least 29 members of the Afghan security forces were killed in Taliban attacks that followed air and ground assaults by government forces on the Islamist group in January.
Afghan forces and the Taliban also clashed last week when security personnel tried to access the site of a crashed U.S. military plane in central Afghanistan. U.S. forces were later able to get to the site and recover the remains of two personnel and what is believed to be the flight data recorder.
Trump was reported last year to be planning to withdraw around half of the 14,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan, adding pressure to secure a peace agreement with the Taliban to prevent the country from collapsing.
The Taliban have made increasing gains as moves towards a possible peace deal have continued, with expanding control over large parts of the war-torn country."

In another case, two people working for a charity were sentenced to 10 years in prison for spying and five years in prison for acting against national security on similar charges, judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said, according to Fars.
""Amir Rahimpour who was a CIA spy and got big pay and tried to present part of Iran's nuclear information to the American service had been tried and sentenced to death and recently the supreme court upheld his sentence and he will see the consequences of his action soon,"" Esmaili said, referring to the individual facing capital punishment.
Esmaili did not provide any additional information about the nationality of the convicted individuals working for a charity. Iran does not recognize dual nationality and the judiciary prosecutes dual nationals as Iranian citizens.
Last summer, Iran announced it had broken up a CIA spy ring of 17 individuals and that some had been sentenced to death.
The CIA did not immediately comment on Esmaili's remarks. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted after the announcement last summer: ""The Report of Iran capturing CIA spies is totally false. Zero truth.""
Tensions have increased between Tehran and Washington since the United States killed top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3, prompting the Islamic Republic to retaliate with a missile strike against a U.S. base in Iraq.
Speaking at a press conference streamed live on the judiciary's website, Esmaili said the names of the individuals working for a charity would not be released yet because the sentence has not been finalised."

Sudan's cabinet on Tuesday discussed that meeting, which it said it had not yet been informed about. It also summoned leaders of the Forces for Freedom and Change, an alliance that fronted protests that toppled Omar al-Bashir last year, for consultations, FFC sources said.
Bilateral relations have never been normalized, and doing so would likely raise hackles in Sudan and the wider Arab world, especially at a time when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is promoting a new U.S. peace plan rejected by Palestinians.
But Sudan is also anxious to rebuild link with the outside world after decades of isolation under Islamist Bashir, and to be removed from a U.S. list of countries considered state sponsors of terrorism.
Israeli officials said on Monday that Netanyahu had met Sudan sovereign council head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan for two hours in Uganda.
Sudan's government spokesman said officials were waiting for ""clarifications"" on Burhan's return.
Burhan is the most senior figure in the first phase of a power-sharing arrangement between the military and civilian parties that began last August, following Bashir's overthrow.
The U.S. listing has impeded badly needed international financial assistance and commercial activity in Sudan.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo thanked Burhan by phone ""for his leadership in normalizing ties with Israel,"" his spokesperson said on Monday, and Washington has invited Burhan to visit later this year.
Yoav Gallant, an Israeli security cabinet member from Netanyahu's Likud party, said in a Twitter post after the PM's meeting with Burhan: ""Country after country... want to draw close to Israel and improve ties. Israeli power is the key to success - not grovelling."""
1525,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>",Factbox: Key hurdles blocking way to post-Brexit deal,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - London and Brussels are already sparring over the terms of their future relationship, just days after Britain's historic departure from the European Union.
Britain will continue to obey the EU's laws during a transition period until the end of December.
Given taking back control was a key part of the pro-Brexit campaign, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ruled out any extension of that period, but the EU says that leaves too little time to seal more than a ""bare bones"" trade deal.
Negotiations will not start until March and they will need to reach an agreement by mid-October to leave time needed to translate it from English into the EU's other 22 official languages and secure parliamentary approval.
Otherwise, a ""cliff edge"" scenario would leave trade between Britain and the EU based from 2021 on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms that would lead to import duties and controls.
ZERO DUMPING
Both sides want a ""zero tariffs, zero quotas"" deal, but the EU says it requires a guarantee of ""zero dumping"".
Brussels says Britain would have to align with the EU on state aid, environment, tax, labor and social policies to protect EU consumers and shield EU businesses from unfair competition.
Britain insists it will diverge but its standards will not necessarily be weaker: for example, it says it has resorted to state aid far less than some EU states.
Britain has said it would be open to a trade deal similar to the agreement the EU has with Canada. The EU-Canada deal will remove 99% of tariffs and limited quotas, but Ottawa has not had to align its rules with the EU.
Brussels counters that Britain's geographical proximity and UK-EU economic interdependence make alignment necessary to protect EU consumers and businesses.
Johnson has suggested an alternative Australia-style arrangement. But most EU-Australia trade runs along basic WTO rules, so this would effectively be a no deal. Australia itself also wants a trade deal with the EU.
FISH & FINANCE
One of the biggest challenges will be fishing rights.
Regaining control of Britain's rich fishing waters was a totemic issue for many Brexit campaigners.
The EU has some leverage.
Many British fishing communities rely heavily on selling to EU markets, particularly for shellfish.
The EU also insists a fish deal must be an integral part of an EU-UK trade deal. This is an extension of its overall stance that the negotiations cannot be broken into smaller parts on which it might be easier for Britain to win concessions.
Accordingly, Brussels has linked - though not explicitly - the fish spat to access to EU markets for Britain's giant financial sector.
THE EU COURT OF JUSTICE
The EU wants a partnership with arrangements for dispute settlement, including a role for the Court of Justice of the European Union to make binding rulings.
The British government has rejected this because, it says, the EU court would not be a neutral arbiter.
IRISH BORDER
Under the withdrawal agreement reached in October, Northern Ireland will leave the EU's customs union but remain aligned with single market rules for trade in animals, animal products, food and manufactured goods.
This arrangement maintains the frictionless border between EU member state Ireland and the UK province of Northern Ireland that was a key part of the 1998 agreement to end 30 years of violence.
However, it will require customs and regulatory checks at ports to ensure that goods coming from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland conform to EU standards.
Johnson has said there would only be such checks if Britain fails to secure a zero tariff-zero quota deal with the EU, which officials in Brussels say is untrue.
GIBRALTAR
Johnson said on Monday that London will be negotiating on behalf of the UK family, which includes Gibraltar, a rocky British enclave on Spain's southern tip.
However, the EU's position is that it will not be included in the negotiations, and any separate agreements on Gibraltar - over which Spain has territorial claims - would require approval from Madrid."

LONDON (Reuters) - The brother of the bomber who carried out a suicide attack on an Ariana Grande concert in the English city of Manchester three years ago was just as guilty of murdering the 22 victims as his sibling, prosecutors told London's Old Bailey court on Tuesday.
Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton born to Libyan parents, blew himself up at Manchester Arena at the close of a show by the Grammy-winning U.S. pop singer. Among the dead were seven children, the youngest aged just eight. More than 500 people were injured.
On Tuesday, his brother Hashem Abedi, 22, went on trial accused of helping his brother to carry out the bombing. He denies any involvement in the attack, including charges of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion.
""Hashem Abedi is just as responsible for this atrocity and for the offences which are identified in the indictment ... just as surely as if he had selected the target and detonated the bomb himself,"" prosecutor Duncan Penny said.
Penny said Hashem Abedi helped his brother to get the ingredients for making the homemade bomb and together they experimented with its construction, buying items such as screws and nails to be used as shrapnel.
They stored and made the device at a separate address in Manchester and, shortly before they returned to Libya in mid-April 2017, they bought a car to be used to store the bomb-making equipment.
""This explosion was the culmination of months of planning, experimentation and preparation by the two of them,"" Penny said. ""The bomb which was detonated was self-evidently designed to kill and to maim as many people as possible.""
Hashem Abedi was extradited to Britain from Libya in July last year after the Libyan authorities agreed to hand him over.
Islamic State said it was responsible for the attack in the immediate aftermath of the bombing, but security services have always treated that claim with scepticism.
In 2018, British lawmakers concluded that the MI5 security service had missed potential opportunities to prevent the bombing.
The Abedi family emigrated to Britain during the rule of late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, moving from London to the Fallowfield area of south Manchester. The brothers’ parents returned to Libya after Gaddafi was toppled in 2011."

GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. envoy to Libya said on Tuesday there was a ""genuine will to start negotiating"" between rival military factions as they planned to meet for the first time for talks in Geneva aimed at securing a lasting ceasefire.
However, Ghassan Salame told reporters that an arms embargo was being violated by both sides and that new mercenaries and arms were still arriving ""by air and by sea"" in Libya, where forces loyal to eastern based commander Khalifa Haftar have been trying to take the capital, Tripoli, for the past 10 months.
The talks bring together five senior military officers from Haftar's Libyan National Army and five from forces aligned with the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli.
Fighting has continued on the ground despite a call for a truce by Russia and Turkey starting on Jan. 12 and an international summit on Libya in Berlin on Jan. 19 aimed at reducing international interference.
Haftar has had material support from countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, and Russia, U.N. experts and diplomats say, while the GNA is backed militarily by Turkey. 
Salame deplored the presence of more than ""20 million pieces of weaponry"" in the country and said that he had asked the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution to reaffirm an existing arms embargo and pass measures to ensure it is respected.
Talks between the two sides, who did not meet face-to-face in Geneva on Monday, were aiming ""to bridge the gaps in their views on how the lasting, sustainable ceasefire can be organized on the ground,"" Salame said.
""We started yesterday to discuss with them a long list of points on our agenda, starting on an attempt to transform the truce into a more solid one, less often violated by either side and also to transform that truce into a real agreement on a lasting ceasefire,"" he said.
Haftar's offensive, which upended a previous U.N. peace plan, deepened the gulf between loose alliances that have competed for power from western and eastern Libya since 2014.
The GNA was set up in 2016 from a previous U.N. peace push that Haftar and his backers spurned.
The conflict that developed in Libya in the years since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011 has given space to militants and migrant smugglers and crippled Libya's oil reliant economy.
A blockade of oil ports and fields by groups loyal to Haftar that began just before the Berlin conference has reduced oil output by about one million barrels per day (bpd).

Asked if he would press Haftar to end the blockade, Salame said it was mainly an issue being pursued on the ground, urging foreign powers to back a broader U.N. bid to resume production.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya's longest-serving president Daniel Arap Moi, whose rule was marred by corruption and torture of opponents, died on Tuesday, the office of the president said.
He was 95.
There was no immediate explanation for Moi's death, but he had been in and out of hospital with breathing problems in recent months.
Plaudits poured in from Kenyan politicians, but some of his victims were less forgiving. 
""Our nation and our continent were immensely blessed by the dedication and service of the late ... Moi, who spent almost his entire adult life serving Kenya and Africa,"" President Uhuru Kenyatta said in a statement. 
Moi died peacefully in hospital at 5.20 a.m. (0220 GMT), surrounded by his family, said his son Gideon Moi, a senator.
Moi came to power in 1978, when he was serving as vice-president and the nation's first leader President Jomo Kenyatta died. He remained in power until the end of 2002 when his constitutional term ran out.
Uhuru Kenyatta, the son of Jomo Kenyatta, was Moi's preferred successor but lost the election to the opposition. Uhuru Kenyatta became president in 2013.
Moi is credited for keeping Kenya relatively stable compared with its troubled neighbors, and he worked for peace in the region.
But he oversaw massive corruption scandals that are still costing Kenyan taxpayers. One scandal, Goldenberg, led to the loss of at least $1 billion in central bank money via compensation payments for bogus gold and diamond exports.
The economy stagnated under Moi, leaving millions mired in poverty.
Diplomats said an attempted coup in 1982 transformed Moi from a cautious, insecure leader into a tough autocrat. 
Moi rewrote the constitution to legalize de facto one-party rule, which secured power for his Kenya African National Union (KANU) until 1991, when Moi caved in to international pressure to reintroduce multi-party politics.
""I STILL CARRY SCARS""
His government set up interrogation chambers in the basement of Nyayo House, a government building in central Nairobi that now houses the immigration department.
Thousands of activists, students and academics were held without charge in the underground cells, some of them partly filled with water.
Prisoners say they were sometimes denied food and water and beaten to confess fictitious crimes or just for revenge. 
""There remains the legacy of disappearances and unexplained deaths, detention without trial, repression of freedom of expression and the media,"" said human rights lawyer Gitobu Imanyara, who was held in solitary confinement for two years.
""I never knew if I was going to make it out alive - I still carry scars. Some people were not as lucky as I am. They died. These are the people we need to remember.""

Moi barely survived demands for his resignation over the 1990 murder of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko, an important Luo leader. In 2010, a government inquiry into the death, presented to parliament five years after it was written, said the murder was carried out in one of Moi's official residences.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will visit Venezuela on Friday in a show of support for President Nicolas Maduro, a socialist who Washington wants out of power.
Russia has helped Maduro weather a political crisis as the United States has targeted Caracas with sanctions and, like dozens of other countries, recognizes opposition politician Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate interim leader.
Moscow has denounced the U.S. sanctions as illegal and damaging, while Venezuela's opposition has urged Washington to step up pressure on Russia for its economic, diplomatic and military support of Maduro.
Lavrov, foreign minister since 2004, flies to Latin America on Wednesday, stopping in Cuba before heading to Mexico on Thursday and Venezuela the next day.
His trip follows a tour by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of four former Soviet states - Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan - in a region that Moscow sees as its backyard.
In Venezuela, Lavrov will meet Maduro as well as Executive Vice President Delcy Rodriguez and Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza for talks that will broach deeper cooperation on energy, mining, transport, agriculture and defense, Russia's foreign ministry said.
""The agenda includes a discussion of steps ... to counteract illegal unilateral sanctions that worsen the socioeconomic situation in Venezuela,"" ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
The United States last year ratcheted up diplomatic pressure on Venezuela and imposed sanctions on the OPEC member's state oil company, PDVSA.
Venezuela's opposition disputed the legitimacy of Maduro's re-election to a second term in 2018, and opposition leader Guaido proclaimed himself interim president in January last year, winning the backing of Washington and other countries.
Maduro has remained in power though, backed by the military as well as Russia, China and Cuba
In Mexico, Lavrov will meet Foreign Secretary Luis Ebrard Casaubon to discuss economic and trade ties as well as cooperation with the Community of Latin America and Caribbean States (CELAC). In Cuba, Lavrov will meet his counterpart, Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, Zakharova said."

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African court issued an arrest warrant for former president Jacob Zuma on Tuesday, after he skipped court on grounds of needing medical treatment, but the judge stayed the warrant until his corruption trial resumes on May 6.
Zuma's lawyer presented the judge with a sick note from what he said was a military hospital, but Judge Dhaya Pillay questioned whether the note was valid, as there was no medical number showing if and where the doctor was certified.
""I don't even know if (he) ... is a doctor. There is ... nothing to suggest that he is,"" she said, before issuing the warrant.
The former leader is on trial on 18 charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a $2 billion arms deal with French defense firm Thales in 1999, when Zuma was deputy president. He rejects the allegations as a politically motivated witch-hunt. 
Dan Mantsha, Zuma's lawyer, said that he was abroad for medical treatment, without saying where. Local media have suggested he is in Cuba, although it was not immediately possible to verify this. 
Pillay concluded that the note was insufficient to excuse Zuma from appearing for the trial, but gave him until it resumes on May 6 to turn up before the warrant kicks in. 
Zuma, president from 2009-2018, had previously applied for a permanent stay of prosecution but the court in Pietermaritzburg threw out his appeal in November.
He is accused of accepting 500,000 rand ($34,000) annually from Thales in 1999, in exchange for protecting the company from an investigation into the deal.
Thales, known as Thompson-CSF at the time, has said it had no knowledge of any transgressions by any of its employees in relation to the award of the contracts.
The National Prosecuting Authority initially filed the charges against Zuma a decade ago, but set them aside shortly before he successfully ran for president in 2009. Following appeals and lobbying by opposition parties, the NPA reinstated the charges in March 2018.

Pillay also accepted an application by the company on Tuesday to be represented by lawyer Barry Roux, who defended Paralympian athlete Oscar Pistorius over the 2013 murder of his girlfriend.

Security Council or triggering new sanctions, the EU's top diplomat said during a visit to Tehran.
Britain, France and Germany formally accused Iran on Jan. 14 of violating the terms of the 2015 arms control agreement aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear program. Violations could lead to the reimposing of U.N. sanctions lifted under the 2015 deal.
""We are in agreement not to go directly to a strict time limit which would oblige (us) to go to the Security Council,"" the EU's Josep Borrell told reporters during a visit to Tehran on Monday.
In his remarks, broadcast on Tuesday, he said: ""The willingness is not to start a process that goes to the end of JCPOA, but to keep it alive,"" referring to the Iran deal by its formal name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
After months of gradual steps to reduce compliance, Iran said on Jan. 6 it would scrap limits on enriching uranium.
Borrell, who is chair of the Iran deal, was notified in January by Paris, London and Berlin that they had triggered the dispute mechanism, in theory starting a 15-day process to resolve issues with Iran.
However, there are some questions over when the 15-day period should start because Iran has not formally recognized the consultation process, officials have said.
China and Russia are also signatories to the deal signed in Vienna in 2015 and have expressed misgivings about the Europeans' decision to trigger the mechanism.
All sides say they want to save the deal, which U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from in May 2018, reimposing economic sanctions on Iran.
Borrell said he had agreed with Berlin, London and Paris to ""continuously postpone"" the 15-day limit. However, he said progress depended on maintaining the presence of the U.N. atomic watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in Iran to monitor its nuclear activities.
After meeting Borrell on Monday, President Hassan Rouhani was quoted as saying that Iran is ready to cooperate with the EU on issues related to the nuclear deal."

The assailant in Monday evening's attack, at a barracks in Dieuze in eastern France, wounded one officer in the hand. Police shot and wounded the knifeman, who is now in hospital.
Shortly before the attack, a call was placed to the police from someone saying he was in the armed forces and was preparing an attack in Dieuze in the name of Islamic State, French media cited local prosecutors as saying.
In October last year, Mickael Harpon, an information technology assistant at police headquarters in central Paris, went on a knife rampage inside the building, killing four people before being shot dead. 
A convert to Islam, Harpon had shown signs of possible radicalization before the attack but no formal investigation was launched and he kept his job.
Monday's attack at the barracks is likely to again raise questions about how France can guard against radicalized people infiltrating its security services. It has a large Muslim community.
""It's been confirmed that the attacker was a young soldier, two months into initial training and currently in his probationary period,"" Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly wrote on Twitter.
""He was not on duty at the time of the incident. It's now for the judicial authorities to investigate the motivation for this attack, which I condemn,"" she wrote.
Paris has suffered major attacks by Islamist militants in recent years.
Coordinated bombings and shootings in November 2015 at the Bataclan theater and other sites around Paris killed 130 people - the deadliest attacks in France since World War Two.
In Britain on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would act to stop the early release of convicted terrorists from jail after an Islamist militant stabbed two people in a street attack in south London.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has received public criticism for his handling of the crisis, led a tribute as legislators returned to parliament for the first time after the long summer break. 
""This is the black summer of 2019/20 that has proven our national character and resolve,"" Morrison said.

Morrison was forced into a rare public apology in December after he went on vacation to Hawaii as the fires escalated. His government's stance on climate change, including its support for the coal industry, has drawn international criticism.
Fires burning since September have destroyed about 12 million hectares (29.7 million acres) across Australia’s most populous states. The blazes have destroyed about 2,500 homes, killed an estimated 1 billion native animals and threatened the habitats of many more.
Authorities said none of the blazes currently burning posed an immediate danger, thanks to cooler weather.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 12:37AM ET</span>","Burdened by sanctions, North Korea sees coronavirus threaten economic lifelines","By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's already tenuous economic lifelines to the outside world are now nearly severed as it seals its borders with China and Russia to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.
Already one of the most closed-off countries in the world, North Korea has stopped airline flights and train service with its neighbors, established weeks-long mandatory quarantines for recently arrived foreigners, suspended international tourism, and imposed a near-complete lockdown on cross-border travel.
The shutdowns could hurt leader Kim Jong Un's efforts to make good on his promise to jumpstart North Korea's economy. Those efforts have been undermined by a lack of progress in denuclearization talks with the United States, which has led the way in imposing international sanctions on North Korea.
""They're keeping the cargo out and they're keeping the Chinese out; nobody can go in or out,"" said one source with firsthand knowledge of the situation at the China-North Korea border.
Kang Mi-jin, a North Korean defector in Seoul who reports for the Daily NK website, also confirmed that the border appears to have been almost entirely shut down since at least Jan. 30.
""The Ministry of People's Armed Forces ordered all guard posts to bar smuggling as well,"" she said. ""People, freight, nothing can come in or go out.""
Pyongyang has reportedly asked Beijing not to repatriate North Korean defectors detained in China, according to one South Korean pastor who works with refugees.
According to the source with knowledge of the situation at the border, North Koreans who work in restaurants and elsewhere in China, violating United Nations sanctions, are in ""virtual captivity"" in their homes under instructions from authorities back in North Korea.
North Korea is typically adept at implementing public health interventions and acted ""swiftly and decisively"" to try to stop the disease from entering the country, but sanctions restrictions could make it difficult for them to get medical supplies, said Harvard Medical School's Kee Park, who has worked on health care projects in North Korea.
""Their actions, very costly in terms of revenue from tourists and trade as well as administratively for quarantining people, reflect their concerns regarding their health system's capacity to handle an outbreak,"" Park said.
CHINA LIFELINE
The efforts - which appear to have been successful in preventing any cases in North Korea so far - mean North Korea has severed or drastically restricted the economic ties it relies on.
""There could be a huge impact not just on the North's market economy, but also on the entire economy of the country,"" Kang said. ""North Korea promotes localization, but even for products – candies, crackers, or clothing – manufactured in the country, the raw materials come from China.""
Upcoming North Korean political holidays, which usually include gifts of sweets and crackers for children, may be more less festive than usual if the country's supplies of sugar, flour, and other ingredients are scarce, she said.
There are already signs that prevention measures could lead to the cancellation of military parades and other mass celebrations at least through February, which includes a commemoration of the North Korean army and former leader Kim Jong Il's birthday.
The extent of the economic risk to North Korea largely depends on the duration of the lockdown and how sweeping the restrictions are, said Artyom Lukin, a professor at Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok.
""If the lockdown continues for several months and longer, this will certainly have a considerable negative impact on North Korea,"" he said.
There are no official numbers on the size of North Korea's economy, but South Korea's Bank of Korea estimated that in 2018 the country's economy shrank for a second straight year, while its international trade fell 48.4 per cent in value.
Since then, China and Russia have more publicly called for sanctions to be lifted, border trade picked up, and there were signs that North Korea's economy may have been on a relative rebound.
A recent report by a South Korean trade association found China's proportion of the North's overall external trade rose to 91.8 percent last year, compared with 17.3 percent in 2001. Thousands of Chinese tourists provided an additional economic lifeline.
The crisis could weaken North Korea's position in its standoff with the United States over denuclearization talks, and could lead Pyongyang to try to offset its greater economic vulnerability by making provocative moves such as resuming long-range missile launches or nuclear tests, Lukin said.
""If the coronavirus situation is not resolved quickly, it is going to make life much more difficult for North Korea in 2020,"" Lukin said."

Olympic construction projects have propped up Japan’s economy through slumping global demand, a destructive super typhoon and a sales tax hike that whacked consumers. Now, just as officials were anticipating a surge in tourism, the coronavirus threatens to keep people away.
While most analysts say the outbreak will be under control before the Olympics begin on July 24, there’s a risk that economic growth in 2020 could be wiped out if it lasts longer than SARS, according to calculations by Bloomberg economist Yuki Masujima.
He now sees the economy taking a 0.5 percentage point hit from the virus impact in his worst-case view. Since economists expect Japan’s gross domestic product to expand 0.5% in 2020, his scenario could result in stalled growth in a year supposed to showcase Japan’s burgeoning status as a must-go destination.

The goal of public health officials is to slow the virus’s entry into the U.S., she said.
Federal and local health authorities have been monitoring people who have displayed symptoms and have a travel history that puts them at risk. The vast majority have tested negative: There are 11 confirmed cases in the U.S., and 167 people who have a negative test. It’s possible that some people can test negative and then have a positive result later, depending on how far along their illness is.
The severity of the U.S. cases has varied, with some people becoming more severely ill, Messonnier said. Some have needed oxygen, she said.

President Jair Bolsonaro said last week that repatriating Brazilians from Wuhan would not be ""opportune"" as it could put the population back home at risk. But he changed his mind over the weekend when Brazilians in Wuhan posted a video appealing to Bolsonaro to get them out.

On Sunday, Bolsonaro said his government will evacuate every Brazilian from Wuhan who wants to return home. He is expected to issue a decree by Tuesday to authorize the quarantine steps and speed up the repatriation of Brazilians.
A ministry spokesman said Brazil is in talks with the Chinese government to obtain authorization for a plane to land in Wuhan, which has been under lockdown since Jan. 23. Airlines around the world have stopped flights to parts of China.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack on Tuesday survived a leadership challenge in a party room vote of the National Party – the junior partner in the coalition government.
McCormack defeated former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, who was forced to resign as Nationals leader in 2018 after having an affair with his then media secretary.
The Nationals leadership challenge comes as Prime Minister Scott Morrison battles to regain voter support following wide spread criticism of his handling of Australia's bushfire crisis.
A Newspoll for The Australian newspaper on Monday showed Morrison's approval rating was at its lowest level since the last election in 2018, while his Liberal-National government is trailing the Labor party by a margin of 52% to 48%.
McCormack's victory is a slight reprieve for Morrison, who would have faced pressure from Joyce to deliver more concessions to rural and regional Australia, said John Hewson, former Liberal party leader.
""It would have been pretty awkward for him to stand next to him if Joyce was elected as his deputy,"" Hewson told Reuters.
Bushfires have killed 33 people, an estimated 1 billion native animals and destroyed land nearly the size of Greece. since September. 
Parliament will sit on Tuesday for the first time in three months and Morrison is expected to be grilled by opposition Labor over his response to the bushfire crisis and a scandal over sports funding.
Morrison came under fire from voters in December when it was revealed he was on a family holiday in Hawaii as the country's bushfire crisis escalated. 
When two fire fighters were killed, forcing him to return, his initial inaction and later refusal to link the fires with climate change drew criticism that he lacked leadership at a time of national crisis.
The margin of victory in the Nationals leadership vote was not disclosed, although local media reported McCormack retained his position by a single vote.
With spiraling reports of the razor thin margin of victory, another leadership challenge is widely expected.

""Another leadership contest is all but certain, and in the not so distant future,"" said Chris Salisbury, professor of political science at the University of Queensland.

1543,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 07:43PM ET</span>",British aviation industry outlines plans for net-zero emissions by 2050,"By Susanna Twidale
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's aviation industry has set out plans to reach a target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, even with the building of a third runway at Heathrow airport which is expected to drive up flight numbers.
The plans were published on Tuesday by the Sustainable Aviation coalition of companies in the British sector, including engine-maker Rolls Royce (L:RR), airline easyJet (L:EZJ), BP's (L:BP) aviation fuel arm AirBP and planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR).
Meeting the emissions target is likely to require several major changes in the industry, such as more efficient aircraft and a significant increase in the use of sustainable aviation biofuels, which are currently not widespread.
It may appear a tough goal, given air passenger numbers are expected to grow 70% by 2050, pushing up the number of flights. But the industry, which accounts for around 7% of Britain's emissions, says it will also offset its own emissions by funding reductions elsewhere.
Carbon offset projects can include planting trees or helping to fund renewable power projects such as wind or solar in developing countries.
The coalition said the emissions target could be met despite the expected business growth, adding: ""This includes the opening of a third runway at Heathrow by around 2030.""
However critics say offsetting emissions reduces incentives for the drastic emissions cuts needed to slow global warming and does not always bring the intended benefits; for instance, new trees may not grow as quickly as promised.
The Heathrow expansions plans, which include building the first full-length new runway in the London area for 70 years, are also opposed by climate protesters and some local residents.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has opposed Heathrow’s expansion in the past, but lawmakers approved the plans in 2018.
The aviation sector's plans are in line with Britain's target to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It was the first G7 country to set such a goal, which will require wholesale changes in the way people travel, eat and consume electricity.
(Graphic: Britain's aviation net zero road-map - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8392/8373/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
CARBON PRICING
EasyJet last year became the world's first major airline to operate with net-zero carbon across its flight network by using carbon offsets.
The coalition plan also expects carbon pricing - where CO2 producers pay the government for each tonne they emit - to play a role, as the cost is likely to be passed on to consumers and thus somewhat curb burgeoning passenger numbers.

NAIROBI/LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuters) - An Eritrean father yearning to be reunited with his four children after 15 years apart. An American woman adopting a Nigerian toddler. A Nigerian man desperate to be with his American wife and children.
These are some of the families waiting to see how they will be affected by President Donald Trump's expansion of the U.S. travel ban. 
Awet, who asked that Reuters use a nickname to avoid reprisals against his family, fled Eritrea in 2005. He is now a U.S. citizen.
Awet described how he hugged his four young children hard, whispering only to his weeping mother that he was leaving forever. For three days, he said, he hid under rocks by day and dodged hyenas and soldiers at night as he tried to cross the border. 
Awet spent four years as a refugee in Ethiopia and Kenya before being resettled to the United States in 2009. When a 2018 peace deal between Ethiopia and Eritrea made it possible for the children to leave Eritrea safely, he finally dared hope he would see them again. Awet had been trying to bring his children over on family visas for the past year.
But on Friday, Trump, a Republican, issued an expanded version of his travel ban that suspended immigrant visas - a category that includes family visas - for Eritreans and Nigerians. The other countries with new restrictions are Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Tanzania and Sudan. 
U.S. Homeland Security acting Secretary Chad Wolf said the restrictions were needed because the six countries had failed to meet U.S. security and information-sharing standards. But U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, called the ban ""discrimination disguised as policy.""
“Trump’s new law, for us, it's very hurtful,” said Awet, speaking by phone from his home in the United States. “At least let the children in ... those who want to come to be with their mother or father.”
Awet said he is still praying that he will see his children - now aged 14-18 - again one day. Their mother is in the Middle East.
""I’m leaving it to God,"" he told Reuters. 
""God and a lawyer,"" his attorney Kari Scofield chimed in.
""YOU ARE POWERLESS""
In the West African powerhouse of Nigeria, 37-year-old Californian Lynsey Elston is waiting to find out if or when her newly adopted daughter will be able to meet the rest of the family back in the United States. 
The former social worker always wanted to adopt. Three-year-old Eliana Ezinne arrived at her home in Nigeria on Christmas Eve 2019 after years of paperwork, interviews and uncertainty. 
""This is my child,"" she said as she cuddled the sleepy girl. ""I can’t be separated from my child.""
Hasan Shafiqullah, head of the Immigration Law Unit at The Legal Aid Society in New York, told Reuters that Elston can apply for Eliana’s citizenship only from inside the United States, and Eliana can enter only on an immigrant visa.
The 2017 version of the travel ban outlines which groups can qualify for waivers, including adoptees, and the expanded ban says it will follow the same guidelines. But the system for obtaining waivers has proven opaque and difficult to navigate, and there is an ongoing federal lawsuit challenging the government’s implementation of the process.
""The emotion I am feeling is anger,” Elston said at her home in an upscale neighborhood of Lagos. 
In the same city, a 38-year-old Nigerian man quit his job last month as he prepared to move to the United States with his two toddlers and wife - all U.S. citizens. He asked for anonymity to avoid prejudicing his visa application. 
The man said his mother and two sisters, also U.S. citizens, live in America, and he studied there and lived there for a decade. He wanted his children to grow up near his family, he said, and he considers America his second home. 
Asked what he will do if he cannot get a visa to move with his family, he drew in a long, slow breath and went silent. 

""I’m afraid to even consider that,"" he said at last. “You really are powerless.""

LISBON (Reuters) - Reacting to people who spoke out against trash from other countries being dumped in Portuguese landfills, the Socialist government announced on Monday it would adopt urgent measures to tackle the issue.
Two weeks ago, Reuters revealed that a private landfill in Sobrado, a village in Portugal's northern region, was receiving waste from various European nations.
Some 330,000 tonnes of ""amber list"" trash, which includes waste containing hazardous substances and needs prior approval, arrived in Portugal from abroad in 2018, a 53% increase from the year before, the country's environment agency APA said. 
Around 110,000 tonnes of this trash ended up in landfills, with the remaining waste being routed for valorization, the process of turning waste into a resource.
Italy was by far the country sending more trash to Portuguese landfills in 2018 but trash also arrived from Malta, Ireland, Greece and others, according to APA. 
Fed up residents joined forces and created their own environmental movements against the landfills, organized protests, started petitions and one of the groups even planned to file a lawsuit against Portugal's environment ministry. 
Pressured to find a solution, the ministry said on Monday it would from now on object to the entry of foreign trash destined for landfills and it would review landfills' licenses to receive organic waste and suspend them ""whenever justified"". 
This comes as a directive by the European Commission required member states to reduce the landfilling of municipal waste to a maximum of 10% by 2035.
There are 11 private landfills across Portugal allowed to receive foreign trash, APA said, and the ministry admitted some of the sites have dumped waste they were not legally allowed to receive. 
Portugal became an attractive destination for trash because of its low waste management fee for landfills, set at 9.90 euros per tonne in 2019 and 11 euros per tonnes this year, compared to a European average of 80 euros. 

These fees will also increase to discourage landfilling, the ministry said.

An Irish Times/ Ipsos MRBI poll published on Monday found support for left-wing Sinn Fein at 25%, making them a clear leader, with support for centre-right Fianna Fail at 23%. Support for governing Fine Gael was 20%.
Fine Gael and main opposition Fianna Fail both refuse to govern with Sinn Fein, citing their IRA links and opposing economic policies.
Sinn Fein, whose members were banned from speaking on Irish media until the mid-1990s before the end of Northern Ireland's three decades of conflict, is part of a power-sharing government in the British-run province, which it ultimately wants to reunite with the Irish Republic.
The party has said it will not go into coalition government without a commitment to immediately start planning for a referendum on the unification of Ireland, a vote it would push to be held within five years.
Approval for the government, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin all fell as Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald shot up seven points to 41% to become the post popular among all the main parties.
Despite the poll, Sinn Fein are unlikely to emerge as the largest party as it is running only 42 candidates, which is around half the number of candidates being fielded by both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.
Sinn Fein would need to get almost all 42 elected to the 160-seat chamber to give it a shot at emerging as the largest party.
Getting such a return would be difficult for any party, analysts say. Ireland's proportional representation system also favors parties running more than one candidate in larger constituencies.
A senior member of the Sinn Fein front bench David Cullinane responded to the opinion poll on Twitter by criticizing journalists who questioned his party's strategy.
""We are standing enough candidates to be serious contenders for Government. The demand for change is heart lifting.""
Earlier on Monday, Ireland's national broadcaster RTE reversed a decision to exclude party leader McDonald from a televised debate scheduled for Tuesday evening.
The broadcaster had planned to restrict the debate to Varadkar and Martin, the leaders of the two parties it considered most likely to lead the next Irish government based on empirical data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A woman who says Harvey Weinstein raped her broke down in sobs at the former Hollywood producer's sexual assault trial on Monday, as she read an email in which she described Weinstein as a ""pseudo father"" figure after the alleged attack.
Jessica Mann, 34, began weeping uncontrollably as she read the May 2014 email aloud under cross-examination by one of Weinstein's lawyers, Donna Rotunno. She was still crying after a brief break, prompting Justice James Burke to end testimony for the day.
Mann had testified Friday that Weinstein raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in March 2013, early in what she described as an ""extremely degrading"" relationship with him. She said the relationship continued in some form for years after that.
The 67-year-old former producer has pleaded not guilty to raping Mann and to sexually assaulting another woman, Mimi Haleyi. He faces life in prison if found guilty of predatory sexual assault, the most serious charge.
Mann wrote in the email to an actor she had been dating at the time that she was working through ""father issues"" when she was with Weinstein.
""Harvey was my father's age and he gave me all the validation I needed,"" she wrote.
Mann is expected to be cross-examined further on Tuesday.
Since 2017, more than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. Weinstein, whose films included ""The English Patient"" and ""Shakespeare in Love,"" has denied the allegations and has said any sexual encounters were consensual.
The trial is widely seen as a milestone in the #MeToo movement, in which women have accused powerful men in business, entertainment, media, and politics of sexual misconduct.
Earlier in Mann's cross-examination, Rotunno repeatedly suggested that Mann willingly had sex with Weinstein to advance her career. At one point she asked whether Mann ""manipulated"" Weinstein when she sent him friendly messages and asked to see him, even though she was not attracted to him.
""How I handled it to survive and process it, yeah, I guess you could say manipulation,"" Mann answered.
Rotunno also questioned Mann about the day of the alleged rape, quoting testimony she gave on Friday in which she said her ""worst nightmare"" would be for her friend and her agent to see her coming out of a hotel room with Weinstein. 
""Your worst nightmare, Jessica, in your words, was not the fact that you had just been taken against your will in a hotel,"" Rotunno said. ""Your words.""
""Abuse is embarrassing, so yeah,"" Mann said.
Rotunno went on to show Mann friendly emails she sent Weinstein after the alleged rape, including one in which she gave him her new contact information and said she would be ""happy to see your smile.""

Mann said she sent Weinstein flattering messages to avoid making him angry and show she was ""not a threat.""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - The murders of nearly 200 former fighters from the FARC rebels pose a difficulty in implementing Colombia's peace deal, an official said on Monday, but he insisted the government is committed to providing security and criticized complaints leveled by the FARC party leader.
The Andean country inked a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels in late 2016, ending the group's role in more than five decades of conflict which killed 260,000 people. 
Implementation of the accord, which saw some 13,000 FARC members demobilize, has faced some significant hurdles, including the announcement last year by several former commanders that they were rearming.
Leadership of the FARC, now a political party, has repeatedly decried what it says are mediocre government efforts to protect members targeted for assassination by dissident fighters and drug traffickers. 
Former rebels who lose confidence in the process could join dissidents or gangs, risking the peace deal.
""The security of ex-combatants is a priority for the government,"" Emilio Archila, the presidential adviser charged with overseeing implementation, told Reuters. ""It is a labor to which we give all importance and we are taking on the maximum responsibility that a government can have.""
The United Nations says 173 ex-combatants have been killed since peace was signed and many former rebels say killings are a source of deep fear.
Archila criticized an open letter written by FARC party leader Rodrigo Londono alleging the government is falling short.
Londono warned in the letter, which was published on Sunday, that the process is approaching a ""precipice.""
""It's a political letter,"" Archila said, adding the United Nations has praised implementation efforts. ""The point of view of the FARC party, which is an opposition party, can only have two fundamentals - it's a political manifestation or they don't know what the whole world knows.""
""I think that some of them in good faith think things could be going more quickly,"" Archila said.
The murder of former rebels is a challenge, Archila said, among others like rural development and caring for conflict victims.
Archila would not give specific figures on government spending on peace efforts, because the outlay takes place across several ministries, provinces and local municipalities and includes funding from international groups.
""The resources are substantially larger than what the national government has,"" Archila said.
The country has spent more than $7.4 million on hundreds of economic projects for former combatants, including agriculture, tourism and restaurants, according to government figures.
Venezuela's support for armed groups ""complicates"" implementation efforts, Archila added. Colombia has repeatedly accused President Nicolas Maduro of offering refuge to crime gangs, FARC dissidents and remaining rebels the ELN.

""They plan attacks there, execute them and then return and hide,"" Archila said.

(Reuters) - Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh announced on Monday that he has been diagnosed with ""advanced lung cancer"" but plans to continue to do his program ""as normally and as competently"" as he can while he undergoes treatment.
Limbaugh, 69, said on the air he first realized something was wrong over the weekend of his Jan. 12 birthday, after he began experiencing shortness of breath. He said his diagnosis was confirmed on Jan. 20 by two medical institutions.
Otherwise, Limbaugh told his listeners, he was for the moment ""experiencing zero symptoms.""
A mainstay of U.S. talk radio and the culture wars for more than 30 years, Limbaugh said he would be absent from the broadcast for ""the next couple of days as we figure out the treatment course of action and have further testing done.""
""But as I said, I'm going to be here as often as I can,"" he added. He said he hoped to return to the airwaves on Thursday.
The radio host began his announcement expressing discomfort at talking about himself, then went on to say: ""I have to tell you something today that I wish I didn't have to tell you.""
""The upshot is that I have been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer,"" he said. The shortness of breath he had thought might have been asthma turned out, he said, to be ""a pulmonary problem involving malignancy."" He made no mention of a prognosis.
Limbaugh has been a leading voice of the political right and a nemesis of the left since launching his show in 1985 amid the Republican revolution of Ronald Reagan, a man he has called ""the greatest president of the 20th century.""
Espousing a provocative, populist brand of social and political conservatism, Limbaugh has commanded a weekly audience of about 20 million listeners - he calls them ""ditto heads"" - during a three-hour daily broadcast airing on some 600 radio stations across the United States.
Detractors such as liberal former Senator Al Franken - a onetime comedian who wrote a book titled ""Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Liar"" - have criticized him as a divisive figure who routinely distorts the facts.
Still, Limbaugh's success helped shape the Republican party's agenda in the media and spawn a wave of conservative commentators on radio, television and the internet, among them Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck and Alex Jones.
Much of Limbaugh's appeal has been attributed to his brash, colorful style, and his delight in baiting liberals.
He coined the term ""femi-Nazis"" to disparage women's rights groups and once said the ""difference between Los Angeles and yogurt is that yogurt comes with less fruit.""

Limbaugh has experienced a variety of medical problems over the past couple of decades, including a loss of hearing reversed by a cochlear implant, as well as an addiction to prescription painkillers that landed him in rehab for several weeks in 2003.

The wounded toddler, a boy about 2 years old, was in stable condition at a local hospital, Texas A&M-Commerce Police Chief Bryan Vaughn said in a briefing. He provided no more information about the women or the child.
The three victims were found by officers responding to a phone call by a student at 10:17 a.m., he said.
Earlier, the university said in a statement that police were actively investigating three gunshot victims at the residence.
Officials at the campus, located about 65 miles (105 km) northeast of Dallas, did not respond to a request for further comment.
The shooting is the latest in a wave of gun violence on U.S. college and high school campuses in recent years. The bloodshed has fueled the debate over tighter restrictions on access to guns in the United States, where the Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms.
In October, two people were killed and about a dozen more were wounded at an off-campus Halloween party near the campus, part of the statewide Texas A&M University system. Many of the 750 people at the party were students, authorities said at the time.
""My son is safe today but tired of the nonsense on this campus!"" a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) user named Yolanda Temple posted after Monday's shooting at the campus, where 12,000 students take classes.
Students and staff were initially told to shelter in place, but campus police later lifted the order. Classes were canceled for the rest of Monday.

Shortly before the knifeman struck the police facility in Dieuze, near Metz, the local police operations center received warning that an atrocity was to be committed in the name of Islamic State, French news agency AFP quoted the local prosecutor as saying.
""We must relate the facts to a call received by the operational center of the gendarmerie shortly before, in which an individual declared that he was a soldier, that there was going to be carnage in Dieuze and that he was a member of Islamic State,"" prosecutor Christian Mercuri was quoted as telling a news conference in the area.
Several hours after the attack, there had been no claims of responsibility. A judicial source said the national antiterrorist prosecutor was not investigating the case at this stage.
The knifeman wounded one officer in the hand before he was shot and later taken to hospital, a spokesman for the gendarmerie said. 
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner praised the cool response of the officers who accosted the attacker.
The incident in Dieuze will raise further questions over security at police facilities. 
In October, an information technology assistant at the police headquarters in central Paris went on a knife rampage inside the building, killing four people before he was shot dead. He had converted to Islam a decade earlier. 
In Britain on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would act to stop the early release of convicted terrorists from jail after an Islamist militant stabbed two people in a street attack in south London.
Paris has suffered major attacks by Islamist militants in recent years.
Coordinated bombings and shootings in November 2015 at the Bataclan theatre and other sites around Paris killed 130 people - the deadliest attacks in France since World War Two.

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenia's centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), the biggest in parliament, has invited all other parties in the assembly to coalition talks following the resignation of centre-left Prime Minister Marjan Sarec.
A week after Sarec quit, saying his minority coalition government lacked support in parliament to push through important legislation, the SDS said on Monday coalition talks would start on Friday.
""Most probably we are facing the fourth early election (in a row) but of course it is also possible that a new ambitious and majority government is formed for the rest of this mandate,"" said SDS leader Janez Jansa, who is also an ex-prime minister.
Several parties have indicated they might be willing to join a government under the SDS although Jansa failed to form a government when his party emerged from the last election in 2018 as the NATO and European Union member state's biggest party.
The SDS has 26 of the 90 seats in parliament. Potential allies include the centre-left Party of Modern Centre with 10 seats, conservative New Slovenia with seven seats and pensioners' party Desus with five seats.
The centre-left SAB, which has five seats, has called for all parties except the SDS to explore whether it is possible form a government. It said parliament should be given a chance to change the electoral system to allow people to vote for candidates rather than parties. 
Serac's coalition included five centre-left parties and held 43 seats in parliament.
President Borut Pahor is due on Tuesday to start official talks with parliamentary parties and has until the end of this month to nominate a candidate for prime minister or tell the parliament he will not propose anyone.

If that happens, parliamentarians will have another 16 days to propose candidates. If the impasse continues, Pahor must call a snap election.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held talks with Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of Sudan's sovereign council, in the city of Entebbe in central Uganda.
""It was agreed to start cooperation leading to normalization of the relationship between the two countries,"" an Israeli statement said after the leaders met for two hours.
Normalizing relations with Sudan, where Arab states gathered in 1967 to issue what became known as the ""Three No's"" - no recognition of Israel, no peace with Israel and no negotiations with Israel - would allow Netanyahu to burnish his diplomatic credentials a month before the country's March 2 election. 
It could pave the way for the right-wing Israeli leader to pledge the deportation of Sudanese who make up around one fifth of illegal workers in Israel, a move backed by many of his supporters.
These migrants had previously argued that they could not be repatriated as they faced retribution for traveling to Israel, an enemy country of Sudan.
""Netanyahu believes that Sudan is moving in a new and positive direction,"" the Israeli statement said.
Sudan's leader, it added, ""is interested in helping his country go through a modernization process by removing it from isolation and placing it on the world map"".
Israel previously considered Sudan a security threat, due to Iran's suspected use of the country as a conduit for overland smuggling of munitions to the Gaza Strip. In 2009, regional sources said, Israeli aircraft bombed an arms convoy in Sudan.
But since Sudanese strongman Omar al-Bashir was ousted last year, Khartoum has distanced itself from Iran and no longer poses such a threat, Israeli officials say.
On Sunday, the United States invited Burhan to visit Washington, Sudan's sovereign council said, highlighting warmer bilateral ties.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo's parliament approved a new government on Monday after weeks of coalition talks, and Prime Minister Albin Kurti promised to take a tough stance in negotiations with Balkan rival Serbia. 
Kurti, 44, also told parliament before the vote of approval - won with 66 votes in the 120-seat assembly - that he would fight corruption and nepotism, which foreign businesses cite as the main obstacles to investment in Kosovo.
After weeks of coalition talks following a snap election in October, Kurti's leftist Vetevendosje (Self Determination) party reached a deal with the centre-right Democratic League of Kosovo on Sunday to create a government.
One of the main challenges facing the government, which also includes six groups representing Serbs, Turks, Bosniaks and other ethnic minorities, is negotiating with Serbia.
Serbia lost control of Kosovo after NATO bombing in 1999 to drive out Serb forces following a counter-insurgency in which more than 13,000 people, mainly Kosovo Albanians, were killed. 
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 but Belgrade does not recognize its independence and the two have not normalized ties. 
European Union-sponsored talks between Kosovo and Serbia came to a halt in November 2018 when Kosovo introduced a 100% tax on goods produced in Serbia. In the election campaign, Kurti said he would lift trade tariffs but introduce other measures.
“With Serbia we will have a full reciprocity in trade, politics and economy. I am ready to lead the talks with Serbia,” Kurti told parliament. 
He said he his government would sue Serbia before the International Court of Justice for crimes Serbian forces are accused of committing during the 1998-99 war. 
Kurti said he intends to introduce three-month military conscription and, promising to fight corruption, he said ""there will be no individual or company that will be more powerful than the state.""
The finance minister will be Besnik Bislimi, a macroeconomics professor who studied in Germany.

Kosovo held the October election following the resignation of Ramush Haradinaj as prime minister after he was summoned for questioning by an EU-funded war crimes court.

LILONGWE (Reuters) - Malawi's Constitutional Court on Monday annulled the May 2019 presidential vote that declared Peter Mutharika a winner and ordered a re-run after an application from opposition parties citing irregularities.
Mutharika, Malawi president since 2014, won the election with a 38.57% share of the vote, with opposition party leader Lazarus Chakwera getting 35.41% and Deputy President Saulos Chilima, who formed his own party, had 20.24% in the final tally.
The electoral commission declared Mutharika the winner despite complaints of irregularities including results sheets with sections blotted out or altered with correction fluid.
Mutharika had pledged to crack down on corruption and revive the economy in his second five-year term.
But Chakwera, the president's main rival, and Chilima rejected the results and filed a petition to the High Court asking it to nullify the results.
In a unanimous decision, a panel of five judges ordered that a new presidential vote be held within 150 days.
""It is almost impossible to have an election free of irregularities,"" said Justice Healey Potani, who headed the panel. ""However, in the present matter our finding is that the anomalies and irregularities have been so widespread, systematic and grave such that the integrity of the result was seriously compromised, and can't be trusted as the will of voters of the May 21, 2019 election."" 
In a landmark ruling for the country, the court describe the conduct of the electoral commission as ""very lacking and demonstrated incompetence"".
The status in the presidency would revert to before the elections, Potani said, which meant Chilima would be reinstated as vice president.
The court also directed Parliament to consider recalling the current electoral body, which is headed by Supreme Court of Appeal Judge Jane Ansah, to ""ensure smooth conduct of fresh elections.""
The streets in Lilongwe and the commercial capital Blantyre were unusually quiet ahead of the ruling, and many businesses were shut, fearing violence and looting from supporters of the losing side.
Security forces were out on the streets in large numbers, and the judges delivering the verdict were flown in on a military plane and arrived at the venue in armoured vehicles.
Malawi, a lakeside nation on the southern tip of the Great Rift Valley, is dependent on foreign aid and is frequently beset by drought which threatens the lives of thousands of people.

Former law professor Mutharika, 79, oversaw infrastructure improvements and a slowdown in inflation in his first five-year term, but critics accuse him of cronyism and failing to tackle graft.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda is ""studying"" the possibility of opening an embassy in Jerusalem, President Yoweri Museveni said on Monday, during a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Such a move would be seen internationally as a statement of support for Israel's claim for the city of Jerusalem to be its capital, a potential political win for Netanyahu less than a month before a national election on March 2.
""If a friend says I want your embassy here rather than there I don't see why there would be...,"" Museveni said before trailing off and continuing: ""we are really working, we're studying that.""
""You open an embassy in Jerusalem and I will open an embassy in Kampala,"" promised Netanyahu. ""We hope to do this in the near future.""
Palestinians claim East Jerusalem -- captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war -- for their own capital. But a peace plan presented last week by U.S. President Donald Trump envisaged a Palestinian capital outside Jerusalem's municipal limits.
The Palestinian leadership on Saturday rejected the plan and cut all ties with the United States and Israel, including those relating to security.
Uganda and Israel currently have no embassy in each other's country, though Museveni is a long-standing ally of Israel, which trains some elements of the Ugandan security forces.
Israel's embassy in Nairobi, in neighboring Kenya, currently handles its relations with Uganda. 
Uganda's Entebbe airport was the scene in 1976 of a dramatic rescue operation conducted by Israeli commandos to save nearly 100 mostly Israeli passengers on board an Air France airliner hijacked by Palestinian and German militants.
Netanyahu, whose elder brother Yonatan, a commander in the operation, was killed in the incident, said he found every visit to Uganda ""profoundly moving"" for this reason. Three passengers and all the hostage takers also died in the operation.
As well as the embassy issue, Netanyahu said Israel and Uganda were exploring the possibility of having direct flights and of closer cooperation in cyber security.
""Israel is coming back to Africa and Africa is coming back to Israel in a big way,"" he said.
Rights groups, critical of Museveni's record on human rights, are unlikely to welcome the prospect of increased cooperation with Israel on cyber security.

Security personnel in Uganda routinely break up opposition rallies with tear gas, beatings and detentions.

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 01:39PM ET</span>",Johnson says he will toughen rules on terrorism cases after London attack,"By Guy Faulconbridge and Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would act to stop the early release from prison of convicted terrorists following a street attack by an Islamist militant days after he was set free half way through his jail term.
Sudesh Amman, jailed in 2018 for possession of terrorist documents and disseminating terrorist publications, was shot dead by police on Sunday after he stabbed two people with a 10-inch (25 cm) knife in a rampage on a busy London street. 
Amman had previously praised the Islamic State group, shared an online al Qaeda magazine and encouraged his girlfriend to behead her parents.
Johnson he had come ""to the end of my patience"" with the freeing of offenders before they had completed their sentences and without any scrutiny. 
""We do think it's time to take action to ensure that people - irrespective of the law that we're bringing in - people in the current stream do not qualify automatically for early release,"" Johnson said in a speech.
The government had already promised tougher rules on terrorism since another former convict killed two people and wounded three more before police shot him dead near London Bridge in November. 
Justice minister Robert Buckland said that following Sunday's attack, emergency legislation would be introduced to make immediate changes in dealing with people convicted of terrorism offences.
""Offenders will no longer be released early automatically and any release before the end of their sentence will be dependent on the risk assessment of the parole board,"" he told parliament, adding the change would apply to serving prisoners.
Johnson said efforts to deradicalise and rehabilitate militants have had little success.
FAKE BOMB 
Amman had just been released from prison, according to police, having been jailed for promoting violent Islamist material.
He went on the rampage after strapping a fake bomb to his body. He stabbed two people, while a third suffered minor injuries caused by shattered glass when police opened fire.
Amman was under surveillance at the time by police.
In November 2018 he pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and the following month he was sentenced to more than three years in prison.
His mother, Haleema Faraz Khan, told Sky News he was a ""nice, polite boy"" who was radicalized online and in prison. She said she had spoken to her son hours before the attack, and he had seemed normal when she saw him days before. 
Britain has about 220 people in prison with terrorism convictions.
In 2016, Britain announced plans to isolate radical Islamists in high security jails to limit their ability to influence other inmates amid concerns that prisons were breeding grounds for extremists.
Ian Acheson, who carried out a review of the management of Islamist extremists in jail, said the prison service did not have the aptitude to manage terrorist offenders. 
""We may need to accept there are certain people who are so dangerous they must be kept in prison indefinitely,"" he told BBC radio.
Mark Rowley, formerly Britain's senior counter-terrorism police officer, said dozens of other people convicted of terrorism offences were due to be released early under the sentencing guidelines.
""VIRUS""
""We have an issue about if you have about 200 or so inside, the question is how do you detain them?"" Johnson said. 
""Do you detain them en bloc as it were in one group and try and keep them together because that avoids them infecting or passing the virus of their beliefs to others in jails. Or do you disperse and try to stop them reinfecting each other?"" 
Amman was 17 and living at home with his family when he first began committing terrorism offences, according to authorities. Police said he had downloaded material about making explosives and carrying out terrorist attacks.
Messages showed that he had discussed with his family, friends and girlfriend his extreme views and desire to carry out an attack, often focused on using a knife, prosecutors said. In one, he encouraged his girlfriend to behead her parents.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for Sunday's attack although police said it was an isolated incident.

""The aircraft, a Boeing 767-300, is designed to operate on one engine and our pilots are fully trained for this eventuality. Nonetheless, an emergency was declared in order to obtain landing priority,"" Air Canada said in a statement.
It said one of the aircraft's 10 tires reportedly ruptured during takeoff from Adolfo Suarez Madrid-Barajas airport.
Spanish airport operator AENA said earlier that the Air Canada plane had requested an emergency landing after reporting a ""technical issue"".
Spanish pilots union SEPLA said on Twitter, without citing any sources, that part of the plane's landing gear had fallen off and gone into one of the engines. It said the plane would have to burn for fuel for three hours before landing.
Air Canada did not mention any issue with the plane's landing gear in its statement.
In a message to passengers obtained by Spanish press including El Mundo and Spain's national broadcaster TVE, the plane's pilot told passengers there was a ""small problem with one of the wheels of the plane during takeoff"" and that they were burning fuel before returning to Madrid. 
The pilot called for calm and patience. 
Reuters was not able to independently verify recording's authenticity. 
A Transport Ministry source said there two problems: one with the landing gear and one with the engine. 
The incident occurred just hours after a drone sighting near the takeoff area at the airport caused a brief disruption, with 26 flights diverted away from Barajas.
The Canadian airliner called air traffic control 30 minutes after takeoff and requested a slot for an emergency landing, an AENA spokeswoman said. She could not say whether the Air Canada incident was in any way related to the previous shutdown.

According to Flightradar24, a tracking website monitoring the incident, the aircraft involved, a Boeing 767-300ER, is about 30 years old.

Born in British-occupied India to Irish parents, Hoare was best known for his exploits during the Congo Crisis in the 1960s and for leading an unsuccessful coup d'etat attempt in the Seychelles in the 1980s.
His son, Chris Hoare, wrote in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post that his father died on Feb. 2 in a care facility in Durban, South Africa.
Hoare was ""an officer and a gentleman – with a bit of brigand thrown in"", his son wrote.
Hoare ventured into Africa after serving in the British Army in World War Two.
An ardent anti-communist, he led a group of mercenaries in the Congo in the 1960s whose aim was to fight a revolt called the Simba rebellion.
He returned to prominence in the Seychelles, leading a coup attempt in 1981 that ended in fiasco when the weapons he and his fellow mercenaries - who were posing as a drinking club called Ancient Order of Froth-Blowers - had flown in were discovered at the airport.
Hoare wrote several books including ""Congo Mercenary"". His biography inspired the 1978 film ""The Wild Geese"", featuring actor Richard Burton."

He made his comments at a meeting with Josep Borell, the head of the EU’s foreign service, who traveled to Iran to try to reduce tensions in the Middle East after the U.S. killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani last month.
Under the deal, Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of most international sanctions, but the United States withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran. 
""The Islamic Republic of Iran is still ready for interaction and cooperation with the European Union for resolving issues and, whenever the opposite side completely upholds their commitments, Iran will return to its commitments,"" Rouhani said.
Iran began reducing its commitments under the nuclear deal last year to put pressure on the parties remaining in the accord to protect its economy from U.S. sanctions and allow the Islamic Republic to gain the full benefits outlined in the deal. 
Iranian officials have said all of their actions have been within the parameters of the nuclear deal, are reversible and that they are still committed to having their program monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
But Britain, France and Germany, which with the United States, Russia and China agreed the deal with Iran, declared Iran in violation of the 2015 pact last month and launched a dispute mechanism under which the matter could be referred back to the Security Council and U.N. sanctions reimposed.
Iran could quit the global nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) if European countries refer it to the U.N. Security Council over the nuclear agreement, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in late January.
The 1968 NPT has been the foundation of global nuclear arms control since the Cold War.
Iran says it has never pursued the development of nuclear weapons.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 12:08PM ET</span>","No return of bank bonuses, favorite for Irish finance minister says","By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Fianna Fail, the party leading polls ahead of Saturday's Irish election, would retain state-imposed curbs on bankers pay and bonuses if elected, the favorite to become Ireland's next finance minister told Reuters on Monday.
Ireland capped executive pay at 500,000 euros a year ($552,300) during the euro zone's costliest banking rescue a decade ago. It also banned all forms of variable pay and fringe benefits for even junior bank staff, restrictions lenders complain impedes them in attracting and retaining talent.
Fianna Fail finance spokesman Michael McGrath said banks had to fully deal with a years-long mortgage overcharging scandal and parliament introduce laws to make senior bankers accountable for such failings before he would consider the matter.
""It would be indefensible to lift caps and enable huge bonuses at a time when the banks are being investigated for misbehavior,"" said the 43-year-old accountant, who is seeking re-election in the southern city of Cork.
""We have had a history in the Irish banking system whereby bonuses were paid on the back of lending volume -- much of it was inappropriate lending that never should have taken place. We have been badly burned and I think we have to tread very carefully.""
McGrath said he would examine how Ireland's banks avail of corporation tax loss relief if he became finance minister but would not make any changes that would leave the state worse off by impacting the majority state-owned lenders' capital or value.
He said he would retain the 150 million euro annual levy paid by the banks at the current level. 
TAX VETO
McGrath, the main opposition finance spokesman in parliament since 2011, could be taking over the top job while new global rules are finalised into how multinational firms pay corporate tax -- a direct threat to Ireland's low 12.5% rate that has helped attract some of the world's biggest companies. 
Like the current government, Fianna Fail would strongly oppose an EU-wide tax on big internet firms in favor of the global reforms being sought by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
""We believe that fair tax competition needs to be protected and that's our bottom line going into any discussions. There is a veto at EU level, we would uphold that and not allow Ireland's corporate tax rate or regime be decided at EU level,"" he said.
""I believe that retaining a corporate tax advantage is imperative for Ireland. It is not the only reason why we have close to a quarter of a million people directly employed by multinationals but tax has been central to our success and to say otherwise would be misleading."" 
McGrath's party, which shares similar policies on Brexit and the economy with the ruling Fine Gael, has led in every opinion poll this year. It hopes to form a coalition with smaller parties but not surging Irish nationalists Sinn Fein, whom it refuses to govern with.
Most analysts say another ""confidence and supply"" minority government deal with Fine Gael, this time with Fianna Fail leading, is the most likely outcome. McGrath fears such an arrangement would struggle ""to stand the test of time.""
""On the current poll figures (forming a government) would be a challenge, for everyone,"" he said.

ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey said on Monday its military hit dozens of Syrian government targets after five Turkish soldiers were killed by shelling in Idlib in northwest Syria, where fighting threatens to test ties between Ankara and Moscow.
Turkey and Russia are on opposing sides in the fighting in Idlib and, though they work together elsewhere in Syria, President Tayyip Erdogan said Russian officials had been told they should ""stand aside"" in the conflict around Idlib.
Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said Turkish forces had hit 54 targets in Idlib in retaliation and ""neutralized"" 76 Syrian government soldiers, the state-owned Anadolu agency reported.
Erdogan had earlier said the retaliatory operations included the use of F-16 fighter jets and responded to what Turkey called intense shelling of its troops in Idlib, the last big rebel stronghold after nearly nine years of war in Syria.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, backed by Russian air power, have made large advances in Idlib, prompting Turkey to warn it may launch a military operation there unless the fighting is halted. 
""We are determined to continue our operations for the security of our country, people and our brothers in Idlib. Those who question our determination will soon understand they made a mistake,"" Erdogan said in Istanbul before flying to Kiev. 
Speaking later in the Ukrainian capital, he said developments in Idlib had become ""unmanageable"".
The Syrian Observatory, a war monitor based in Britain, said 13 members of the Syrian government forces had been killed in Turkish shelling. A Syrian state TV correspondent said there had been no casualties among its government forces.
Erdogan accuses Russia of violating a 2017 agreement to reduce fighting in the region, and charge that Russia denies.
Ankara and Moscow have also been regularly conducting joint patrols in northeastern Syria. It is not clear whether or how such cooperation would be affected by any strains in ties over Idlib but Turkish broadcaster NTV said that the patrol on Monday was canceled. Closer military ties between NATO member Turkey and Russia have meanwhile alarmed Washington and other Western allies.
Turkey has in recent days sent military vehicles, trucks and other reinforcements to the region in a challenge to Damascus and its Russian backers.
Rebels fighting to oust Assad, some of whom have been backed by Turkey, have also launched counter-attacks against the territorial gains by Assad's forces.
SHELLING IN AREA OF SARAQEB
A Turkish security official told Reuters the shelling that killed the Turkish soldiers was in the area of Saraqeb, a town 15 km (9 miles) east of Idlib city that lies at the junction of two main roads which Damascus wants to gain full control of.
Turkey's defense ministry said reinforcements had been on the move around Idlib. They were meant to prevent clashes in Idlib but were hit by Syrian shelling, it said, adding that a civilian member of its forces was also killed. 
The Russian defense ministry said the Turkish units came under fire from Syrian government forces after moving without notifying Russia, though Turkey said it had coordinated its military movements with Moscow.
Though Erdogan said fighter jets were involved in Turkey's response, the Russian defense ministry said Turkish planes had not violated Syria's border and no air strikes on Syrian troops had been recorded. 
A spokesman said the Kremlin remained concerned about militant groups around Seraqeb where Turkish forces were hit.
The fighting in Idlib has displaced hundreds of thousands civilians. The civil defense in rebel-held territory said at least nine Syrian civilians, including four children, were killed on Monday in a Russian air strike on a van carrying displaced people near the city of Aleppo, northeast of Saraqeb. 

Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million refugees from Syria, fears a new wave of migrants from Idlib. In Kiev, Erdogan said there were close to 1 million people in Idlib marching towards Turkish borders as a result of a Russian-backed Syrian government offensive.

BAQA AL-GHARBIYYE, Israel (Reuters) - Thousands of Israeli Arabs, many waving Palestinian flags, demonstrated in this town in Israel at the weekend to voice their fear that U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East plan could see them stripped of their rights as Israeli citizens.
Trump's proposal, disclosed last week, would see Israel keep its settlements in the occupied West Bank.
But it also raised the possibility that 11 Arab border towns abutting the West Bank would become part of a new Palestinian state - alarming Israel's 21 percent Arab minority.
""Israel wants to get rid of these people - their land, their history and their space,"" said Mohammed Barakeh, a protester and former Arab member of Israel's parliament.
Like their Palestinian brethren in the West Bank and Gaza, Arabs in Israel have criticized Trump's plan, which suggested what it billed as a ""two-state"" solution for the decades-long conflict.
Critics say that by handing Jewish settlements in occupied territory to Israel and keeping Palestinians under Israeli security control, a viable independent state is impossible.
On Monday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas dismissed the land swap idea, saying: ""We do not agree at all, in any way, to swap land and residents from Israel to (Palestine)"".
Israel's Arabs – predominantly Muslims, Christian and Druze – are mostly the descendants of the Palestinians who remained in their homes or were internally displaced following the 1948 war that surrounded Israel's creation.
Many identify as Palestinians and regularly voice solidarity with those in Gaza and the West Bank.
But they fear losing their rights and ties to the land they have lived on for generations if they are moved from Israel to Palestinian rule in the West Bank.
Ayman Odeh, who heads a coalition of mainly Arab parties in Israel's parliament, said Trump's proposal was ""a green light to revoke the citizenship of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arab citizens who live in northern Israel.""
Feelings also ran high at the weekend in Umm al-Fahm, a town on a hill that looks down into the West Bank across an Israeli military barrier that winds along its northern boundary.
""I am a Palestinian Arab and a citizen of Israel,"" said Umm Mahmoud, 42, a housewife from Umm al-Fahm, as she shopped for home supplies.
""I cannot accept being transferred to the West Bank. Although we are the same, we cannot leave our land, lives and traditions. Although they (West Bank Palestinians) are our family, it is not possible,"" she said.
""HYPOTHETICAL MATTER""
The Trump plan said land swaps could include both populated and unpopulated areas and redrawing the borders of Israel so that the so-called Triangle Communities become part of the State of Palestine would need to be agreed on by both parties.
David Friedman, the Trump-appointed U.S. Ambassador to Israel who was closely involved in the framing of the Middle East plan, denied that residents of Arab towns in Israel would lose citizenship if they eventually fell under Palestinian jurisdiction.
""No one is being stripped of citizenship. We don't propose that,"" he told reporters last Wednesday.
Some Israeli government officials have privately voiced reservations about the idea.
""I regard this as a hypothetical matter. This is something the sides can weigh as an option after the plan is implemented,"" Gabi Ashkenazi, a senior member of the opposition Blue and White Party, told Israeli Internet television channel Ynet.
""We unequivocally regard the (Arab) citizens of Israel as equal citizens,"" Ashkenazi said."

The coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe, from shops barring entry to Chinese tourists, online mocking or the country's exotic meat trade and surprise health checks on foreign workers.
In the Philippine capital, Adamson University asked all its Chinese students to observe a 14-day self-quarantine as a precaution. Criticism of that decision led the university to extend the quarantine to all students and staff who had traveled to areas where the virus was prevalent.
""China has been kind to us, we can only also show the same favor to them. Stop this xenophobia thing"", Duterte said in a news conference after meeting with agencies on the coronavirus, which claimed its first fatality in the Philippines on Saturday.
The virus has spread to more than a dozen countries, many of them in Southeast Asia, which has sensitive relations with China amid concerns about Beijing's political clout in the region and sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea.
China-Philippines relations have often been frosty over maritime disputes, but ties have warmed under Duterte, who prefers not to provoke Beijing and wants to tap it for loans and investment.
""They are blaming the Chinese that (the virus) came from China, but it could always incubate in some other place"", said Duterte. He assured the public there was no reason to panic and that ""everything is well"" in the country.
""It is not the fault of anybody. Not the Chinese, not the Filipino, no one"", Duterte said.
The Chinese Embassy in Manila said on Friday it was paying close attention to the epidemic in the Philippines and is communicating with its government.
The Philippines is host to dozens of offshore gambling operators that employ many Chinese workers.
Chinese tourists accounted for 22% of the 7.5 million visitors to the Philippines between January and November last year, making China the second-highest nation of origin for international travelers to the country.
To contain the spread of the virus, the Philippine on Sunday expanded its travel ban to include all foreigners coming from China, widening an earlier restriction that covered only those from Hubei province.
Duterte said the government is looking at the possibility of using a drug rehabilitation facility donated by a Chinese philanthropist to quarantine Filipino evacuees from Hubei."

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union and Britain clashed over a post-Brexit trade deal on Monday, with the two sides setting out very different visions of a future relationship that could result in the most distant of ties.
Almost three days since Britain officially left the EU, both sides presented their aims, with the question of whether London will sign up to EU rules to ensure frictionless trade shaping up to be the defining argument of the negotiations.
Both want to secure a trade agreement, but Britain has set a deadline of the end of the year and the EU has warned that if Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants a no-tariff, no-quota deal, he will have to sign up to its rules to ensure fair competition.
Johnson said he would not do that, in a speech that harked back to Britain's past trading successes, promising that his government would again be a champion of free trade and jealously guard his country's new-found ""sovereignty"".
""Humanity needs ... some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with his cloak flowing as the supercharged champion of the right of populations of the earth to buy and sell freely among each other,"" he said, referring to Superman's alternate character.
Saying Britain was ready ""for that role"", he went on to say London was ready to accept an agreement with the EU, the world's biggest trade bloc, similar to that enjoyed by Canada, whose rules are not aligned with those of the EU.
""There is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment or anything similar, any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules,"" Johnson said.
Promising to maintain ""the highest standards"", he said that if such a deal was not achievable ""then our trade will have to be based on our existing Withdrawal Agreement with the EU"".
""The choice is emphatically not 'deal or no-deal'. The question is whether we agree a trading relationship with the EU comparable to Canada's – or more like Australia's,"" he said in the Painted Hall at the Greenwich Royal Naval College where grand 18th Century paintings celebrate Britain's naval power.
At the moment, much of EU-Australia trade runs along basic World Trade Organization rules, though there are specific agreements for certain goods. Australia is in the process of negotiating a trade deal with the 27-nation EU.
AMBITIOUS DEAL
The acceptance of what for many experts is little more than a so-called no-deal Brexit sent sterling lower by more than 1%.
With the talks not due to start until March, the tough talk could be part of a negotiating strategy for both sides.
But for Johnson, according to sources, December's election, which handed him a large majority in parliament, was an endorsement of his policy of putting Britain's right to set its own rules and to trade with other nations above the demands of business for continued frictionless trade.
The EU, in turn, does not want to see Britain undercut its rules.
Brussels says it wants an ambitious zero-tariffs and zero-quotas trade deal, but has been clear this will be conditional on open and fair competition between the two, the EU's Brexit negotiator said. 
Michel Barnier, unveiling the European Commission's mandate for talks with Britain on their future relationship, said there should be a level playing field over the long term on social, state aid and environmental standards.
""You cannot accuse us of a lack of ambition,"" he told a news conference in Brussels. ""First and foremost, we will defend the interests of the union, its citizens and its businesses.""
""We'll continue to prepare for a situation where no deal is being arrived at. We certainly don't want that to happen. We'll work to avoid that, but if we can't manage a deal by the end of the year there will be a cliff-edge on many fronts.
""There will some areas where there'll be no other solution. I'm thinking about trade and fisheries here,"" Barnier added.
Touching on one of the thorniest parts of the future negotiations, Barnier said a free trade agreement must include a deal on fisheries that would give reciprocal assess to waters, and conditions on these must be established by July 1, 2020.

""We are ready to offer all this even though we know that there will be strong competition between the UK, our immediate neighbor, and the EU in the future,"" he said.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 10:14AM ET</span>","In death, Iran's Soleimani bequeaths perilous dilemma for Iraq","By Samia Nakhoul, John Davison and Ahmed Rasheed
BAGHDAD (Reuters)- - A month after a U.S. missile killed him, Qassem Soleimani looms as large over Iraq's fractured democracy as he ever did alive.
The death of the Iranian general removed a shrewd guiding hand on the pro-Tehran Shi'ite militias who revered him, setting off a menacing new instability in Iraq's fragile political arena.
Now the shadowy power structure he helped to build -- a state above the state made up of Iraq's formal institutions -- risks colliding ever more bloodily with a powerful youth-led anti-Iranian protest movement.
That in turn poses a quandary for Iraq's leaders, torn by a choice between Iranian tutelage and meeting the demands of a generation seeking an end to Iran's dominance.
They know that if they tilt too far towards Tehran they risk worse political turmoil and Iraq written off as a failed state, analysts and diplomats say. 
""There is mounting Iraqi determination to reject the increasing Iranian influence and this is what we are seeing in the protests,"" said a prominent Iran-aligned Shi’ite party leader, who declined to be identified. 
""The Iranians should review their policies if they want to build good relations with Iraq.""
While Soleimani's death weakens Iran, it also leaves a damaging security vacuum in Iraq because the veteran commander held final sway over Tehran's Iraqi paramilitary forces.
Analysts and diplomats fear the absence of his seasoned leadership, and his ability to dial militias up and down, could result in an Iraq with the paramilitary equivalent of a Frankenstein's monster on the loose.
One of the most powerful Iraqi paramilitary leaders, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a close Soleimani confidant, died in the same U.S. drone strike on Jan. 3. Fear and uncertainty among his fellow militia chieftains has sent many of them into hiding, changing residence and even phone numbers. 
""Even Soleimani and Muhandis found it hard at times to keep Kataib Hezbollah (the militia founded by Muhandis) under control and there's now a stronger possibility they might act on their own,"" says one Western envoy to Baghdad.
In Iraq, months-long protests against political elites and their Iranian patrons continue, having forced the resignation of the prime minister, an important position of formal power alongside the 329-seat parliament and the president.
But the protests have made no change to the pro-Iranian paramilitary groups. Estimated to number up to 160,000 men in total, these groups are built around a core of militias founded, trained, armed and ideologically loyal to Iran.
PROXY WAR ON IRAQI SOIL
Some of those militias have abused their increased power to shoot dozens of demonstrators, whose protests against corruption and incompetence have won the endorsement of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq’s paramount religious authority.
""The militias became monsters, greedy and too powerful to handle,"" says a senior politician with long experience of trying to govern Iraq. ""They extorted money from businesses, they wanted their share from everything, even forcing the government to give their loyalists jobs and state contracts.""
A leading Iraqi politician says Soleimani’s power by the end was so great he behaved like a viceroy on his visits, convening not just allies but forces from across the spectrum.
While both Iran and Iraq worry about the risk of a full-on conflict between Iraqi Shi’ite forces and youths indignant at Tehran's domination of their country, there is also fear that Iraq may become a war zone between Iran and the United States.
Unlike in most of the Arab world, Shi’ites are a majority in Iraq, propelled into power by the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 that toppled the minority Sunni dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.
Through subsequent civil war, with sectarian rival elites looting the state, that majority has failed to build cohesion around the power-sharing with the Sunni Arabs and self-governing Kurdish minority decreed by a 2003 post-war constitution.
The last round of civil war, against Islamic State's (IS) short-lived caliphate, was a huge leap forward for Iran's Iraqi militias, which performed much more strongly than the country's military, U.S.-trained but hollowed out by corruption.
Grouped inside the umbrella of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) or al-Hashid al-Shaabi, they formed after an edict by Sistani and helped turn the Sunni jihadi tide. A spokesman for the PMF could not immediately be reached for comment. 
RISING ANTI-IRAN SENTIMENT
Anti-Iran sentiment among the activists encamped in Baghdad's Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ) since October runs high. 
While they did finally topple Abdul-Mahdi – replaced on Saturday by Prime Minister Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi – they want an independent government free of foreign and especially Iranian tutelage, and to hold the killers of protesters accountable.
Protesters highlight how Iran has flooded the Iraqi market with its own goods, from electronic equipment, to furniture, cars, as well as dairy and agricultural products.
""All the goods in the market are Iranian, they killed our economy. Our politicians and militias are stooges for Iran, they gave them import licences for all this. Iraq used to feed all nearby countries with its agricultural products and now it’s all gone,"" said Abbas Roweih, 23, an unemployed medical technician.
The Shi’ite party leader argues that the future of an Iraq with a young population – half under 17 and who never knew Saddam's tyranny – lies with the protesters and their rage. 
""The young Iraqi democracy needed an earthquake to address the demands of these youths,” said the leader.
HIGH STAKES FOR IRAQ
Despite his close links to Iran, this leader says that even politicians close to the Shi’ite-dominated government and the PMF believe the militias have become a state above the state.
He said prime minister Abdul-Mahdi was taken by surprise when in December militia-instigated anti-U.S. protests that followed air raids on Kataib Hezbollah targets turned into a siege of the U.S. embassy and reached its gates.
When Abdul Mahdi could not reach militia leaders during the siege who had switched off their phones, he sent someone from his office with an open phone line to them and asked them to withdraw from the embassy site, the leader said. They did not.
Many observers and analysts believe it was TV footage of Iraqi militiamen breaching the perimeter of the Baghdad embassy – a throwback to the American trauma of the hostage crisis at the U.S. embassy in Tehran of 1979 – that triggered President Donald Trump’s decision to order the attack on Soleimani.
""We don’t want to be enemies of Iran but we want relations to be based on mutual respect and for (Iran) not to use Iraq in proxy wars with the United States,"" warns the party leader.
Iraq's problems don't end there.
One is that Iranian proxy forces in Iraq follow Iran's doctrine of Velayat al-Faqih (Guardianship of the Jurisprudent) that vests ultimate authority in the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. This notion is foreign to Sistani and other top Iraqi clerics who believe it mires religion in politics.
Diplomats believe Iraq could pay economically for enacting Iran's agenda: If Iran does manage to prevail upon Iraq to force out the 5,000 U.S. troops, this might lead Washington to sanction its economy and leaders, diplomatic sources say. Iraq’s parliament has already voted to expel U.S. troops.
Many diplomats doubt the will and ability of Iraq’s fractious, disunited political class to avoid this outcome. 

""If the Iraqi government acts to have foreign forces withdraw ... then there are probably all sorts of consequences,"" said a U.S. official.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bereaved families and survivors of London's 2017 Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people, on Monday accused those responsible for wrapping the building in combustible materials of trying to sabotage a public inquiry into the disaster.
The blaze that destroyed the 23-storey social housing block, owned by the wealthy borough of Kensington and Chelsea, was Britain's worst in a residential building since World War Two.
The public inquiry has established that a flammable cladding system fitted to external walls during a recent refurbishment was the key factor in the unstoppable spread of the fire. [nL8N27F40M]
Contractors involved in the refurbishment had been due to start giving evidence on Monday, but that was postponed after some made a last-minute request for guarantees that they would not be prosecuted over anything they told the inquiry. [nL8N29Y4JW]
""The timing of this application appears disingenuous and an attempt at sabotage,"" Stephanie Barwise, a lawyer representing some of the survivors and bereaved families, told the inquiry on Monday, describing her clients as outraged.
Many in the Grenfell community have called for those responsible for the condition of the building to face criminal prosecution.
Police conducting a separate investigation have said they are considering charges including gross negligence manslaughter and corporate manslaughter but will not announce any decision until the public inquiry has ended. [nL5N20T6YO]
Begun in September 2017, the inquiry aims to establish exactly what went wrong at Grenfell Tower, why it happened and who was responsible. Previously, the contractors and officials involved in the refurbishment had indicated they would cooperate fully in the interest of uncovering the truth.
Instead, Barwise and other lawyers argued, they had waited until the 11th hour to throw a curve ball, inflicting new anguish on the families just as the long-awaited moment of accountability was supposed to arrive.
DIFFICULT CHOICE
The inquiry chairman, retired judge Martin Moore-Bick, now faces a difficult choice. If he agrees to the contractors' request, he risks alienating the Grenfell community. If he rejects it, he faces the prospect of key witnesses refusing to answer questions, citing their right not to self-incriminate.
Richard Millett, a lawyer representing the inquiry itself, condemned the timing of the request, but said that on balance, it was in the inquiry's interest to grant it.
""Without it, you will not get the truth,"" he told the chairman.
A lawyer representing the Metropolitan Police said the force would not give a view because it did not want to be seen to be trying to influence the gathering of evidence.
Barwise said it was impossible to know how any guarantee regarding evidence to the inquiry, if given, might affect subsequent prosecutions, which was one of the reasons why her clients were so upset about the request.
After hearing submissions from all the lawyers, Moore-Bick adjourned the hearing indefinitely to consider what to do.
The request came from current and former employees of Rydon Maintenance Ltd, the main contractor in charge of the refurbishment, as well as from Harley Facades Ltd, a sub-contractor that dealt with the cladding.
The same request was also made by Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, which used to manage social housing in the borough and was stripped of its responsibilities after the fire.
Certain survivors have alleged that official neglect of their ethnically mixed, largely low-income community had played a part in the tragedy, and that warnings from residents that there were fire hazards in the tower had been ignored."
1576,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 09:31AM ET</span>","Greek police fire teargas at protesting migrants, refugees on Lesbos","ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek police fired teargas to disperse migrants and refugees protesting on Monday about conditions in migrant camps on the island of Lesbos and the slow pace of processing asylum requests.
Violence broke out near the Kara Tepe camp, a police official said, after hundreds of people marched from the island's congested migrant camps to the city of Mytilene. 
Aid groups have described living conditions in some of Greece's island camps as appalling. 
A Reuters witness said the protesters were mainly women and children. They held signs reading ""Freedom"". 
Some evaded a police cordon and crossed a slope to reach Mytilene, where a group tried to set up tents. 
Lesbos has been one of the main gateways into Europe for migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond. Hundreds of thousands of people passed through Greece at the peak of Europe's migrant crisis in 2015 and 2016.
Last year, more than 74,000 refugees and migrants arrived in Greece, among them 3,500 children, according to the United Nations refugees agency UNHCR. Most of them arrived on the islands Lesbos, Chios and Samos, crossing from Turkey.
The conservative government elected in July has announced plans to ""decongest"" the islands, shut down existing camps and replace them with holding centers that will process new arrivals and people whose asylum applications have been rejected. 
The centers that will close include the Moria camp on Lesbos, which was set up to accommodate 2,850 people but hosts at least five times that number.

Last week, the government said it wants to install a floating barrier in the Aegean Sea, off Lesbos, to deter migrants arriving at its shores.

""We are not afraid of failure and we will not lose hope. With your prayers and trust in God, the Zafar satellite by the end of this week ... will be heading toward an orbit of 530 km from Earth,"" Iranian Minister of Information and Communications Technology Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi tweeted.
Iran had at least two failed satellite launches last year.
The United States fears long-range ballistic technology used to put satellites into orbit could also be used to launch nuclear warheads. Tehran denies that satellite activity is a cover for missile development and says it has never pursued the development of nuclear weapons.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed sanctions on Iran following Washington's 2018 withdrawal from an international accord designed to curb Iran's nuclear program.
Trump said the nuclear deal did not go far enough and did not include restrictions on Tehran's missile program.
Tensions have reached the highest level in decades between Iran and the United States after Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike on Jan. 3, prompting Iran to retaliate with a missile attack against a U.S. base in Iraq.
Iran launched its first satellite Omid (Hope) in 2009 and the Rasad (Observation) satellite was sent into orbit in June 2011. Tehran said in 2012 that it had successfully put its third domestically-made satellite Navid (Promise) into orbit.

GAZA (Reuters) - Bridegrooms in the Gaza Strip are finding marriage a path to debtors' prison rather than to happiness.
Wedding celebrations cost around $10,000 in the Palestinian enclave, but a tradition of strong family ties and large gatherings often trumps financial common sense.
So with unemployment in Gaza topping 50% and the economy in a parlous state, many bridegrooms turn for help to money-lending associations that offer wedding loans ranging from $2,000 to $4,000, but repayment often becomes impossible. 
A spokesman for the police in Gaza, which is governed by the Islamist Hamas group, said that of 100,000 debt-default cases opened last year, 22% involved marriage loans.
Eyad al-Zahar said he had turned into ""a regular visitor to prison"" since taking such a loan. Now a father of two, Zahar, 24, used to install marble tiles but is now unemployed.
""I sold my wife's jewelry, my washing machine and the boiler,"" he told Reuters, sitting on a chair in a room otherwise empty of furniture.
As he spoke, rain leaked through the metal ceiling and his family scurried to place plastic pots to catch the drops.
Zahar said he had been jailed at least five times for failing to repay his loan, spending 10 to 12 days behind bars each time until someone bailed him out.
Salama Al-Ewadi, director of the Farha Society, which lends money to help facilitate marriages, said some 20 groups like his own had shut down because of poor repayment rates.
Amid crushing hardship in the territory, Ewadi said business had been falling off, even at marriage loan societies.
""We used to have 50 clients per month. In 2019 the number ranged between 15 and five,"" he said. Currently, his office is pursuing legal action against 120 clients, and another 600 have fallen behind in their repayments.
""THERE WILL BE AN EXPLOSION""
Three wars between Israel and Gaza militants, tight Israeli restrictions along the Gaza border and divisions between Hamas, which has run Gaza since 2007, and the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority of President Mahmoud Abbas have deepened the economic crisis.
In a bid to squeeze Hamas, Abbas has slashed salaries of tens of thousands of PA-hired workers in Gaza and suspended those of others. Hamas, considered a terrorist group by the West, has been unable to pay full salaries to its own 40,000 public employees for many years.
Local economists said nearly 1,000 small to large businesses had shut their doors in 2018 and 2019.
Naeem Al-Siksik, CEO of one of the largest plumbing and infrastructure companies in Gaza and the West Bank, said the firm that once employed 400 people was now down to 146 and was struggling to stay in business.

""People are melting down. If things do not improve there will be an explosion here because people have nothing to lose,"" he said.

KIEV/DUBAI (Reuters) - A leaked audio recording of an Iranian pilot talking to the control tower in Tehran shows that Iran knew immediately it had shot down a Ukrainian airliner last month, despite denying it for days, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said.
On the recording, played on a Ukrainian television station late on Sunday, the pilot of another plane can be heard saying he saw ""the light of a missile"" in the sky before Ukrainian International Airways flight 752 crashed in an explosion.
Tehran blamed the Ukrainian authorities for leaking what it described as confidential evidence, and said it would no longer share material with Ukraine from the investigation into the crash.
All 176 people aboard the flight were killed when the plane crashed shortly after takeoff en route from Tehran to Kiev on Jan. 8.
The leaked audio ""proves that the Iranian side knew from the start that our plane had been hit by a missile,"" Zelenskiy said in a television interview.
""He says that 'it seems to me that a missile is flying', he says it in both Persian and English, everything is fixed there,"" Zelenskiy said.
After denying blame for three days, Iran acknowledged shooting the plane down, saying it had done so by mistake while under high alert, hours after it had fired at U.S. targets in retaliation for a U.S. strike that killed an Iranian general.
Iran has said it worked as quickly as possible to determine what happened to the plane. The Iranian commander who first acknowledged the plane had been shot down said he informed the authorities on the day of the crash.
Iran has faced pressure from Ukraine and other countries whose citizens were on board the flight to send evidence abroad for international investigations.
The Iranian official in charge of accident investigations at Iran's Civil Aviation Organization called it a ""strange move"" by Ukraine to release the confidential recording.
""This action by the Ukrainians led to us not sharing any more evidence with them,"" the official, Hassan Rezaifar said, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency.
In the recording, a pilot for Aseman, an Iranian airline, can be heard radioing the control tower that he has seen what he believes is a missile.
""Is this an active area? There’s lights like a missile. Is there anything?"" the pilot says.
""Nothing has been reported to us. What’s the light like?"" the controller replies. The pilot says: ""It's the light of a missile.""
The control tower can be heard trying and failing to raise the Ukrainian airliner on the radio. The pilot of the Iranian plane then says he has seen ""an explosion. In a very big way, we saw it. I really don’t know what it was.""
Ukraine International Airways said in a statement the recording provided ""yet more proof that the UIA airplane was shot down with a missile, and there were no restrictions or warnings from dispatchers of any risk to flights of civilian aircraft in the vicinity of the airport.""

Rezaifar, the Iranian aviation official, said in the Mehr report that the Ukraine investigation team, as well as all other foreigners involved in the investigation, have left Iran.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",Jailbreak in the 'city of blood': Brazil's drug gangs overrun Paraguay,"By Gabriel Stargardter and Daniela Desantis
PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO, Paraguay (Reuters) - Luis Alves da Cruz awoke around 3 a.m. to a commotion in the Paraguayan prison he called home. 
A small-time Brazilian drug smuggler, da Cruz saw fellow inmates dressed head-to-toe in black. ""We're breaking out,"" one of them told him. ""Are you coming?"" 
Within minutes, da Cruz was among 75 prisoners who fled the facility in the early hours of Jan. 19 in one of the most audacious jailbreaks in Paraguay's history. 
The fugitives were members of the First Capital Command, Brazil's largest and most powerful gang, known by its Portuguese acronym PCC. The escape underscores the organization's growing influence in Paraguay, whose weak institutions have proven no match for the PCC and other fast-growing Brazilian criminal syndicates that have set up shop here.
Authorities at the prison in the city of Pedro Juan Caballero near the Paraguay-Brazil border knew what the PCC was planning, according to Paraguay's Justice Minister Cecilia Pérez. Some were complicit, she said, while others looked the other way out of fear of retribution. Thirty-two prison officials, including the jail's warden, are now under arrest. 
""We're facing a security crisis whose epicenter lies in the prison system,"" Pérez told Reuters.
The Pedro Juan Caballero Regional Penitentiary did not respond to a request for comment.
Forty of the escapees, including da Cruz, were Brazilians. So far, only 11 prisoners have been recaptured. Da Cruz, was nabbed within days near the Brazilian town of Dourados. Reuters obtained exclusive access to the testimony he gave to Brazilian police.
Da Cruz, 30, told them that guards at the Paraguayan lockup had helped facilitate the escape. He said he was among those who fled through a fan-ventilated tunnel that prisoners had dug with trowels and illuminated with light bulbs tacked to the earthen walls with forks. The tight, muddy passage started in a cell occupied by PCC members and exited just beyond the jail's exterior wall.
Senior prisoners didn't bother getting dirty, da Cruz said in his testimony; they simply walked out the front door. Other recaptured prisoners gave similar accounts, Paraguayan police say.
""This (jailbreak) demonstrates that the PCC does what it wants, when it wants,"" said Juan Martens, an academic and security analyst based in the capital Asunción who has studied the PCC's role in Paraguay. ""The Paraguayan state represents no obstacle to its plans.""
'CITY OF BLOOD'
Sandwiched between Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia, Paraguay is one of the world's top marijuana producers and a key trans-shipment point for Andean cocaine. Paraguay is poor, with a GDP per capita in line with that of Namibia. It is also riddled with graft, trailing Venezuela as the second-most-corrupt country in South America, according to Transparency International's 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index.
As a result, it has become an attractive operational base for Brazilian gangs, including the Sao Paulo-based PCC, Rio de Janeiro's Red Command and a Porto Alegre syndicate with the pugnacious moniker Bullet In The Face. 
Authorities say Brazilian gangsters operate with near-impunity here, both inside and outside prison. The PCC, for example, actively ""baptizes"" non-affiliated prisoners into its ranks, according to Gilberto Fleitas, the head of criminal investigations at Paraguay's National Police. 
He estimated there are currently 500 PCC members in Paraguay's prisons, a figure that has doubled since last year thanks to the gang's aggressive recruiting. Fleitas' colleague, Ruben Paredes, believes that number to be even higher, and that around 10% of Paraguay's 16,000 prisoners belong to Brazilian gangs. Many more operate beyond the jailhouse walls, Paredes said, buying off lawmakers and corrupt police.
""At least in prison they're contained,"" said Paredes, investigations chief of the National Police in the densely populated region that includes Asunción. ""Outside, they do as they please.""
Dubbed the ""city of blood,"" Pedro Juan Caballero has proven a particularly alluring outpost for Brazil's drug gangs, authorities said. The city blends almost imperceptibly into the adjacent Brazilian municipality of Ponta Porã. Reuters saw no police checkpoints or barriers separating the two towns. People from both sides of the border cross with ease.
Small planes carrying Bolivian cocaine frequently touch down on remote landing strips outside Pedro Juan Caballero, Brazilian and Paraguayan authorities told Reuters. From there, they said, the drugs move through southern Brazil and on to Europe, where demand is booming.
The fallout can be seen in the rising body count in Pedro Juan Caballero as gangs battle to control trafficking routes, authorities said. Mayor Jose Carlos Acevedo said there were more than 150 homicides last year in the city of 120,000 people. He said residents live in fear of the gangs, who have made a mockery of the security apparatus.
""The police are completely corrupt,"" Acevedo said.
In a Jan. 30 editorial, Paraguay's most influential newspaper, ABC Color, bemoaned the atmosphere, alleging it is the ""golden dream"" of many cops to be transferred to Pedro Juan Caballero because of the ""illicit extra money"" they can earn aiding and abetting drug traffickers.
The city's police force, which does not report to Acevedo, did not respond to requests for comment.
CRIMINAL HISTORY
The criminal trajectory of da Cruz, the recaptured escapee, highlights Paraguay's challenge.
Born in an isolated village in northeastern Maranhão, Brazil's poorest state, da Cruz told police he moved to the western state of Mato Grosso when he was 10 years old.
In 2012, he went to jail for selling drugs, but was freed under a day-release program in 2015. He didn't hang around. Da Cruz said in his testimony that he fled across the border to Pedro Juan Caballero, where he was arrested on drug trafficking charges in 2016 and sent to the city's prison.
Once inside, he opted for PCC baptism and began handling administrative chores for the gang, he said in his testimony. 
Da Cruz was a low-ranking prisoner, according to a Brazilian cop who requested anonymity.
But prison brought him into contact with heavy hitters. More than a dozen of the PCC's top regional assassins lived in the cellblock alongside da Cruz, according to Fleitas, the criminal investigations chief. 
They, too, were among the escapees. But unlike da Cruz, who will likely spend the rest of his sentence in a Brazilian jail, they remain on the lam, police said.
The first intelligence reports about a possible prison break in Pedro Juan Caballero surfaced in mid-December.
Joaquín González Balsa, Paraguay's national prison director, in a Dec. 16 letter warned organized-crime investigators in Asunción that his agency had picked up chatter about a planned ""rescue of inmates from criminal groups"" at the lockup, according to a copy of that letter seen by Reuters. González Balsa was replaced after the escape. 
Pérez, the justice minister, said the prison's warden had come forward with similar information, leading them to believe him trustworthy. She said a subsequent sweep of the facility by prison guards and police officers in December turned up no signs of a tunnel. 
""One of the prisoners who was recaptured said they dug the tunnel after the search,"" she said. ""The company that monitors the security cameras didn't alert us to anything, because they say they didn't see anything."" 
Gustavo Sánchez, a representative of that security company, Asunción-based SIT, told Reuters it gave the Justice Ministry information relating to the night of the jailbreak. He declined to elaborate.
Pérez said Paraguay would step up cooperation with Brazil's right-wing government, which is trying to hobble the gangs by hitting their finances and sending bosses to high-security federal prisons. 
Fleitas, the Paraguayan criminal investigations chief, is dubious about the chances of success. 

""There's no way that anyone ... can stand up to this,"" he said. The gangs ""identify your family, they coerce your relatives, judges, prosecutors, police.""

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the region to discuss the issue with Beijing's neighbors who have so far refrained from any criticism of Chinese policies.
""We want to see Central Asia as a region of stable development, prosperity and cooperation, and we would really not like to feel on ourselves unfavorable political consequences in relation to some competition in our region between large powers,"" Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov said.
Pompeo's comments put the region's governments in an awkward position as they rely on China for much of their foreign trade and investment.
Speaking on a visit to the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, Pompeo said he would raise the Uighur issue with counterparts from all five ex-Soviet Central Asian nations - Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
""As I did in Kazakhstan yesterday, in my private meetings today I plan to discuss... the Chinese Communist Party's repression of Uighur Muslims, Kazakhs, and members of other minority groups in Xinjiang,"" Pompeo told a briefing.
On Sunday, Pompeo said Washington urged ""all countries to join us in pressing for an immediate end to this repression"" and provide safe refuge and asylum to those seeking to flee China.
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate between 1 million and 2 million people, mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions as part of what Beijing calls an anti-terrorism campaign.

MIAMI (Reuters) - The Kansas City Chiefs ended a 50-year Super Bowl drought with a dramatic 31-20 comeback win over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday in a breathtaking finish to the NFL's 100th season that may have also revealed a new star to kickoff the next century.
The Chiefs' young quarterback Patrick Mahomes stepped onto America's biggest sporting stage and produced an enthralling fourth-quarter rally that even the 49ers grudgingly applauded.
The 24-year-old's performance underscored why he is being called the heir apparent to six-time Super Bowl champion and future Hall of Famer Tom Brady of the Patriots.
With the Chiefs trailing 20-10, Mahomes engineered three scoring drives in just over five minutes, hitting Travis Kelce and Damien Williams (NYSE:WMB) with short touchdown passes to give Kansas City the lead.
Williams then raced 38 yards for the clinching score, sparking wild celebration for long-suffering Chiefs fans who had not seen their team hoist the Lombardi trophy since their victory over the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV.
If Chiefs supporters were over-the-moon about the long overdue Super Bowl win at Hard Rock Stadium they will be doubly excited about what the future might hold with Mahomes calling plays for years to come.
With an aging cast of quarterbacking greats marching towards retirement the NFL is searching for the new face of the league and after Sunday's display Mahomes looks to be the man.
Mahomes, who completed 26 of 42 attempts for 286 yards and threw two touchdown passes, appeared out of sorts for nearly three quarters of the game but took charge when it mattered to earn the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors.
He becomes the second-youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl and the youngest to claim both NFL and Super Bowl MVP awards.
CHIEFS DYNASTY?
But while Mahomes has been more than willing to take on the responsibilities as a team leader he is not quite as prepared to assume the job of the NFL's frontman.
""There's several guys that could be the face of the NFL,"" he said. ""Just how good the quarterback play is now, guys come in here year in and year out and play great football.
""Lamar (Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens) won the league MVP last night and he was a unanimous choice and had one of the best season of all-time at the quarterback position so there's guys like that it seems every year.
""A lot of young quarterbacks and still a lot of veteran guys are playing at a very high level.
""I'm just try to be the best Patrick Mahomes I can be and win football games.""
Very few quarterbacks, veterans or newcomers, have demonstrated the Houdini-like ability to escape defeat.
During the postseason, with Mahomes leading Kansas City's explosive attack, no lead has been safe.
In the divisional playoffs, the Chiefs fought back from 24-0 down to beat the Houston Texans and then erased a 10-0 Tennessee Titans advantage in the AFC championship.
The strong armed, charismatic leader has become a one-man highlight reel with his no0look passes and scrambling wizardry.
In just his second year as a starter, statistically few have been better.
Mahomes became only the second quarterback with 5,000 passing yards and 50 touchdowns in a single season.
With his outrageous skill, blue collar work ethic, and self-belief, the Chiefs could be on the cusp of a dynasty.
""We will enjoy this and then we come back next year it is going to be the same hard thing, the same amount of tenacity, dedication every single day,"" said Mahomes, looking forward to next season even as the champagne corks were popping on the current campaign.
""We're going to take it one day at a time, one year at a time and try to put together great years.
""Then at the end of it all we will have no regrets on where we are at.
""As long as we keep the people we have in this organization, on this team with the coach we have we have a chance to be good year in and year out but it is not going to be easy."""

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Shut out of the World Health Organization, Taiwan faces a dual problem in battling the threat of a new coronavirus: it is being included as a high-risk area as part of China but is unable to get epidemic information firsthand.
Taiwan is denied membership of most international bodies including the WHO, a U.N. agency, due to the objections of China, which considers the island a Chinese province with no right to participate unless it accepts it is part of China, something Taiwan's fiercely democratic government will not do.
Taiwan has long complained about China belittling it on the international stage and forcing foreign governments and companies to refer to it as part of China.
Now, with the virus biting, Taiwan says this policy means it has become collateral damage. It has only 10 coronavirus cases compared with more than 17,000 in China, but the WHO is lumping it together with China.
The consequences surfaced at the weekend when Taiwan said its largest airline, China Airlines (TW:2610), had been included in an Italian ban on flights from China because the WHO lists Taiwan under China, where the virus originated, as part of a high-risk area.
Bob Chen, the head of the Taiwan foreign ministry's Department of International Organisations, said it had complained repeatedly to the WHO.
""But to date, the WHO's secretariat's attitude has been very hard-line,"" he said on Sunday. ""It's very obvious that under China's pressure they can't show flexibility.""
However, the WHO, while still listing Taiwan as part of China, now refers to it as ""Taipei"", rather than ""Taiwan, China"" as it did in initial situation reports, Chen said.
""It's a small change, but from our perspective it's still far from enough. The biggest problem is they are still putting us under China.""
In a rare diplomatic success, Taiwan managed on Saturday to get Vietnam to lift its ban on flights to the island. China Airlines says its Rome flights remain suspended as Taiwan pressed Italy for them to be resumed.
Taiwan's other main airline,  Eva Airways  (TW:2618), which is due to start flights to Milan this month, said it had no information whether they would go ahead.
Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Taiwan's diplomats were working to ensure more countries do not stop flights from Taiwan.
Italy's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
'LIMITED' INFORMATION
China has denied seeking to make life difficult for Taiwan, saying it can get information from the WHO in a timely way.
""Taiwan compatriots are our own flesh and blood, and if they encounter difficulties overseas, we are willing to provide strong support,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday, responding to a question on Italy's flight ban.
But the WHO is for sovereign states and Taiwan can only take part under the ""one China"" principle, she added.
Procedures need to be changed as existing WHO channels provide only limited information, said Wang Liang-yu, Taiwan's de facto ambassador in Geneva, where the WHO is based. 
""The WHO should not hint that bilateral channels are enough to replace international cooperation,"" she told Reuters.
The WHO says it is collaborating closely with Taiwan through a 2005 legal instrument on health reporting requirements, the International Health Regulations. 
Taiwan experts were involved in all consultations on the coronavirus and the WHO ""had received vital information from Taiwanese authorities"", spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in an email to Reuters, without directly addressing the issue of Taiwan being listed as part of China.
Taiwan can't go to the emergency WHO meetings but has still been able to get coronavirus information, though has to wait for it to show up on WHO websites, said Chuang Jen-hsiang, deputy head of its Centres for Disease Control. 

""There is a time gap, but we can see it,"" he said.

The United Nations and World Health Organization will supervise patient transfers and flights from the capital, the sources said. They did not say where the flights were expected to land.
Yemen has been mired in almost five years of conflict since the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi from Sanaa in late 2014. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore Hadi.
Although the Houthis control Sanaa airport, access is restricted by the coalition, which controls the air space.
The United Nations has been trying to re-launch political negotiations to end the war. Separately, Riyadh has been holding informal talks with the Houthis since late September about de-escalation.
A diplomatic source said around 60 patients are expected to leave on flights this week.
Aid organization the Norwegian Refugee council said many more Yemenis were still waiting to get the healthcare they need.
“There is no justification for punishing very sick civilians by blocking them from accessing medical treatment.”"

Egyptian security forces have been battling an Islamist insurgency that is concentrated in North Sinai and escalated after 2013. Small scale attacks are common.
On Sunday, a group of gunmen detonated explosives on the pipeline west of el-Arish, causing a fire but no casualties, security sources and witnesses said.
The pipeline carries gas to homes and factories in el-Arish and central Sinai and has been attacked several times before, the sources said.
Egypt began importing gas from Israel last month through a pipeline owned by the East Mediterranean Gas Company (EMG), which includes an subsea connection between el-Arish in Sinai and Ashkelon in Israel.
The gas is imported from Israel's Leviathan field. Partners developing the field said in a statement that there had been no damage to the EMG pipeline.
""The flow of gas from Leviathan to Egypt is continuing as normal,"" the statement said."

The United States was the first nation to suggest partial withdrawal of its embassy staff, and the first to impose a ban on Chinese travelers, said ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying.
""All it has done could only create and spread fear, which is a bad example,"" Hua told an online news briefing, adding that China hoped countries would make judgements and responses that were reasonable, calm and based on science.
The United States began evacuating U.S. citizens from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have first emerged late last year, on Jan. 28.
The World Health Organization on Jan. 30 declared the accelerating outbreak a global emergency. On the same day, the U.S. State Department raised its travel advisory for China.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 02:32AM ET</span>",Hong Kong medical workers strike to urge closure of China border to block virus,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hundreds of medical workers went on strike in Hong Kong on Monday to demand the government shuts the border with mainland China to prevent the spread of a coronavirus and ease pressure on a stretched health sector.
The Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA), which has about 18,000 members, said 2,400 workers took part in the strike, despite calls by the government for medical workers not to.
Hong Kong has 15 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, which emerged in central China in December and has killed more than 360 people there and sent jitters through global markets. 
""(We) hope that these strikes will make the government respond to our five demands, most importantly to stop the spread of the coronavirus in Hong Kong,"" said medical worker Tracy Pui, who queued up with colleagues to sign a petition in support of the HAEA.
The demands are for the government to close the border with the mainland, facilitate the distribution of masks to the public, ensure that front-line medical workers have adequate supplies and protection, provide enough isolation wards for patients, and guarantee no reprisals for striking medical staff. 
About 100 people rallied in the heart of Hong Kong's financial district in support of the health workers' union, with some holding banners saying: ""Close Borders, Contain Epidemics.""
The scare over the virus comes after months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, triggered by what many residents see as unnecessary interference by Beijing in city affairs.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has suspended high-speed rail services to the mainland and cross-border ferries, but she has stopped short of closing the entire border, saying it would be ""inappropriate and impractical"".
Panic-stricken residents have emptied shelves in major supermarkets in Hong Kong, stockpiling meat, rice and cleaning products as fears escalate over the coronavirus.
About 90 percent of the city's food is imported, with the bulk coming from the mainland, according to official data.
The coronavirus is expected to pile pressure on the city's economy, which sank into recession in the third quarter as the often violent protests scared away tourists and took a heavy toll on retailers. 
Toy shop owner Lam Wa-yin, 45, said closing the border would intensify worries about supplies of staples.
""They've started rushing to buy supplies even before they fully close the borders,"" Lam said.
""It'll get worse if it is fully closed. Especially food, people have been rushing to buy oil, salt and rice, not to mention the face masks.""

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 02:01AM ET</span>","Obituary: Bernard Ebbers, convicted of orchestrating WorldCom fraud, dead at 78","Bernard Ebbers, who built WorldCom Inc into a telecommunications giant and was convicted in one of the largest U.S. accounting scandals, died on Sunday, his family said in a statement. He was 78.
His health had been rapidly deteriorating before a federal judge granted him a compassionate release from prison in December 2019, after he had served a little over 13 years of a 25-year sentence.
""He was hospitalized multiple times in November and December, yet there was still no diagnosis or proactive treatment plan"", his son Joy Ebbers Bourne, said in the statement.
Known as Bernie, the bearded, twice-divorced Ebbers spent nearly two decades transforming a small Mississippi company once known as Long Distance Discount Service into WorldCom through a slew of acquisitions, including the $37 billion takeover of the much larger MCI Communications in 1998.
That made Ebbers' company a rival for AT&T, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and other long-distance carriers, and made Ebbers a billionaire.
But it crashed down in 2002 in an $11 billion accounting fraud, where former employees said Ebbers had urged them to inflate WorldCom's financial results to make the company more profitable and please Wall Street analysts.
Ebbers was convicted by a Manhattan jury in March 2005 for orchestrating the fraud, and was found guilty of securities fraud, conspiracy and other crimes.
His punishment was more severe than those imposed on two other chief executives from big corporate scandals in the same period, a 24-year prison term for Enron's Jeffrey Skilling and a 15-year term for Adelphia Communications' John Rigas. Skilling's term was later shortened, and he and Rigas have been released.
Ebbers denied he was at fault, saying it was subordinates who had concealed WorldCom's skyrocketing costs.
He thought himself less a micromanager, and more the high school basketball coach he once was.
""I'm not an engineer by training; I'm not an accountant by training - all those types of specialized skills,"" he told the New York Times in 1998, which interviewed him on his 130-foot yacht, Countach.
""My job is to bring people in who do have those specific skills and then rely on them. I'm the coach. I'm not the point guard who shoots the ball.""
WorldCom had about $103.8 billion of assets when it filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in July 2002, making its bankruptcy the largest in U.S. corporate history.
That title is now held by Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in 2008. CNBC and Portfolio.com in 2013 named Ebbers the fifth-worst American CEO of all time. Lehman's Richard Fuld ranked first.
GOING TO CHURCH WITH A CROOK
Bernard John Ebbers was born on Aug. 27, 1941 in Edmonton, Alberta. He later moved to California and New Mexico, and then back to Canada, before obtaining a physical education degree in 1967 from Mississippi College, where the 6-foot-4 (1.93 m) Ebbers had a basketball scholarship.
Ebbers became a businessman, and had amassed a small chain of motels by 1983, when he and other entrepreneurs came up with the idea for LDDS.
He became CEO two years later, and it changed its name to WorldCom in 1995. The name changed to MCI WorldCom after the MCI purchase, and later back to WorldCom.
Ebbers remained on the prowl, announcing a $129 billion merger with Sprint Corp in October 1999, only to have regulators block that tie-up.
But as the global technology and telecommunications bubble began to burst, Ebbers became financially strained from margin calls, leading him to borrow heavily from WorldCom.
He was ousted in April 2002 amid unhappiness over more than $400 million he reportedly owed. Two months later, WorldCom revealed an accounting shortfall and said it would restate some results. The chief financial officer was fired.
With his former company on the brink, Ebbers reportedly appeared on June 30, 2002 at the Easthaven Baptist Church in Brookhaven, Mississippi, where he attended services and taught Sunday school.
He reportedly told the congregation that no one would find he had knowingly committed fraud, and assured that ""you aren't going to church with a crook.""
Testifying in his own defense at his trial, a relatively rare move in a high-profile white-collar case, Ebbers invoked his coaching past to describe his management style.
""I considered myself demanding,"" he said. ""I expected results. I sometimes said things I shouldn't have said maybe.""
But he maintained ignorance of details. ""I don't know about technology and I don't know about finance and accounting,"" he said, according to The New York Times.
Jurors thought otherwise.
NO SLAP ON WRIST
Ebbers' health began deteriorating rapidly in late 2019, not long after he sought early release from prison under a federal law allowing some older prisons to obtain freedom sooner.
According to court papers, he had become legally blind, had fallen several times, was easily disoriented, and needed help to walk, eat and groom himself. His cognitive skills had slid well below the level suggesting dementia. Ebbers' weight fell to 142 pounds (64 kg) in December 2019 from 200 pounds (91 kg) in July 2018.
Even Barbara Jones, the federal judge who imposed Ebbers' prison sentence, thought early release was appropriate.
U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni, who took over the case after Jones entered private practice, concluded that society had no reason to fear Ebbers would resume ""fashioning fraudulent securities schemes"" or pose any threat if he were released.
""Thirteen years of incarceration--up to the point of approaching death--is not a slap on the wrist,"" Caproni wrote in
January 2020. ""Ebbers has essentially served the life sentence
that the sentencing court predicted it had imposed."""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison will on Tuesday front parliament for the first time in three months as he seeks to repair his standing with voters angry by his response to the country's bushfire crisis and a scandal over sports funding.
Morrison secured re-election in May 2019, defying polls that had indicated voters would punish his conservative government for ousting its former leader Malcolm Turnbull in 2018.
Less than nine months after what he described as his ""miracle"" re-election, Morrison is now unpopular with voters and under pressure from opposition Labor lawmakers.
""The Labor party will be like a mosquito on a nudist beach, they are so many fleshy issues for them to bite into,"" said John Hewson, former leader of the Liberal Party, now headed by Morrison.
""They will go after him on issues of climate and he's defense of the sports funding. He will be under huge pressure.""
A Newspoll for The Australian newspaper on Monday showed Morrison's approval rating was at its lowest level since he assumed office, while his government is trailing the Labor party by a margin of 52% to 48%.
While Morrison can not be ousted as party leader after changes to Liberal party rules following Turnbull's fall, he will not want poor polling to impact his legislative agenda before the next election that must be held before 2022.
Morrison came under fire from voters in December when it was revealed he was on a family holiday in Hawaii as the country's bushfire crisis escalated.
When two fire fighters were killed, forcing him to return, his initial inaction and later refusal to link the fires with climate change drew criticism that he lacked leadership at a time of national crisis.
The prolonged bushfire season has killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals since September. About 2,500 homes have been destroyed and more than 11.7 million hectares of tinder-dry bushland have been razed.
Public anger at Morrison and his government has also been fueled by an independent audit of public spending which found the government used a A$100 million ($68.4 million) sport development fund to target votes in marginal electorates ahead of the last election.
The Australian National Audit Office said 400 projects received funding, with more than 70% done without any endorsement by the governing body for sport in Australia.
When the report was first released Morrison refused to discipline the former sports minister who approved the funding, drawing more voter criticism.
Bridget McKenzie, the deputy leader of the Nationals - the junior member of Morrison's conservative coalition - on Sunday resigned after she was ruled to have breached ministerial rules when as sports minister she approved a A$36,000 grant for a shooting club where she was a member.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Nine years after a devastating crash in property prices catapulted the party of Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar to power, a housing market recovery too rapid for many threatens to dump it into opposition at this week's general election. 
The property recovery under Varadkar's center-right Fine Gael party helped lay the foundation for Ireland's transformation from bailed-out basket case in 2010 to the fastest growing economy in Europe for the past five years. 
But the boom has left a generation struggling to afford rents that are higher on average in the capital Dublin than Tokyo, Sydney or Singapore while house prices have surged 86% in seven years.
A scarcity of housing has become the defining issue of the campaign, with daily stories of low-income families stuck in temporary accommodation such as hotels waiting for social housing and workers in their 30s living with their parents.
In every opinion poll so far, Varadkar's Fine Gael has trailed fellow center-right party Fianna Fáil, its main rival long vilified for being in charge during the bust a decade ago.
At the weekend, Fine Gael fell into third place for the first time, behind Irish nationalists Sinn Fein, the country's largest left-wing party, which has built its campaign around housing. 
""I have never felt before such a movement of anger towards the government,"" said Mary McCormack, a 61-year-old homeowner, whose 34-year-old son is living at home and considering emigration as the only option to save a deposit to buy a house. 
""He's got a good wage, he saves his money but he can't afford to step onto that ladder. A man that age should have his own place,"" said McCormack, who plans to vote for Sinn Fein.
HOUSEBUILDING COLLAPSE
Mortgage-holders bore the brunt of Ireland's property crash in 2008, when house prices more than halved. That led to all Irish banks but one being nationalized and an international bailout - followed by Fine Gael's election victory in 2011.
A collapse in housebuilding since has helped lift property prices to just 17% below their peak - easing the plight of homeowners and the largely state-owned banks who lent to them. 
But the lack of supply has hammered renters, who are paying 40% more than at the height the Celtic Tiger boom, according to property website Daft.ie. Average rents in Dublin are now nearly 1,800 euros ($2,000) a month, almost double 2011 levels. 
Almost 10,000 people are living in emergency accommodation and considered homeless, according to government data.
""There's no doubt the lack of available rental accommodation has become a real burning election issue,"" said Sinn Fein housing spokesman Eoin O Broin.
While all parties agree rents need to stop rising and house-building needs to increase, they are divided on how much the state should intervene in the private market. 
The government has established ""rent pressure zones"", where increases in rents are capped at 4% a year, but other parties are calling for a rent freeze and a ban on evictions. 
While Fine Gael has put in place programs to help young people buy their first home and to reduce the cost of building, they have shied away from the mass state-funded construction of social housing advocated by left-wing rivals. 
Fine Gael argues that opposition promises are unrealistic and some could push private investment out of the market.
""Don't take advantage of the genuine anxieties those who are renting have, don't take advantage of the concerns that young people have about their ability to buy homes in the future by putting forward plans that we might not be able to deliver,"" Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told Reuters.
LACK OF TRUST
Fine Gael's attempts to refocus the campaign away from housing to the booming economy and the government's success, so far, in preventing Brexit creating a hard border on the island of Ireland, have foundered.
Just 3% of potential voters identified Britain's departure from the European Union as the key issue in a poll last month while housing and health were cited by almost three out of four.
Another poll found only 12% thought Fine Gael was best equipped to manage the housing and rental crisis, about half the level of its main rivals.
On one of the first days of campaigning, headlines were dominated by a homeless man being badly injured when Dublin city workers cleared away the tent he was sleeping in - right by a poster of Fine Gael's housing minister.
Housing charity Focus Ireland, which last week opened a center for the country's record number of homeless families to wash clothes and get something to eat, has been critical. 
""There are a large number of families who have never experienced homelessness before who say I can't believe that this has happened to me. They're completely unprepared for it,"" said Mike Allen, director of advocacy at the charity. 
While the government cannot be accused of doing nothing, ""they have not done nearly enough to recognize how very, very deep rooted this problem is"", Allen said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Panic-stricken residents have emptied shelves in major supermarkets in Hong Kong, stockpiling meat, rice, cleaning products and soap as fears escalate over a coronavirus epidemic on the mainland.
The rush to procure food in the city of 7.4 million people is unprecedented, residents say, describing it as far worse than the panic during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that killed nearly 800 people around the world, including nearly 300 in Hong Kong.
The new coronavirus originated in central China's Hubei province and has so far killed 361 people in the country.
Over the weekend in Hong Kong, hundreds of people queued for hours to buy masks and immune-boosting products such as vitamin C.
At a major supermarket in the bustling Wan Chai district, counters selling chilled meat and seafood were empty by mid-morning on Friday and over the weekend, with stocks of fresh vegetables dwindling.
""Everybody is really worried. I think everyone is afraid of what is going to happen in the next few days. Prices are also going to rise,"" said Cindy, a retail executive who was buying dry food and soap.
Dozens of mask-wearing shoppers pushed trolleys down empty aisles showing sold-out signs for hand wash and antiseptic liquids. Others tried to stock up on remaining bags of rice and packaged noodles.
The rush to buy food and cleaning products comes as some shoppers said they were concerned that a potential shutdown of the border would impact the supply of products.
Around 90 percent of the city's total food supply is imported, with the bulk coming from the mainland, according to official data.
The Hong Kong government has closed some border crossings, including the high-speed rail, but has stopped short of a complete shutdown, despite growing calls from medical workers, who plan a strike on Monday to demand action.
The government is grappling with how to handle spreading infections locally, with 15 confirmed cases in the city. Calls have grown for the government to close the border with mainland China to minimize the risk of infection.
Hong Kong's economy was badly hit during the SARS epidemic with tourism and services sectors the most affected as visitor arrivals tumbled and unemployment spiraled.
There was also a severe drop in consumer spending in the second quarter of 2003 due to SARS but a pick up for the rest of the year saw retail sales drop only 0.6 percent on the year
Last week, at an upmarket supermarket in Kowloon's Elements mall, chilled produce was sold out most afternoons while at Britain's Marks & Spencer, chicken was sold out by midday.
At local wet markets, which are typically packed with local residents, many stalls were shuttered as residents opted to shop in air-conditioned grocery stores, believing they were safer.
""It is worrying that food is being stockpiled but what is even scarier is the stockpiling of masks and sanitizers,"" said a man who would only go by his first name, Nelson, who was shopping with his wife.
So frantic is the search for masks that police on Friday said a 56-year-old medical worker was in custody for stealing 36 face masks and gloves from a hospital where she worked."

While a fire continued to burn out of control southwest of Canberra, warnings were downgraded to ""advice"" for people in the area, with no properties under threat.
Around a quarter of the land in the Australian Capital Territory, home to Canberra, has been hit by wildfires over the past few weeks, fueled by hot and windy conditions. Temperatures fell on Monday to around 28 degrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit).
""A change in wind direction is expected to bring heavy smoke over urban areas of Canberra,"" the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Emergency Services said on its web site.
Firefighters in New South Wales were battling blazes in the state's southeast, where seven homes were destroyed over the weekend, the NSW Rural Fire Service said. Conditions eased on Monday with showers and cooler temperatures.
Australia's prolonged bushfire season has killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals since September. About 2,500 homes have been destroyed and more than 11.7 million hectares (45,175 square miles) of tinder-dry bushland have been razed.
The fire crisis led 274 scientists to urge the Australian government, which has refused to raise targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, to take more drastic action and move toward net zero emissions by 2050.
""Australia's dangerous fire-weather is virtually certain to worsen in the future with ongoing human-induced climate change, making fire management increasingly challenging,"" the climate and fire experts from all over the world said in an open letter.
The fires have also damaged thousands of kilometers of power lines, destroyed more than 5,000 power poles and cut power to 80,000 homes, industry group Energy Networks Australia said on Monday.
""The devastation has been unprecedented,"" it said."

A state of emergency has been declared and 382 people were trapped in the Fiordland region, including visitors and staff at a lodge and on tourist boats, the region's emergency management controller Angus McKay said in a statement.
""They have plenty of food and are safe and warm,"" said McKay, adding that most would likely stay for at least the next day in Milford Sound, which has suffered severe flooding after heavy rain in the last 24 hours.

Amman, 20, was named by British police as the attacker who stabbed two people before he was shot dead by armed officers who had been carrying out surveillance on him.
In November 2018 he pleaded guilty to possession of terrorist documents and disseminating terrorist publications, and the following month he was sentenced to more than three years in prison.
He was 17 and living at home with his mother and younger siblings when he first began committing terrorism offenses, according to authorities. Police became aware of his activities in April 2018 and he was arrested by armed officers in a north London street a month later.
When officers examined his computers and phone, they found he had downloaded material about making explosives and carrying out terrorist attacks, according to police. 
Messages showed that he had discussed with his family, friends and girlfriend his extreme views and desire to carry out an attack, often focused on using a knife, police said.
In December 2017 Amman posted a picture of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was killed during a U.S. raid in Syria in October, and told his brother in a message that ""the Islamic State is here to stay.""
He also described Yazidi women as slaves and said the Koran made it permissible to rape them, and in another message he encouraged his girlfriend to behead her parents.

Police said he had shared an online al-Qaeda magazine with his family and while in a discussion about school with a sibling he wrote he would ""rather blow myself up"".

Lai, who assumes office in May, has angered China by saying he is a ""realistic worker for Taiwan independence"", a red line for Beijing which considers the island merely a Chinese province with no right to state-to-state relations.
Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
Lai wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that he was going in an individual capacity.
The National Prayer Breakfast, which was started in 1953, takes place from Feb. 5-6 and is hosted by members of the U.S. Congress.
Lai added he would also express his thanks to U.S. politicians who have supported Taiwan's bid to enter the World Health Organization (WHO).
Taiwan is excluded from the WHO - as it is most international bodies - due to objections from China, which says the island can only participate if it recognizes itself as part of China, something Taiwan's government has refused to do.
Taiwan and the United States do not have formal diplomatic ties, but Washington is Taipei's most important international backer and main supplier of arms.
Taipei and Washington have further strengthened ties under the Trump administration, to China's anger, which regularly says Taiwan is the single most sensitive issue in Sino-U.S. relations."

TAUCHE, Germany (Reuters) - The German state of Brandenburg has erected about 120 km (75 miles) of electric fencing to prevent wild boars infected with African swine fever (ASF) from straying across the border from Poland and infecting its pig herd.
Hans-Christian Daniels doesn't think the barrier will work.
""It looks rather inevitable that swine fever will come,"" said Daniels, whose farm near Tauche, close to the Polish border, has 11,000 pigs. ""This could cause a dramatic fall in prices.""
ASF, which has led to the deaths of a quarter of the world's pigs in China and roiled the global meat industry, is dangerously close to Germany, Europe's largest pork producer.
A case of the viral disease was discovered in a wild boar in Poland just 12 km from the German border last month.
A confirmed case in Germany could prompt an import ban, ending the boom times for local pig farmers, who have seen exports to China, the world's biggest consumer of pork, jump due to outbreaks of ASF in Asia. It could also have knock-on effects in the Netherlands and Denmark, where the main suppliers of piglets for Germany are based.
Farmers such as Daniels have taken strict steps to ward off the disease but the biggest risk factor is from wild boars that roam the fields and forests along the German-Polish border feeding on nuts and acorns. They have already helped infect around 10 countries in eastern Europe, with Poland recording 55 outbreaks of ASF in wild boars in December alone.
""We do not know exactly how many wild boar we have in Brandenburg but their numbers have been increasing in recent years,"" said Anja Semmele of the Brandenburg hunting association. ""Our region is something of a paradise for wild boar, with a mix of forests and farming.""
""They run very quickly and hunters need a good level of marksmanship to hit and kill the animal humanely.""
POTENTIALLY LARGE LOSSES
ASF is a highly contagious viral disease that kills almost all the pigs it infects but does not harm humans. It has been spreading across eastern Europe but is doing the greatest damage in Asia and has devastated pig farms in China in the past year, reshaping global meat trade and raising prices.
China's pork output has slumped to a 16-year low as herds were culled to stamp out the disease, leading to a surge in imports of pork, beef and chicken to fill the gap. [nL4N29M0NH]
Germany's pork exports to China rose 43% year-on-year in the first seven months of 2019 and it was Germany's single biggest foreign market.
Asian countries, including China, regularly impose import bans on pork from regions where ASF has been discovered and German pig farmers could face huge losses from both the drop in exports and costs arising from methods to combat the disease if it is found in Germany, said farmers' association DBV.
""It is difficult to estimate how high the damage will be for German pig farmers,"" said DBV Secretary General Bernhard Kruesken. ""But we estimate at least a triple-digit million euro sum.""
Any export ban on German pork would also have knock-on effects for other European countries.
“The main suppliers of piglets for Germany in the EU are Denmark and the Netherlands. That means there will be effects in the Dutch and Danish markets quite immediately,"" said Thomas Sanchez, a policy advisor with responsibility for pigmeat at EU farmers group, Copa Cogeca.
To help deal with the threat of ASF, German and Polish agriculture ministries are considering creating a fenced corridor on both sides of their border and a ""drastic"" reduction in wild boar numbers by relaxing rules on shooting them. [nL8N29Q2NF]
The Brandenburg fence was built in December and is designed to be temporary. Another fence is being built in the border state of Saxony.
""We have found no signs that the fence has been broken through by wild boars and no sick boars have been found along the fence,"" said Gabriel Hesse of Brandenburg's state health and consumer protection ministry.
""There are hopes that the fence is effective, but these animals are remarkably strong."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has taken decisive action to protect Americans from the threat of a fast-moving coronavirus while offering help to China, President Donald Trump said on Sunday, but a key adviser said Beijing had not accepted the offers of assistance.
Trump appeared to downplay concerns about the impact in the United States of the flu-like virus that has killed 350 people in China and spread to more than two dozen countries, telling Fox television in an interview, ""We're gonna see what happens, but we did shut it down, yes.""
Concerns about the virus spurred the United States to declare a public health emergency and bar entry to foreign nationals who have recently visited China.
Under new restrictions https://www.dhs.gov/publication/notice-arrival-restrictions-applicable-flights-carrying-persons-who-have-recently that went into effect at 5 p.m. ET Sunday, U.S. citizens who have traveled in China within 14 days will be directed to one of eight airports designated for screening, with three more to be added Monday.
""We can't have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem - the coronavirus,"" Trump told Fox during a short interview broadcast on Sunday. He said U.S. officials had offered China ""tremendous help"" in dealing with the epidemic.
Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, in a separate interview, said China had been more open about the coronavirus than it has been in previous crises but had not yet accepted U.S. offers of assistance.
""So far the Chinese have been more transparent certainly than in past crises and we appreciate that,"" O'Brien said in an interview with CBS's ""Face the Nation.""
He said Beijing has still not responded to U.S. offers of help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health professionals.
""We've got tremendous expertise,"" he said. ""This is a worldwide concern. We want to help our Chinese colleagues if we can and we've made the offer and we'll see if they accept the offer.""
The Group of Seven leading industrialized democracies are seeking a unified procedure to tackle the fast-spreading coronavirus, and will hold a conference on the virus, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Sunday, after speaking with U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar. Azar's office had no immediate comment.
In addition to Germany and the United States, the G7 includes France, Italy, Japan, Canada and Britain.
CDC officials have not been invited into China, but are in neighboring Kazakhstan to help guard against the spread of the virus, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday during a visit there.
""You’ve got a long border with China which is where this disease has emanated from,"" Pompeo said in an interview with a Kazakh journalist. ""And we’ve got our people from the Center for Disease Control right here on the ground, helping Kazakhstan deal with this so that you don’t have an enormous outbreak.""
The local health commission in China's Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, reported 56 new deaths on Sunday, bringing the total to 350.
At least 171 cases have been reported in more than two dozen other countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Britain.
A ninth case of the fast-spreading virus was confirmed in the United States on Sunday, in Santa Clara, in the San Francisco Bay area, health officials said. The Pentagon is providing housing for people arriving from overseas who might need to be quarantined.
Americans who visited China's Hubei Province, epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic, will be subject to a mandatory quarantine of 14 days - the incubation period of the virus - upon entering the United States. Americans who traveled to other parts of mainland China will undergo health screening and be asked to self-quarantine for up to 14 days.
Foreigners who have traveled in China within 14 days of their arrival will be denied entry.
Chad Wolf, U.S. Homeland Security acting secretary, said the overall risk to the American public remains low.
The coronavirus is believed to have originated in a market that traded illegally in wildlife in Hubei's provincial capital, Wuhan."

LONDON (Reuters) - First World War drama ""1917"" was the big winner at the BAFTAs on Sunday, picking up seven awards including best picture and director for Sam Mendes, at a glittering ceremony in London that made headlines for a glaring lack of diversity among nominees.
The thrilling drama, shot in what appears to be a single take, was also honored in the outstanding British film, sound, production design, cinematography and special visual effects categories.
Britain's top movie awards have been criticized for having all-white shortlists in its acting categories and an all-male one for director, triggering the use of the hashtag #BaftasSoWhite on social media. 
BAFTA boss Amanda Berry had said she was ""very disappointed"" by the lack of diversity.
Joaquin Phoenix voted best actor for his critically acclaimed transformation from vulnerable loner into confident villain in ""Joker"", addressed the issue head on in his acceptance speech. 
The industry was sending a ""a very clear message to people of color that you're not welcome here"", he said, adding it ""was on us"" to dismantle a system of oppression.
Award presenter Rebel Wilson drew the biggest laughs and cheers of the evening when, after reading out the all-male best director list, said: ""I don't think I could do what they do, honestly I just don't have the balls.""
Actress Scarlett Johansson, who missed out in the leading and supporting actress categories, told Reuters the all-male directing shortlist showed women were being held back and the industry had to be mindful of the issue. 
""It's pretty disappointing, especially because there were so many great films this year that happened to be directed by women,"" she said. 
It was a frustrating evening for Netflix's ""The Irishman"", Martin Scorsese's star-studded gangster drama, which was nominated in 10 categories but left empty handed.
The streaming giant, however, fared better with divorce drama ""Marriage Story"", which saw Laura Dern win best supporting actress. 
Brad Pitt picked up best supporting actor for Quentin Tarantino's ""Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood"", the only success for a movie nominated for 10 awards.

Bong Joon Ho's darkly comic film ""Parasite"" triumphed in the original screenplay and film not in the English language categories at the ceremony at London's Royal Albert Hall.

1610,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2020 06:13PM ET</span>","Ahead of polls, New Zealand's opposition party rules out deal with kingmaker Peters","By Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's opposition party has ruled out a post-election deal with the party of Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, setting the stage for a close contest at the polls this year as both major parties may struggle to form a government.
Peters, a seasoned politician and leader of New Zealand First party, has often played the role of kingmaker in the country's German-style proportional representation electoral system.
He sided with Jacinda Ardern's Labour Party in the 2017 polls allowing her to unexpectedly form a center-left coalition government with NZ First and the Green Party.
Prime Minister Ardern has announced elections will be on Sept. 19, and kicked off a lengthy election campaign last week with promises of massive infrastructure spending.
The main center-right opposition National Party leader Simon Bridges said late on Sunday that he could not trust Peters, and New Zealand voters should have a clear choice about what they are getting when they go to the ballot box.
""A vote for NZ First is a vote for Labour and the Greens,"" Bridges said.
""I don't believe we can work with NZ First and have a constructive trusting relationship,"" he added.
The move weakens Peters' NZ First party, which is the only center party in parliament, and has been the only party with the ability to work with either the left bloc or right bloc, analysts said.
""This is likely to have a negative impact on NZ First's popularity, because they are now going to be less relevant. They now look less powerful, as they no longer have leverage or the potential to negotiate with both blocs,"" said political commentator Bryce Edwards of Victoria University in Wellington.
The National Party is hoping the move will weaken the Labour-led coalition and help it secure the votes of conservative NZ First supporters, Edwards added.
But National would also need to get as close to a majority as possible to secure a win, as it only has the small, libertarian ACT Party as a possible coalition partner.
Opinion polls last November showed National had 46% support, Labour had 39%, Greens had 7% and NZ first had just 4%. A political party has to win 5% of the votes or an electoral seat to get into parliament.
""Simon Bridges has just made it quite clear that he still has a lot to learn about politics,"" Peters said in a statement on Twitter in response to National's decision.
The election is a test for Ardern, who is hugely popular among liberal voters overseas thanks to her decisive response to the March 2019 mass shooting in Christchurch, her focus on climate change action and multilateralism, and her ability to combine motherhood and leadership.
But her popularity at home has been affected by slowing economic growth and low business confidence."

MIAMI (Reuters) - After a night of living up to its party reputation Miami was looking for more on Sunday as the final countdown to the Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chief and San Francisco 49ers began under a blanket of security and protests.
More than eight hours before 1830 ET kickoff, fans, some who had paid over $5,000 for a ticket, made their way through miles of bumper-to-bumper traffic, protests by local residents and airport type security before settling into their seats at Hard Rock Stadium.
""We just bought our tickets this morning and came,"" said Shon Yust, a lifelong Chiefs fan from Kansas City not saying what he paid. ""The prices were slightly lower but not substantially.
""I’m 51, going to be 52, the last time they were in the Super Bowl, I was two. So, we’re like, ‘We better go’.”
The sky-high prices and challenges have done little to spoil the party as the NFL returned to its favorite Super Bowl city for a record 11th time.
Chiefs and Niners supporters decked out in team jerseys along with A-listers and celebrities warmed up for America's biggest sporting event, which will be watched by a global television audience, by turning South Beach into one big party on Saturday night.
From the Sports Illustrated bash at the iconic Fountainbleau Hotel to Budweiser's BUDX Hotel event at the other end of Collins Ave., South Beach was turned into one big blowout.
Away from the downtown core Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM) and Lady Gaga anchored the party scene as celebrations raged into the small hours of the morning.
More than 400 private jets, twice the usual number for a weekend, were reported to have clogged up local airports depositing their cargo of high rollers.
Included among those was Air Force One with President Donald Trump spending the weekend at his nearby Mar-a-Lago golf club.
Not everyone was excited about the Super Bowl being back in Miami.
Residents of Miami Gardens, the mostly black, working class area surrounding the stadium, have long felt neglected and even exploited by the Miami Dolphins organization and expressed their unhappiness with about 100 people staging a protest.
They say their quality of life has suffered from the region’s eternal quest for tourism dollars, and fear the area’s black community faces a new chapter in a history of displacement.
Instead of joining millions of Americans celebrating this weekend’s game, protesters took to the streets outside the venue on Sunday to express their frustration."

WARSAW (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron visits Poland on Monday and Tuesday in an effort to reset frosty ties at a time when the departure of Britain from the European Union is reshaping political alliances in the 27-member bloc.
Arriving in Warsaw days after Brexit, Macron is signaling the importance of one of the EU's biggest members, despite a relationship marked by clashes over issues ranging from climate change policy, NATO and Poland's adherence to the rule of law.
In an attempt to strengthen ties, he will propose new investment plans and try to build nuclear and military partnerships during the visit, French and Polish officials said.
""Perhaps we won't be best friends right away but we can gradually rebuild working relations,"" a Polish official close to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told Reuters.
Relations between Poland and France soured after Poland's Law and Justice (PiS) government scrapped a $3.4 billion helicopter deal with Airbus in 2016, angering France, which thought the deal was largely agreed.
Since then, France and Poland have been on the opposite sides of many arguments.
Macron, a fervent European integrationist, has decried nationalist governments like Poland's and criticized, along with the EU executive, efforts by PiS to put Polish courts and media under more government control.
Both countries want to keep generous funding for their agricultural sectors in the EU budget, but Paris is pushing for more action on migration and the climate, while Warsaw has rejected EU policies on both matters.
Political experts say, however, that Macron may be keen to test new alliances in Europe amid tensions with Germany, another EU powerhouse, over European reforms.
France and Germany have been at loggerheads over the past year as Macron's ambitious plans for reform have often run into resistance from the more cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel.
""Paris is looking for another partner to work on the future of Europe. Berlin is not delivering,"" said Michal Baranowski, director of political think tank the German Marshall Fund in Warsaw.
The PiS government has called for a reversal of some EU powers, wanting more say for national parliaments. But Poland's ties with Germany have also suffered during its rule, with PiS saying Berlin owed it money for World War Two damage.
Macron visits Poland at a time of heightened tensions over the PiS government's judiciary reforms, which EU critics have said undermine the bloc's democratic standards.
Last month, parliament passed a law that allows for disciplining judges critical of government changes to the judiciary. The European Commission has asked the EU's highest court to freeze it."

LONDON (Reuters) - Police shot dead a man who stabbed two people on a busy street in south London on Sunday in what officials described as a terrorist incident believed to be related to Islamist militancy.
Police said in a statement that a hoax device was found strapped to the body of the man killed by armed officers. 
One man was being treated for life-threatening injuries after being stabbed, a woman suffered less serious wounds and another woman was hurt by glass after an officer fired his weapon, the statement from London's Metropolitan Police said.
Some witnesses said the man had been armed with a machete and one said he was wearing silver canisters on his chest.
Footage filmed on the high street in the Streatham district of south London showed two men in plain clothes - one in a hoodie and one with a police baseball cap - pointing their guns at a body on the pavement nearby.
""The incident was quickly declared as a terrorist incident and we believe it to be Islamist-related,"" said Lucy D'Orsi, deputy assistance commissioner in the Metropolitan Police.
Police said the situation had been contained.
Chris Wells was in a shop in Streatham with his daughter when they heard three gunshots outside. 
""People just came running in screaming and upset, shouting about a gun. We ran to the back of the shop and were locked in,"" he told Reuters.
""We tried to leave to get away and I saw a man in a hoodie with a gun, which I now know was a plain clothes officer,"" he said. ""And another officer shouted at us to get back inside because there was a bomb threat.""
'THREE GUNSHOTS'
Sky News said it understood that the man shot dead was ""under active police surveillance"" and had been released from prison in January.
""An investigation is taking place at pace to establish the full facts of what happened,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement. He said his government would announce plans on Monday for making changes to the system for handling people convicted of terrorism offences.
Sky quoted Gulled Bulhan, a 19-year-old student from Streatham, as saying he witnessed the shooting.
""I was crossing the road when I saw a man with a machete and silver canisters on his chest being chased by what I assume was an undercover police officer - as they were in civilian clothing,"" Bulhan said.
""The man was then shot. I think I heard three gunshots but I can't quite remember.""
The last such incident in London was in November, when police shot dead a man wearing a fake suicide vest who stabbed two people to death and wounded three more before being wrestled to the ground by bystanders.
That attack, at London Bridge, was carried out by a man with Islamist militant sympathies. He had been jailed for terrorism and released early.

The airliner was struck by a missile on Jan. 8 shortly after it left Tehran en route to Kiev. Iran admitted its forces had shot down the Ukraine International Airlines plane in error, after initially denying it had a role in the incident. All 176 people aboard, including 11 Ukrainians, were killed.
Zelenskiy also said that Ukraine still was waiting for Iran to hand over the black boxes of the plane."

Roland Marchal is a senior researcher at the Sciences Po university in Paris and Fariba Adelkhah, a Franco-Iranian dual national, is also an academic there.
Authorities have dropped spying charges against Adelkhah but are still holding her on other security-related charges, her lawyer said on Jan. 7. He said Marshal was being held on suspicion of acting against Iranian national security.
""We consider these detentions intolerable. We have made this known to the highest authorities, including President (Hassan) Rouhani,"" Le Drian said in a joint interview with the broadcasters LCI and RTL and the newspaper Le Figaro.
""We know that they are not in a very good condition and that they are not always being treated well ... We think Iran would give a strong signal by releasing them.""
The French newspaper Le Figaro reported in January, citing a colleague of the academics, that Adelkhah had been on hunger strike since Dec. 24 and was in extremely poor health, while Marchal was ""very unstable"".
The academics' university association says Marchal, an Africa expert, was arrested at Tehran airport as he arrived to spend the Eid religious holiday with Adelkhah in Iran."

Saudi authorities have not issued visas for the Iranian participants, ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said.
""The government of Saudi Arabia has prevented the participation of the Iranian delegation in the meeting to examine the 'deal of the century' plan at the headquarters of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation,"" Mousavi said, the Fars news agency reported.
Mousavi said Iran has filed a complaint with the OIC and accused Saudi Arabia of misusing its position as the host for the organization's headquarters. There was no immediate comment from Saudi officials.
Iranian officials have condemned Trump's plan for resolving the conflict between Israel and Palestine as a non-starter after it was officially announced last week. The Palestinian leadership has rejected the plan, saying it heavily favours Israel and will deny them a viable independent state.
Saudi Arabia and Iran are locked in a proxy war as they vie for influence across the Middle East. They support opposite sides in the conflicts in Syria and Yemen.

U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who invited Burhan for the visit during a phone call, said in December that the two countries planned to begin exchanging ambassadors after a 23-year hiatus.
Washington and Khartoum had been at odds for decades, but their relations have improved since Bashir's overthrow in April 2019 and the formation of a civilian transitional government four months later.
The purpose of the visit will be ""to discuss bilateral relations between the two countries and ways of developing them"", the council said in a statement, without giving a date for the trip but saying Burhan ""promised to fulfill it soon"".
Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and other cabinet ministers have visited Washington since the transitional government was sworn in. Burhan has visited several neighboring countries and Russia.
In 1993, the U.S. government added Sudan to its list of state sponsors of terrorism over allegations Bashir's Islamist government was supporting terrorist groups, a designation that makes Sudan technically ineligible for debt relief and financing from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
In November, however, a senior State Department official said the United States may remove Sudan from the list and that the two countries no longer had an adversarial relationship. Congress needs to approve such a removal."
1619,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>",And the Oscar goes to ... Planet Earth?,"By Jill Serjeant and Jane Ross
(Reuters) - From plant-based meals to repeat tuxedos and water bottle bans, Hollywood has come to embrace sustainability in an awards season usually known for excess.
Some of Hollywood's biggest stars, many of whom are vocal about environmental issues, are now turning words into action on red carpets and at gala dinners as they crisscross the United States for award shows and appearances.
Dinners at the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild and Critics' Choice Awards in January served up vegan fare, while the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has banned plastic water bottles at all Oscar events and said all food served will be sustainably farmed.
""Consuming animals is no longer just a personal choice. It is having a drastic and vast consequence on the rest of the world and all of us,"" said ""Joker"" best actor Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix, a lifelong vegan who encouraged organizers of the Golden Globes to switch to an entirely plant-based menu for the first time.
Others are ditching planes and private jets for electric or hybrid cars as they travel to film festivals in California and beyond.
""Stranger Things"" actor Brett Gelman is among those who say they have been spurred to review their lifestyles. ""I plan to change a great deal in my diet and the way I use energy, composting, the way I purchase clothing. ... I'm certainly not taking any private jets,"" Gelman told reporters last month.
Inspired by teen activist Greta Thunberg, Jane Fonda is bringing her Fire Drill Fridays climate change protest from Washington to Los Angeles, two days before next Sunday's Oscar ceremony.
To be sure, there is still a way to go. While celebrity gift bags this season include items like a ""self-watering, self-fertilizing farmstand"" they also offer cruises on luxury yachts.
Guests at the MusiCares gala dinner for rock band Aerosmith last month were served steak and chicken, on the same plate, and ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" actress Alex Borstein quipped that she planned to head to a steak house after a vegan dinner at the Critics' Choice Awards in January.
'NO HOLLYWOOD ON A DEAD PLANET'
The youth arm of the group Extinction Rebellion plans a protest at the famous Hollywood sign on the eve of the Academy Awards, aimed at persuading the entertainment industry to do more.
""Some stars of Hollywood are aware of the scale of the climate crisis, and some have started to take action. ... But we do not believe that Hollywood as a whole has taken an acceptable stance on the climate crisis,"" the group said in a statement, announcing the protest.
""There is no Hollywood on a dead planet,"" the group added.
Daniel Hinerfeld, director of content partnerships at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the publicity around initiatives like vegan dinners ""shows the power that Hollywood has to start conversations, to set trends, and to shift attitudes.""
But he urged the industry to do more and to use its storytelling powers to highlight climate change.
""We really need to see more film and TV that really is dealing with all of the incredibly complicated and dramatic and potentially comedic aspects of climate change, which is this huge drama,"" Hinerfeld said.
Red carpet fashion may be slow to catch up, despite the influence of designers like Jean Paul Gaultier, whose Paris retirement show in January featured upcycled haute couture, including skirts made out of silk ties.
Phoenix, who has won a slew of awards this year, won kudos in January for his plans to stick with the same tuxedo throughout the season.
""He chooses to make choices for the future of the planet. He has also chosen to wear this same tux for the entire award season to reduce waste,"" tweeted designer Stella McCartney, who provided the tux.
It remains to be seen whether other stars will follow suit, or choose recycled gowns for the world's biggest red carpet at the Oscars.
Rising New York-based designer Daniel Silverstein, who creates clothing from remnants and scraps, says he has not so far had any red carpet approaches for his Zero Waste Daniel label, although he is prepared to give A-listers the benefit of the doubt.
""People in Hollywood and the music industry are fanatical about using ethical beauty products. So I am sure there is a lot of sustainability under the surface that we don't even realize,"" he said.

""What I would hope to see more of is people with a platform using their opportunity to talk about their personal style and to change the conversation.""

1621,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2020 08:43AM ET</span>",Iraqi cleric Sadr tells followers to clear sit-ins after PM appointed,"By Aziz El Yaakoubi and Nadine Awadalla
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Populist Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr urged his followers on Sunday to help security forces clear roads blocked during months of sit-in protests, calling for a return to normal life after the designation of a new prime minister.
Sadr, who had alternately sided with the anti-government protesters and the Iran-backed political groups they reject, urged his unarmed supporters known as ""blue hats"" to work with authorities to ensure schools and businesses can operate normally again.
Protests broke out immediately in Baghdad and several southern cities on Saturday night after President Barham Salih named Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi as prime minister in an effort to end the political unrest.
On Sunday, thousands gathered in Baghdad's Tahrir square, where the main protest camp in the capital is located, to reject the move. They banged drums and chanted against Allawi and Sadr, saying ""Allawi is rejected and so are his parties"".
In a message issued on Twitter, Sadr said ""I advise the security forces to stop anyone from cutting off roads and the ministry of education should punish those who obstruct regular working hours, be they students, teachers or others"".
Some of his followers appeared to have helped already to clear out protest areas in Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ) overnight, a Reuters reporter said.
Hours before Allawi's appointment, the blue hats, armed with batons, attacked a skeleton building in Tahrir Square, known as the Turkish Restaurant, that demonstrators have occupied since October.
The building was mostly empty on Sunday and the blue hats stood guard, occupying its gates and pacing with walkie-talkies outside it.
""They attacked us by surprise and forced us out of the building shouting that we didn’t do any good to the country except ruining its economy,"" said Rassoul, 20, a protester who has lived in the Turkish Restaurant since October.
Anti-government protests continued nearby, with demonstrators directing their ire towards Allawi. He was named on Saturday as part of a deal between Sadr and rival Iran-backed political groups, who have wrangled since November's resignation of premier Adel Abdul Mahdi.
Allawi must form a government within a month and face a confidence vote in parliament. Iran welcomed his designation on Sunday.
Protesters demanding the removal of Iraq's ruling elite and the creation of better jobs and services have regularly blocked main roads in Baghdad and southern Iraq since demonstrations erupted in October.
U.N. AND EU FLAGS
Some of the protesters in Baghdad on Sunday waved the national flag while others had United Nations and European Union flags. ""We call on the UN to support and protect Iraqi protesters,"" read several signs. 
""Allawi is a member of the political game that has destroyed Iraq, he needs to go,"" said Malek Jawad, a student and protester. 
A dozen young Iraqis stood on a truck carrying massive speakers and cheered the crowed. 
""Moqtada al-Sadr sent conflicted messages since the beginning but at the end he made it clear that he’s against the protesters,"" Jawad added.
Sadr supporters watched the protesters from in and around the Turkish Restaurant.
Sadr has directed anti-government unrest in previous years but he has not been able to control this round of demonstrations and many protesters oppose him as much as the rest of the political class.
Sadr's supporters had previously bolstered the protesters and sometimes helped shield them from attacks by security forces and unidentified gunmen.
Many of Sadr's supporters hail from eastern Baghdad slums and share the same grievances as many Iraqis over a lack of job opportunities, poor healthcare and education.

The unrest is Iraq's biggest crisis for years. It has shattered nearly two years of calm that prevailed after the defeat of the Sunni Muslim extremist Islamic State in 2017.

1622,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2020 08:17AM ET</span>",Sovereignty comes first: Britain lays out tough stance for EU trade talks,"By Elizabeth Piper
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain laid out a tough opening stance for future talks with the European Union on Sunday, saying it would set its own agenda rather than meeting the bloc's rules to ensure frictionless trade.
After officially leaving the EU on Friday, Britain now must negotiate future trade relations with the bloc, to take effect when a standstill transition period expires at the end of the year.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government has been quick to send Brussels a message before trade talks begin in March: Brexit, for him, means sovereignty trumps the economy.
The EU has repeatedly told Britain the level of access to its lucrative single market will depend on how far London agrees to adhere to a ""level playing field"" -- shorthand for rules on environmental standards, labor regulations and state aid.
But despite the appeals of many businesses for the government to ensure goods can trade across borders freely, ministers have been briefing companies that they should adjust to a new future when Britain will not adhere to EU rules.
Johnson, according to sources close to him, has taken last year's election, which handed him a large majority in parliament, as approval for his policy of putting Britain's right to set its own rules above the demands of businesses. He will outline that approach in a speech on Monday. 
""We are taking back control of our laws, so we are not going to have high alignment with the EU, legislative alignment with their rules,"" foreign minister Dominic Raab told Sky News. ""But we'll want to cooperate and we expect the EU to follow through on their commitment to a Canada-style free trade agreement.""
After more than three years of often tortuous talks, Johnson wants to draw a line under what has been an angry debate that has deepened divides across the country. His aim is a trade deal allowing for tariff- and quota-free trade in goods, similar to the terms the bloc now has in place with Canada.
Asked whether the government expected businesses to have to prepare for new checks on goods at the border, Raab said: ""The agreement that we made with the EU was to avoid all of that, and I am sure they will want to live up to the undertakings they have made just as we'd expect to do the same.""
Late on Saturday, a government source said if the EU would not offer a Canada-style trade deal, London would instead pursue a looser trade agreement, similar to the bloc's ties with Australia.
""There are only two likely outcomes in negotiation - a free trade deal like Canada or a looser arrangement like Australia - and we are happy to pursue both,"" the source said.
The EU says it will not seal a trade deal with a large, economically powerful neighbor without solid provisions to guarantee fair competition. Some European leaders fear Johnson could try to undercut EU businesses by loosening regulatory standards, something he has promised not to do.
""If Great Britain wants to establish outside the European Union a sort of 'Singapore-on-Thames', we would be against it,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a joint interview with broadcasters LCI and RTL and Le Figaro newspaper.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar also called on the British government not to set strict red lines, saying this could make an already difficult negotiation even harder.

""One thing I'd say to everyone is let's not repeat some of the errors that were made in the past two-and-a-half years,"" Varadkar told the BBC. ""Let's not set such rigid red lines that makes it hard to come to an agreement and let's tone down the nationalistic rhetoric.""

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - At least 20 people were killed and more than a dozen hurt in a stampede as worshippers rushed to be anointed during a church service in northern Tanzania, officials said on Sunday.
Thousands of people crammed into a sports stadium for the service on Saturday evening in the town of Moshi near Mount Kilimanjaro, with many getting crushed after the pastor called them to be anointed with ""blessed oil.""
The pastor was arrested later for his role in the incident as he sought to leave the country, officials said.
""Twenty people died and 16 others were injured in the incident,"" Moshi district commissioner Kippi Warioba told Reuters by telephone. Five of the dead were children, he said.
""The stampede occurred when the worshippers were rushing to get anointed with blessed oil,"" Warioba said.
Pastor Boniface Mwamposa had been drawing huge crowds by promising prosperity and cures for diseases to worshippers who step in what he calls ""blessed oil"" during his services.
He was arrested on Sunday in Tanzania's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, as he attempted to flee the country, home affairs minister George Simbachawene said on Sunday.
""Mwamposa tried to flee after this incident, but we arrested him in Dar es Salaam ... he will be held accountable for causing this tragedy,"" the minister said.
According to the minister, the stampede took place after the pastor instructed worshippers, who numbered some 10,000, to rush to one side of the stadium all at once to get anointed.
Authorities fear the death toll could rise due to the size of the crowd and poor lighting when the stampede occurred.
""The incident took place at night and there were many people, so there is a possibility that more casualties could emerge. We are still assessing the situation,"" Warioba said.
Tanzania has seen a rise in the number of ""prosperity gospel"" pastors in recent years, who promise to lift people out of poverty and perform what they call miracle cures.
Thousands of people in the nation of 55 million flock to Pentecostal churches, whose main source of income is ""tithe"", the 10% or so of income that worshippers are asked to contribute.

The Business Post/Red C poll put the left-wing Sinn Fein up five percentage points in the space of a week to 24% and level with the center-right Fianna Fail, which fell two points. Support for Fine Gael dipped by the same amount to 21%.
Sinn Fein stood at 11% in the last Business Post/Red C poll before Prime Minister Leo Varadkar called the Feb. 8 election that has focused on the high cost of housing and deficiencies in healthcare in the European Union's fastest growing economy.
Setting out her party's priorities in Dublin on Sunday, Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said voters had an opportunity to disrupt the political balance that has seen Fianna Fail and Fine Gael swap power since the foundation of the state.
""Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have been in power in this state for almost a century. They’ve had it all their own way and they’ve had their chance,"" she said.
Running fewer candidates than it did in the 2016 election and around half the number being fielded by both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, all 42 Sinn Fein candidates would likely have to be elected to the 160-seat chamber to give it a shot at emerging as the largest party.
Such a scenario remains highly improbable, analysts say.
However a marked improvement on its 22 outgoing seats would put pressure on the two traditionally dominant parties to drop their refusal to govern with Sinn Fein, both due to the party's IRA links and its opposing economic policies.
Speaking on BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Leo Varadkar said ""you won't see a coalition between my party and Sinn Fein, that's not going to happen"".
""The likelihood is it's actually going to be very difficult to form a government over the next couple of months.""
The other option is a second successive minority government, this time more likely led by Fianna Fail but needing another ""confidence and supply"" deal with Fine Gael. 
The two historic rivals have never gone into coalition government together and Fianna Fail still resists such a move.
All other opinion polls so far during the campaign have put Fianna Fail in front on its own, with most showing Sinn Fein closing in on Fine Gael in second place.
""The crucial campaign momentum is with Sinn Fein, and appears founded on a desire for fundamental change in the established order,"" said Red C chief executive Richard Colwell.
""What is apparent is that, on these numbers, it is going to be difficult for any party to form a government unless they go into coalition with each other. The alternative is that we could be having another election very soon.""

During in his trip on Monday and Tuesday, Borrell will meet Iran's President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif among others.
""Borrell received a strong mandate from the EU foreign ministers to engage in diplomatic dialogue with regional partners, to de-escalate tensions and seek opportunities for political solutions to the current crisis,"" the statement said.
Tensions in the region stepped up after the killing in early January of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani by the United States in Iraq.

Bridget McKenzie, the former sports minister and deputy leader of the National party - the junior member of the coalition government - has been battling for weeks to save her political career after a damning audit into public spending.
More recently, McKenzie served as Minister for Agriculture, a high-profile role given Australia's sustained drought and ongoing bushfire crisis.
Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison had backed McKenzie to remain in a leadership role, but his support weakened after revelations that the Nationals lawmaker approved a A$36,000 ($24,620) grant for a shooting club where she was a member.
A departmental report found McKenzie's failure to disclose her gun club membership breached ministerial rules, triggering the resignation on Sunday.
""On the basis of that, and it is a conflict of interest in the failure to disclose, the minister has tendered her resignation to me this afternoon,"" Morrison said at a media briefing.
Morrison said the report did not find McKenzie's use of the sports funds breached ministerial standards. The topic is likely to be debated when Australia's parliament resumes this week.
McKenzie said in a news release that although she accepted the report from the department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, her membership of the shooting club did not influence her decision making.
Morrison secured re-election in May 2019, defying polls that had indicated voters would punish the conservative government for the backbench revolt that ousted former leader Malcolm Turnbull in 2018.
In an effort to regain ground in the polls, Morrison's government promised record investment in local sports. 
Australian National Audit Office said 400 projects received funding, with more than 70% done without any endorsement by the governing body for sport in Australia.

“We have signed the deal,” Kurti told a joint press conference with LDK leader Isa Mustafa.

SYDNEY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Wildfires that threatened Australia's capital, Canberra, over the weekend have been brought under control as containment lines held and hot and windy conditions eased, prompting authorities to lift a state of emergency. 
While fire in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), home to the capital city, has spread to more than 55,000 hectares (136,000 acres), close to a quarter of the territory's entire landmass, the heat fuelling the danger is subsiding.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the threat was not yet over and that there may be weeks of firefighting ahead.
""We may need to return to a state of emergency if the situation requires it,"" he said on Sunday.
The ACT declared a state of emergency leading into the weekend, which gave authorities greater powers to order evacuations, close roads and take control of properties as fire threatened suburban areas. 
It was the first time an emergency was declared in Australia's capital since 2003 when fires destroyed almost 500 houses and led to four deaths.
But containment lines supported by airdrops of fire retardant helped keep the blaze back over the weekend, even in the face of wild winds and elevated temperatures which only fell in the capital overnight on Saturday, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.
The dangerous conditions started to ease on Sunday, and there is favorable weather - and even rain - forecast for the rest of the week in the nation's capital.
Australia's prolonged bushfire season has killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals since September. About 2,500 homes have been destroyed and more than 11.7 million hectares of tinder-dry bushland have been razed.
The fire in the southern tip of the ACT also crossed into the state of New South Wales (NSW) and destroyed some homes, authorities said on Sunday.
Seventy fires were burning across NSW late on Sunday afternoon, with 30 of those not contained. NSW Health issued a statement saying air quality would be poor in parts of the state, including Sydney, due to a combination of bushfire smoke and dust blowing in from drought-hit areas.
Affected residents were urged to stay indoors and minimize physical activity, NSW Health said, adding those with chronic respiratory and cardiovascular conditions are particularly at risk.
Parts of NSW were struck by thunderstorms late on Sunday which helped douse flames, although authorities said storms could also trigger new fires.
""Widespread thunderstorms and lightning strikes today may produce new ignitions,"" the NSW Rural Fire Service said in a tweet.

""Cooler conditions have seen reduced fire activity across most firegrounds today.""

NUR-SULTAN (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Kazakhstan on Sunday to join Washington in pressing Beijing over its treatment of Muslim minorities, a sensitive matter for the Central Asian nation which has close ties with its neighbor China.
Speaking on a visit to the capital Nur-Sultan, Pompeo said he has raised the matter in talks with Kazakh Foreign Minister Mukhtar Tleuberdi.
""We discussed trafficking in persons and the plight of more one million Uighur Muslims and ethnic Kazakhs that the Chinese Communist Party has detained in Xinjiang, just across the Kazakh border,"" Pompeo said.
""The United States urges all countries to join us in pressing for an immediate end to this repression. We ask simply for them to provide safe refuge and asylum to those seeking to flee China.""
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate between 1 million and 2 million people, mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions as part of what Beijing calls an anti-terrorism campaign.
China has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs and says the camps provide vocational training. It describes the detainees as students.
Both the United States and China - which are caught up in a broad dispute over trade and other issues - are major investors in Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic.
Pompeo said on Twitter he met families of ethnic Kazakhs detained in China's Xinjiang province, and praised Kazakhstan for not forcing asylum-seekers to return to China.
Pompeo said the United States was helping oil-rich Kazakhstan protect itself against the coronavirus outbreak originating from China.
Tleuberdi made no comment on the Uighur issue and focused instead on economic and security cooperation.

YOKOSUKA (Reuters) - A Japanese destroyer left for the Gulf of Oman on Sunday amid simmering Middle East tension to guard sea lanes that supply nearly all the oil that powers the world's third-biggest economy.
""Thousands of Japanese ships ply those waters every year including vessels carrying nine tenths of our oil. It is Japan's lifeline,"" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the crew at Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo, before they cast off in a ceremony attended by 500 family members and representatives from the United States, European nations and Middle East.
Abe's government has said it is prepared to authorize force to protect ships in danger, a controversial decision because Japan's war-renouncing constitution forbids the use of military force in international disputes.
The Takanami, which will be joined by two maritime patrol planes, will not, however join a naval force led by Japan's U.S. ally or other naval coalitions in the region. 
Tokyo has chosen to operate independently as it navigates disputes in the volatile region. Japan maintains cordial relations with Iran and other countries there and Abe traveled to the region in January to brief Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman on the mission after earlier speaking with Iranian leaders.
Tension in the Middle East has heightened as friction between Iran and the United States escalated following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and re-impose sanctions on it.
The United States has blamed Iran for several attacks on international merchant vessels, including a Japanese-owned tanker, the Kokuka Courageous. Tehran denies the accusation.
In addition to the Gulf of Oman, the Takanami, with 200 sailors and two helicopters, will patrol the northern Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden, but will not enter the Strait of Hormuz, a strategically important choke point between Iran and the Arabian peninsula.
The Japanese destroyer will share water in the region with a growing number of warships from other countries, including vessels from the United States, France and Britain.
""Japanese merchant ships were attacked in June, and other nations have increased patrols so Japan too is acting to gather intelligence there,"" the mission commander, Captain Yosuke Inaba told reporters before he departed.

(Reuters) - U.S. health officials on Saturday confirmed an eighth case of the fast-spreading new coronavirus in the United States and the Pentagon said it would provide housing for people arriving from overseas who might need to be quarantined.
The latest U.S. patient, who is in Massachusetts, recently returned from Hubei province in central China, the epicenter of the outbreak, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in an emailed statement. The person was not identified and no other details were provided.
The flu-like coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in a market that traded illegally in wildlife in Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, has so far resulted in 304 deaths in China, state broadcaster CCTV said early on Sunday in China. Confirmed cases of the virus have been reported in 27 other nations, according to the CDC.
All but one of the patients in the United States was believed to have contracted the disease while they were traveling in the Wuhan area. U.S. officials this week reported the first human-to-human transmission of the disease in the United States in Illinois.
Concerns about the virus spurred the Trump administration to declare a public health emergency and bar entry to the United States for foreign nationals who have recently visited China.
In addition, U.S. citizens who have traveled within the past two weeks to Hubei will be subject to a mandatory quarantine of 14 days, believed to be the incubation period of the virus, officials said.
Americans who visited other parts of mainland China will undergo special health screening upon their return, followed by up to 14 days of ""monitored self-quarantine,"" under the temporary restrictions.
In a statement on Saturday, the Pentagon said Defense Secretary Mark Esper approved a request for assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services for housing support for 1,000 people who may be subject to quarantine on arrival from overseas.
Health officials had asked the Defense Department to provide several facilities capable of housing at least 250 people in individual rooms through Feb. 29.
The Pentagon said four military installations have been selected: two in California, one in Colorado, and one in Texas. It said Defense Department personnel would only provide housing support and HHS would be responsible for all care and transportation.
""DOD personnel will not be directly in contact with the evacuees and evacuees will not have access to any base location other than their assigned housing,"" the Pentagon said.
QUARANTINE PROCEDURES
The first quarantines of U.S. citizens potentially exposed to coronavirus in China began hours before the White House announcement on Friday.
Nearly 200 Americans evacuated earlier this week from Wuhan and voluntarily confined to a California military air base for 72 hours of health screenings were placed under a mandatory 14-day quarantine on Friday.
By Saturday afternoon, none of those quarantined showed any symptoms of having the virus, said Jose Arballo, a spokesman for the public health department in Riverside County, where the air base is located. He said test results were still pending.
The order to keep the Americans on the base marked the CDC's first mandatory quarantine for decades.
""Since this hasn't been done in 51 years there's quite the scramble to work through all the procedures,"" a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official said, adding that the last mandatory quarantine was ordered to fight smallpox.
The official, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said DHS personnel would take over running medical screenings at airports this weekend to free up their CDC counterparts for other tasks.
State and local authorities will likely play a role with mandatory quarantines, the official said, which could mean ""a lot of variance across the country for how it gets implemented.""
A DHS spokeswoman denied the department was scrambling and said it has been working on these plans since last summer, when it began contracting medical professionals and readying quarantine and health screening plans in case it had to ramp up for the Ebola outbreak.
""We were able to quickly tailor those plans and contracts to the coronavirus,"" said the spokeswoman, Heather Swift.
Swift said state and local officials are always involved in public health and emergency response, but that there is a uniform standard. ""All passengers who receive a positive symptoms screening will be placed in quarantine. Those who show no symptoms will be sent home on self-quarantine,"" she said.
Nearly 12,000 people have been infected globally by the virus, according to the WHO, with all but just over 130 of those cases occurring in China.
U.S. health officials have said risks to the United States remain low."

URUAPAN, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican authorities said on Saturday they are investigating the possible murder of a tour guide working at a famous butterfly reserve in the western state of Michoacan, just two days after its former environmental activist was buried.
Raul Hernandez's body was found in the area in the early hours of Saturday, with different parts beaten, and a head injury possibly caused by a sharp object, the state attorney general said.
Earlier this week, Mexicans in El Rosario mourned the death of activist Homero Gomez, who had fought for a decade to protect the monarch butterflies until his mysterious death. It is unclear whether the two cases are connected.
The sudden disappearance of such a high-profile campaigner had sparked an outcry in Mexico, an increasingly violent country where activists are routinely threatened, harmed or even killed as a result of their work.
Millions of the orange and black insects make a 2,000-mile (3,220-km) journey each year from Canada to winter in central Mexico's warmer weather. However, they are facing new challenges linked to extreme weather and changing habitat.
Michoacan state is not only home to the country's largest monarch butterfly reserve, a World Heritage Site, but also rival drug gangs who battle to control smuggling routes through often-arid terrain to the Pacific and the interior of the country."

Alejandrina Gisselle Guzman married Edgar Cazares, the nephew of Blanca Margarita Cazares, Mexican newspaper Reforma reported on Saturday, in the heartland of Mexico's powerful Sinaloa Cartel.
The wedding took place on Jan. 25, Reforma said. Photographs and videos, including performances of a popular Mexican band and singers, fireworks, and yellow tape around the cathedral, were shared on social media.
A source at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Culiacan, confirmed the wedding took place, but declined to give details. The couple could not be reached for comment. 
Culiacan citizens living and working near the cathedral told Reuters on Saturday that they had noticed an extravagant wedding though they had been unaware of who the couple was. 
""The church is for everyone,"" Sofia, who declined to give her surname, said. ""But the church shouldn't give privileges to anyone."" Others agreed. ""With money, you can close any building here,"" Francisca added. ""It's unfair."" 
Blanca Margarita Cazares was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in 2007 for her ""sophisticated money laundering apparatus"" and links to Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada Garcia and Victor Emilio Cazares of the Sinaloa Cartel. 
Reuters could not determine charges against the couple. 
The Sinaloa Cartel has kept a firm grip on the drug trade even as ""El Chapo"" is serving a life sentence in prison in the United States; business has been proceeding unabated under the leadership of his sons and their associates.
Hundreds of heavily armed Sinaloa Cartel members, guns blazing, last year took the modern city of about a million people hostage after son Ovidio was detained. Within hours, he was released. 
Meanwhile, his daughter has been capitalizing on his legacy with the launch of the ""El Chapo 701"" brand last year. In January, she diversified the brand's business line from fashion into beverages with the launch of an ""El Chapo"" beer. 

The brand got its name from when Forbes named her father the 701st richest person in the world in 2009, estimating his net worth at $1 billion.

CAIRO (Reuters) - The Palestinian Authority has cut all ties with the United States and Israel, including those relating to security, after rejecting a Middle East peace plan presented by U.S. President Donald Trump, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Saturday.
Abbas was in Cairo to address the Arab League, which backed the Palestinians in their opposition to Trump's plan.
The blueprint, endorsed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calls for the creation of a demilitarised Palestinian state that excludes Jewish settlements built in occupied territory and is under near-total Israeli security control.
""We've informed the Israeli side ... that there will be no relations at all with them and the United States including security ties,"" Abbas told the one-day emergency meeting, called to discuss Trump's plan.
Israeli officials had no immediate comment on his remarks.
Israel and the Palestinian Authority's security forces have long cooperated in policing areas of the occupied West Bank that are under Palestinian control. The PA also has intelligence cooperation agreements with the CIA, which continued even after the Palestinians began boycotting the Trump administration's peace efforts in 2017.
Abbas also said he had refused to discuss the plan by with Trump by phone, or to receive even a copy of it to study it.
""Trump asked that I speak to him by phone but I said 'no', and that he wants to send me a letter ... but I refused it,"" he said.
Abbas said he did not want Trump to be able to say that he, Abbas, had been consulted.
He reiterated his ""complete"" rejection of the Trump plan, presented on Tuesday. ""I will not have it recorded in my history that I sold Jerusalem,"" he said.
PALESTINIAN RIGHTS
The blueprint also proposes U.S. recognition of Israeli settlements on occupied West Bank land and of Jerusalem as Israel's indivisible capital.
The Arab League foreign ministers meeting in Cairo said the plan did not meet the minimum aspirations of Palestinians, and that the League would not cooperate with the United States in implementing it.
The ministers affirmed Palestinian rights to create a future state based on the land captured and occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, with East Jerusalem as capital, the final communique said.
Foreign ministers from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, three close U.S. allies, as well as Iraq, Lebanon and others said there could be no peace without recognising Palestinian rights to establish a state within the pre-1967 territories.
After Trump unveiled his plan, some Arab powers had appeared, despite historic support for the Palestinians, to prioritise close ties with the United States and a shared hostility towards Iran over traditional Arab alliances.
Three Gulf Arab states - Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates - attended the White House gathering where Trump announced his plan alongside Netanyahu.
On Tuesday, Netanyahu said he would ask his cabinet this week to approve the application of Israeli law to Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
Such a move could be a first step towards formal annexation of the settlements and the Jordan Valley - territory Israel has kept under military occupation since its capture in 1967.

Most countries consider Israeli settlements on land captured in war to be a violation of international law. Trump has changed U.S. policy to withdraw such objections.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2020 03:31PM ET</span>",Jihadist car bomb attacks target Syrian pro-government forces in Aleppo,"By Khalil Ashawi and Tom Perry
AZAZ, Syria/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian insurgents carried out two suicide car bomb attacks in an assault on pro-government forces in Aleppo on Saturday and opened a new front northeast of the city, an attempted fightback after territorial gains for President Bashar al-Assad.
Backed by Russian air power, Syrian government forces had made a significant advance into the rebel-held northwest this week, seizing the town of Maarat al-Numan, part of an offensive to secure the main highway between Damascus and Aleppo.
The suicide attacks were carried out by jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and targeted the Jamiyat al Zahraa area on the western edge of Aleppo. A third car bomb was set off by remote control, a source with the group said. 
A news outlet linked to the group, Ebaa, published a video which it said showed elite Tahrir al-Sham fighters pledging ""allegiance to death and jihad"" before the attack on Jamiyat al-Zahraa, watched by the group's leader, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani.
The northwestern corner of Syria including Idlib province and adjoining areas of Aleppo is the last major rebel foothold in Syria, where Assad has taken back most of the ground once held by his enemies with Russian and Iranian support. 
Syrian state news agency SANA said army troops had destroyed four car bombs before they reached their targets. Syrian army forces were firing rockets and artillery at militant groups on the Jamiyat al-Zahraa front, it said. Militants had also fired rockets at residential districts of Aleppo.
The two sides gave conflicting accounts of the outcome of the attack.
A news outlet run by Lebanon's Hezbollah, which fights in support of Assad, said the Syrian army had thwarted a ""fierce attack"" by the Nusra Front, as Jolani's group was known until it broke ties with al Qaeda in 2016.
But the jihadist-linked Ebaa news outlet said the attacking forces had captured a group of houses on a hill overlooking Aleppo. 
GOVERNMENT CONTROL 
The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham source said the attacks had targeted the ""Iranian occupation militias"", a reference to Iran-backed groups fighting in support of Assad.
Aleppo city has been under full government control since 2016, when pro-Damascus forces defeated rebels in the east of the city.
Some 50 km (35 miles) northeast of Aleppo, Turkish-backed rebels attacked government-held positions near the city of al-Bab, a rebel source and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. Turkish forces were not taking part, rebels said. 
The government's latest offensive has triggered a fresh wave of civilian displacement, with hundreds of thousands moving towards the Turkish border.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday Turkey may launch a military operation in Idlib unless the fighting there is halted. 
The U.S. special envoy for Syria said on Thursday the Idlib fighting raised the spectre of an international crisis.

Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, fears a fresh wave of migrants. It has 12 military observation posts around Idlib, set up under an agreement with Russia and Iran, and several of them have since been surrounded by advancing government forces.

1640,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2020 11:59AM ET</span>","Iraq president appoints Allawi as new premier, protesters reject him","By John Davison and Aziz El Yaakoubi
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi President Barham Salih appointed Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi as prime minister on Saturday, state television reported, after squabbling parties failed to name a candidate in the two months since Adel Abdul-Mahdi was ousted by mass protests.
Allawi, who will run Iraq until early elections can be held, must form a new government within a month and will likely get stuck between powerful parties vying for cabinet posts, prolonging the political deadlock.
Allawi said he would resign if political blocs attempted to impose candidates for cabinet jobs, and called on protesters to continue demonstrating until their demands are met.
""I'm an employee (at your service) carrying your trust, so do not go back until you get what you want, whether from me or someone else,"" he said in a video message posted to his Twitter feed and broadcast by state television. 
""If the political blocs try to impose their candidates (for ministers) on me, then I will resign.""
Abdul-Mahdi quit in November during mass anti-government unrest in which hundreds of thousands of Iraqis took to the streets to demand the removal of Iraq's political elite.
Nearly 500 protesters have been killed since October in a deadly crackdown by security forces.
Soon after the president's announcement, protesters gathered in Baghdad and southern cities expressed opposition to Allawi's appointment in videos posted on social media.
""Allawi is rejected,"" they chanted in one video that was filmed at Baghdad's Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ), the center of the uprising in the Iraqi capital.
For the demonstrators, Allawi, the former communications minister under ex-premier Nuri al-Maliki -- who presided over the fall of multiple Iraqi cities to Islamic State in 2014 and is accused of pro-Shi'ite sectarian policies -- is part of the ruling elite and therefore unacceptable.
LACK OF SUPPORT
Hours before Allawi's appointment, supporters of populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr attacked protesters in Tahrir square. 
Sadr called on Friday for a mass protest in Baghdad and for sit-ins near the fortified Green Zone to protest the delayed formation of a government, without specifying when the gatherings should take place.
Sadr later supported Allawi's appointment, saying he had been ""chosen by the people"" and that this was a ""good step"" for Iraq. Sadr, a political opportunist, has both backed protests and sided with the Iran-backed political groups they reject.
The Dawa party, meanwhile, rejected Allawi's premiership, saying in a statement that any candidate being decided at this stage was unlikely to have unanimous support.
With a rejection from at least one party and by protesters, Allawi faces an uphill struggle in forming a fully independent cabinet.
The two most powerful blocs in parliament, led by populist Sadr and a group of Iran-backed and paramilitary-linked parties, respectively, will insist on securing key ministerial posts for their own candidates, likely causing many more months of political deadlock.
Iraq is facing its biggest crisis since the military defeat of Islamic State in 2017. A mostly Shi'ite popular uprising in Baghdad and the south challenges the country's mainly Iran-backed Shi'ite Muslim ruling elite. 
The country has been thrown into further disarray since the killing of Iranian military mastermind Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3. Iran responded with missile attacks on bases hosting U.S. forces, pushing the region to the brink of an all-out conflict.
Pro-Iran politicians have tried to use those events to shift the focus away from popular discontent with their grip on power and towards anti-American rallies and demands for the withdrawal of U.S. troops.

The Treasury said it deleted COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Co from its sanctions list but continues to blacklist a second unit - COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman & Ship Management Co Ltd.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Suspected Islamist militants killed at least 62 civilians in a series of attacks this week in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where the army is waging a counter-insurgency campaign against the rebels, the government said on Saturday.
The upsurge in violence after a period of relative calm in early January undercuts government claims of security progress against the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group active in Beni territory.
Rights group CEPADHO said ADF fighters had killed at least 74 civilians, many of them women and children, with knives and guns. It said the attacks spanned about 10 villages over the course of less than 48 hours.
The army has repeatedly claimed to have made sweeping progress against the group by killing several top commanders and capturing many of the its camps in the dense forests near the Ugandan border.
But the ADF, which arrived in Congo from Uganda in the 1990s, has survived frequent onslaughts from Congolese force and U.N. peacekeepers, and taken revenge on civilian populations.
It is one of dozens of armed groups active in Congo's mineral-rich eastern borderlands, where regional wars around the turn of the century resulted in millions of deaths. 
Officials said on Wednesday that at least 30 people had been killed overnight near the city of Oicha. Civil society activists reported that dozens more civilians were killed in attacks on nearby villages on Thursday.
The government provided the death toll of 62 in the minutes of a cabinet meeting, without offering any additional details. It said the army was ""dismantling the networks of collaborators and other agents thanks to information provided by captured ADF fighters"".
The Kivu Security Tracker, a research initiative that maps unrest in the region, said the latest attacks bring to at least 312 the number of civilian killed by the ADF in Beni since Congo's army launched its offensive on Oct. 30. 
Islamic State has publicly claimed responsibility for several attacks carried out in Beni territory, but the United Nations and various researchers have been unable to confirm any direct link between IS and the ADF.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Several thousand protesters took to the streets in Ethiopian cities this week, demanding Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed do more to tackle simmering ethnic violence following the kidnapping of a group of university students.
Armed men abducted the students from Dembi Dollo University in the Oromiya region in early December, according to survivors who escaped. The government said earlier this week that the army had rescued 21 of the students, but at least 12 others are still missing.
While the kidnappers' identity or motive is not clear, the incident has revived widespread fears about ethnic violence ahead of this year's election and intensified pressure on Nobel Peace Laureate Abiy, who comes from the Oromo ethnic group.
Many of the students were Amhara, a group that has clashed with Oromos in the past.
In the past six months, clashes on campus have killed 12 students and played a role in the decision of 35,000 to drop out of university, according to the higher education ministry.
Anger about the kidnapping has focused on Abiy, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for signing a peace deal with former enemy Eritrea and has overseen political reforms since coming to power in 2018.
He has been unable, however, to stamp out ethnic violence in Africa's second-most populous nation, including among his Oromo group.
Families of the missing students met the prime minister and other senior government officials on Thursday, receiving assurances that their relatives were safe but no further information about their whereabouts or any plans to rescue them.
""We were just told by the officials that they are alive,"" said Yeneneh Adugna, a local priest and a farmer from Gondar, whose 23-year-old daughter Germanesh Yeneneh, a third-year biotechnology student, is missing.
""The last phone call conversation I had with her was two weeks after her abduction,"" Yeneneh said. ""She told me not to worry.""
Several thousand people took part in marches in a handful of cities during the week to demand their release and activists made #BringBackOurStudents trend online.
Another protest is planned in Gondor, the capital of Amhara, on Sunday, the families said.
Belay Abebe, father to a second-year journalism student, said his daughter had also called him after she was abducted and said she was safe. 
""We ... demanded to talk to the students over the phone,"" another relative of one of the students told Reuters, asking for anonymity for fear of possible reprisals. ""There was no willingness from the officials to let us speak with the students.""
Endeshaw Tasew, general commissioner of the federal police, said on Wednesday that the government knows where the students are but declined to give further details.

MINSK (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Belarus on Saturday, seeking to ""normalize"" ties at a time when relations between Minsk and its traditional ally Russia are under strain. 
The United States and the European Union have been frequent critics of authoritarian rule and the human rights record in Belarus, where President Alexander Lukashenko has been in office since 1994.
But Western powers have lifted most sanctions on Belarus since Lukashenko released political prisoners and showed more tolerance for political opposition. 
Ties also improved after Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula that Belarus refused to recognize. Belarus and the United States plan to bring back ambassadors to their respective countries after a 10-year hiatus. 
Pompeo, the most senior U.S. official to visit in more than two decades, said at a meeting with Lukashenko that Washington supported the independence of Belarus while being aware of Minsk's longstanding ties to Russia.
""There's a long history with Russia. It's not about picking us between the two. We want to be here,"" he said.
Washington would appoint a new ambassador to Minsk soon, Pompeo said, adding that the United States would continue to push for human rights reforms while also fostering closer economic ties.
OIL CONTRACT 
Russia sees Belarus as a buffer zone between it and the West, and it has helped prop up Lukashenko with loans and energy subsidies. But it started to scale back that help last year.
Relations soured after the two sides failed to agree on an oil supply contract for this year.
The row fed into a broader dispute between Moscow and Minsk in which Lukashenko has accused the Kremlin of trying to bully Belarus into a union with Russia.
But Washington, in another boost to its ties with Belarus, on Friday omitted it from a list of countries under a travel ban after earlier signaling its possible inclusion. 
""It is very good that you, after all kinds of misunderstandings in relations between Belarus and the United States, absolutely baseless misunderstandings ... you risked coming to Minsk to look at this country,"" Lukashenko told Pompeo.
In an apparent joking reference to the West's characterization of him as a dictator, Lukashenko told Pompeo: ""Our dictatorship is different, in that everybody is resting on Saturday and Sunday, and the president works.""
Lukashenko has said he held talks with the United States and other countries to find alternative oil supplies. Moscow suspended supplies to refineries in Belarus from Jan. 1, though it partially restored them on Jan. 4.
""The United States wants to help Belarus build its own sovereign country. Our energy producers stand ready to deliver 100% of the oil you need at competitive prices,"" Pompeo said at a meeting with Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei.
""Your nation should not be forced to be dependent on any one partner for your prosperity or for your security.""
In the run-up to Pompeo's visit, a senior official in President Donald Trump's administration had said:
""This is an era of great power competition and an opportunity to compete for influence.""

The agreement on water access to Guernsey coasts, one of the Channel Islands situated near the French coast of Normandy, was based on a European fisheries treaty that expired automatically on Friday night with Britain's exit from the European Union.
Britain and the EU now need to negotiate a post-Brexit trade agreement but for now, the relationship is a business-as-usual transition period until the end of this year, meaning that French fishermen would retain access to Guernsey waters.
However the authorities in Guernsey, a British crown dependency, decided to install a new system where boats would need to get individual authorizations to enter the waters 6 to 12 miles off its coasts.
""The procedure for requesting these authorizations must be put in place next week. During this period, access by French vessels to Guernsey waters is temporarily suspended,"" the Agricultural Ministry said in a statement.
The governments of Guernsey, Alderney and Sark said in a statement on Friday that they had put in place a package of measures to ensure continuity of access for the remainder of 2020 for French vessels that previously fished in their waters.
The French ministry said fishing in Guernsey waters accounted for a small part of fisheries activities in the area.

It gave figures for 2018, saying around 140 boats went fishing in Guernsey waters rich with lobsters, king scallops and crabs, with only 30 of them active in late January and early February.

MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Firefighters kept wild blazes fueled by strong winds and soaring temperatures from reaching suburban areas of Australia's capital, Canberra, using airdrops of fire retardant to create a 2.5-kilometre (1.55-mile) long defensive line late on Saturday.
Three drops of the pink retardant created the line along the bottom of a mountain south of Canberra, authorities said, with further drops planned for Sunday.
Fire crews had so far been able to save all structures in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), home to Canberra, authorities said.
""This has been a good firefighting day for us, in terms of protecting our cultural assets and critical infrastructure,"" ACT Emergency Services Agency Commissioner Georgeina Whelan said on Saturday evening.
""Our intent tonight is to undertake backburning operations to consolidate those containment lines.""
There were fears earlier in the day that the blaze could reach Canberra's southern suburbs, threatening homes and lives as they did in 2003 when fires destroyed almost 500 houses and claimed four lives.
Skies along the Monaro Highway in the ACT turned orange-red on Saturday as an uncontrolled blaze ballooned to more than 50,000 hectares (123,500 acres) in size.
A major highway was closed and authorities issued warnings for some residents that it was too late to evacuate, before conditions started to ease late in the day.
The territory declared a state of emergency on Friday in anticipation of the hot and windy conditions that are expected to last through the weekend.
Australia's devastating and prolonged bushfire season has killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals since September. About 2,500 homes have been destroyed and more than 11.7 million hectares (2.8 million acres) of tinder-dry bushland have been razed.
A second major uncontrolled fire was burning slightly further south in the Snowy Monaro region of New South Wales state on Saturday, the same alpine area where an air tanker crashed on Jan. 22 after dropping fire retardant, killing three American firefighters.
Temperatures exceeded 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in parts of NSW and the ACT on Saturday, prompting widespread warnings for people to be alert to the potential fire danger.
Some fires were generating their own weather patterns, including thunderstorms, in Australia's southeast, authorities said.
Around 20 fires were burning in Victoria state, with one at emergency level. Away from the firegrounds, intense rainfall was forecast, with authorities warning of potential ""dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding.""

""When it comes to the weather, it's really the tale of two states,"" Victoria Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Talks will resume in early March between representatives of the Thai government and the main insurgent group fighting for independence in the country largely Muslim-Malay south, the head of the government team on Friday.
The conflict in the Malay-speaking region of predominantly Buddhist Thailand has flared on and off since the area was annexed by the Thais in 1909, with the latest round that started in 2004 killing some 7,000.
Kuala Lumpur last week hosted a meeting between Thai officials and envoys of the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN), which observers say controls the majority of fighters on the ground and which pulled out of peace talks in 2014.
General Wanlop Rugsanaoh, the head of the Thai dialogue team, said he was cautiously optimistic following the Malaysia talks.
""The first session was a meeting for trust-building ... and now it will be about the proposals from both sides,"" Wanlop told reporters. ""This (next meeting) will take place round early March.""
The general said the talk will only be between his team and the BRN for now with mediation from Malaysia. The process would gradually bring in other insurgent and civil society groups, he said.

Ashmawy was captured in the eastern Libyan city of Derna in late 2018 and transferred by authorities loyal to commander Khalifa Haftar to Egypt in May last year.
He was convicted on several charges including plotting a 2014 attack that killed 22 military guards near the frontier with Libya, and involvement in an attempt to kill a former interior minister in 2013, a military statement said.
Ashmawy led the Sinai-based Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, Egypt's most active militant group, before it pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014, it said.
The other 36 defendants tried with him were also convicted of terrorism charges, the court ruled.
Their cases were referred to the Grand Mufti, Egypt's highest Islamic legal official. Egyptian law requires any capital sentence to be referred to him for an opinion before executions can take place.
The court set a new session for March 2 to confirm the convictions after receiving the Mufti's non-binding opinion.
In November, a military court had already sentenced Ashmawy to death in another terrorism case. Egyptian civilian and military courts had also sentenced Ashmawy to death in absentia before his extradition."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The number of deaths from a coronavirus epidemic in China has risen by 46 to 259, the country's health authority said on Saturday, as the United States and other nations announced new border curbs on foreigners who have been in China.
The central province of Hubei, the center of the epidemic, is under a virtual quarantine, with roads sealed off and public transport shut down. Elsewhere in China, authorities have placed restrictions on travel and business activity in a bid to contain the spread of the virus.
In its latest figures, China's National Health Commission said there were 2,102 new confirmed infections in China on Friday, bringing the cumulative total to 11,791. Around two dozen other countries have reported confirmed cases of the virus.
Amid growing international concern, Singapore and the United States announced measures on Friday to restrict entry to foreign nationals who have recently been in China.
Australia followed suit, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying the country will deny entry to all foreign nationals traveling from mainland China from Saturday.
""We're in fact operating with an abundance of caution in these circumstances,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney. ""So Australians can go about their daily lives with confidence.""
However, the World Health Organization, which this week declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, reiterated global trade and travel restrictions were not needed.
""We would want countries to focus on the mitigation efforts of identifying the possible importation of cases and responding to any domestic outbreak,"" China WHO representative Gauden Galea told Reuters on Saturday.
Qantas Airways Ltd and Air New Zealand said international travel bans had forced them to suspend their direct flights to China from Feb. 9.
All three major U.S. airlines said on Friday they would cancel flights to mainland China.
Nearly 10,000 flights have been suspended since the outbreak of the new coronavirus, according to travel and data analytics firm Cirium, illustrating concerns about a slowdown in economic activity in China and elsewhere.
EVACUATIONS
Many nations have put on special charter flights to repatriate citizens from China.
More than 300 South Koreans arrived home on Saturday on a second charter flight from China and have been transported to a facility where they will be isolated for two weeks, the health ministry said. Seven people on the flight exhibited symptoms and were sent to hospital.
Indonesian officials said around 250 nationals being evacuated from Hubei will be quarantined on a military base on the remote Natuna Islands.
Britain said it was withdrawing some staff from its embassy and consulates in China.
""In the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy and Consulates to provide assistance to British nationals from within China may be limited,"" the UK government said in a statement.
Infections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan, raising concerns that new hot spots are emerging despite strict travel restrictions.
In one of them, Huanggang, authorities are requiring households to designate one individual who can leave the home, a local newspaper said. The city has a population of about 7.5 million.
The northern city of Tianjin, with a population of about 15 million, suspended all schools and businesses until further notice, joining other cities across China in implementing measures aimed at curbing the spread of the pathogen.
A senior leadership group tasked with handling the crisis promised to take action to prevent a big surge in the number of people traveling after the extended Lunar New Year holiday.
The team led by Premier Li Keqiang said they would coordinate with local governments to stagger the times when people are asked to go back to work.
Although the WHO has praised China's efforts to contain the virus, the U.S.-based China Human Rights Defenders urged Beijing to ease restrictions on movement and counter discrimination against residents of Wuhan and Hubei.
""Human rights must not be a casualty of the government’s work to contain the coronavirus outbreak that has killed nearly 200 people and affected millions,"" the group said.
BUSINESSES, EVENTS DISRUPTED
Still, efforts to contain the virus have caused major disruptions and threaten to exacerbate a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy.
Growth had already slowed in the fourth-quarter to a 30-year low of 6%. But the impact of the virus prompted Capital Economics to almost halve its estimate for first-quarter growth to 3% from 5.7%.
China's central bank said the impact was temporary and economic fundamentals remained sound, but it would increase monetary and credit support, including lowering lending costs for affected companies.
The United Nations has announced it has moved a key round of talks on a new biodiversity treaty originally scheduled to take place in Kunming in southwest China on Feb. 24. The talks will now take place in Rome.
Several high-profile sporting events have also been moved or postponed, the latest a badminton Olympic qualifier in Hainan province.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Saturday it would close all of its official stores and corporate offices in China until Feb. 9, the latest of dozens of major companies, including Sweden's IKEA and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, restricting travel and operations due to the outbreak."

Ali Yousif Ahmed Al-Nouri, 42, is wanted in Iraq on charges of premeditated murder of the Iraqi police officers in 2006, according to a statement by the U.S. Attorney's Office District of Arizona.
An Iraqi judge issued a warrant for Al-Nouri's arrest and the government there issued an extradition request to the U.S. Justice Department, the statement said.
The Justice Department sought an arrest warrant for Al-Nouri and he was taken into custody on Thursday in Phoenix.
He appeared before a federal magistrate judge in Phoenix on Friday in connection with proceedings to extradite him to Iraq, the statement said.
According to the Iraqi government, al-Nouri was the leader of an al Qaeda group in Fallujah which planned operations targeting Iraqi police.
The statement noted the details in the Iraqi complaint were allegations that had yet to been proven in court.
Al-Nouri's extradition would have to be certified by the U.S. court and the U.S. Secretary of State would then decide whether to surrender him to Iraq, the statement said.
It was not immediately possible to contact Al-Nouri for comment or determine whether he had hired a lawyer.

Coppens, 25, a Belgian-Nicaraguan dual national, was a key figure in the anti-government street protests that swept across Nicaragua in April 2018 before being quelled by police and paramilitary forces. About 325 people died in the unrest.
Coppens spent seven months in prison after police raided a hideout used by protesters and activists in September 2018. She alleges she was punched and psychologically tortured in prison, while others were physically tortured.
Coppens became Nicaragua's most high profile street protester in detention after her case was highlighted by Belgium and the European Union. After her release she become a prominent activist and vocal critic of Ortega.
Nicaragua's government, which denies harming prisoners, charged Coppens with ""terrorism"" offences but freed her last June as part of an amnesty. 
Coppens, in an interview with Reuters, called for international groups to probe the government, which she said was ""violated and trampled"" the human rights of Nicaraguans.
""We are demanding that international organizations come to investigate what happened here,"" Coppens said in the capital Managua.
""The cases of torture are not isolated and continue to occur in prisons,"" she said.
The government did not respond to a request for comment.
Coppens was arrested again in November after bringing water to a group of mothers who were on a hunger strike to highlight their children's continued detention by the Ortega government. 

She was charged with firearms trafficking offences but the case was suspended on Thursday.

Trump was in Washington at the time, but was scheduled to leave for his Palm Beach resort later on Friday. 
The vehicle's driver, identified as Hannah Roemhild, 30, initially attracted police's attention for behaving erratically and dancing on top of her car at The Breakers resort in Palm Beach, county sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters. 
After police approached her she took off in a black SUV and was pursued by police through the town of Palm Beach at speeds in excess of 70 mph, at some point picking up the second woman, officials said. 
""This is not a terrorist thing,"" Bradshaw told a press conference, adding that Roemhild did not appear to have a police record and had a Connecticut driving license. ""This is someone who was obviously impaired somehow and driving very recklessly.""
Sheriff's deputies and Secret Service agents fired on the vehicle after it crashed through two checkpoints and approached a third on the outer perimeter of Mar-a-Lago at about 11:38, Bradshaw said.
""We didn’t know if it was someone with a car bomb or someone who was going to hit as many pedestrians as possible,” he said, adding that no-one was injured in the incident. 
In what appeared to be Roemhild's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, she identifies herself as an opera singer from Middletown, Connecticut. A January 2017 post on the page shows women protesters wearing pink hats, one holding a sign saying ""Not My President"" next to a picture of Trump. A June 2017 post shows a cartoon of Donald Duck turned upside down to resemble Trump.
Roemhild is likely to face charges of assault on a federal officer, deadly assault on a sheriff's deputy and various traffic charges for driving her car through the checkpoints, Bradshaw said. 

""There was clearly no intention,"" said Bradshaw, who declined to comment on a motive for Roemhild's actions. ""I'm not so sure she knew where she was going.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday relaxed Obama-era restrictions on the U.S. military's use of anti-personnel land mines, arguing that the previous policy could put American troops at a ""severe disadvantage.""
The move was criticized by arms control proponents and underscores the administration's willingness to upend policies set by Trump's Democratic predecessor, in the face of concerns about the dangers such weaponry poses to civilians long after conflicts end.
""The president's decision to roll back the policy on anti-personnel landmines is as perplexing as it is disappointing, and reflexive, and unwise,"" Senator Patrick Leahy said.
President Barack Obama's administration said in 2014 it would no longer produce or otherwise acquire anti-personnel land mines, including to replace existing U.S. stockpiles which can age to the point where the munitions can longer be used.
The United States had also prohibited the use of the weapons outside of the Korean Peninsula. 
In a statement, the White House said the Pentagon had determined the restrictions could put troops at a disadvantage.
""This policy will authorize Combatant Commanders, in exceptional circumstances, to employ advanced, non-persistent landmines specifically designed to reduce unintended harm to civilians and partner forces,"" the White House said.
The new policy, which was the result of a 2017 review started by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, will allow the military to use land mines that can self-destruct in 30 days or less and have a back up deactivation feature.
The Pentagon said there were no ""geographic limitations"" to where the land mines could be used.
Vic Mercado, who is performing the duties of assistant secretary of defense for strategy, plans and capabilities at the Pentagon, said the focus of the policy was on ""great power competition"" - referring to China and Russia. 
Mercado said land mine use would need to be authorized by a four-star military official and reviewed by the secretary of defense.
He spoke after Defense Secretary Mark Esper, speaking at a news conference with his Italian counterpart, said American forces needed access to land mines.
""Land mines are an important tool that our forces need to have available to them in order to ensure mission success and in order to reduce risk to forces,"" Esper said.
""That said, in everything we do we also want to make sure that these instruments, in this case land mines, also take into account both the safety of employment and the safety to civilians and others after a conflict,"" Esper added.
The United States is not a signatory to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which took effect in 1999 and broadly prohibits the development, use and acquisition of anti-personnel land mines.

Washington had abided by many provisions of the treaty, which had been endorsed by more than 160 countries

1656,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 06:08PM ET</span>",Brexit at last: Britain leaves the EU for an uncertain future,"By Kate Holton and Guy Faulconbridge
LONDON (Reuters) - The United Kingdom finally cast off from the European Union on Friday for an uncertain Brexit future, turning its back after 47 years on the post-World War Two project that sought to build the ruined nations of Europe into a global power.
In its biggest geopolitical shift since losing its global empire, the United Kingdom slipped away at 2300 GMT in a step cast by Prime Minister Boris Johnson as the dawn of new era.
Thousands of Brexit supporters gathered outside the British parliament, waving flags, singing and reveling in a mix of nostalgia, patriotism and defiance.
""This is a fantastic day,"" said Tony Williams (NYSE:WMB), 53, from south-east London. ""We are free, from 11 o'clock, we have done it ... We have done it.""
Brexit, once considered the unlikely dream of a motley crew of ""eurosceptics"" on the fringes of British politics, also weakens the EU, conceived as a way to bind together Europe's major powers in peace after centuries of conflict.
When the exit day finally came, after 3-1/2 years of wrangling since the 2016 referendum, it was an anticlimax of sorts: while Brexiteers waving flags toasted freedom in the rain, many Britons showed indifference or relief.
""For many people, this is an astonishing moment of hope, a moment they thought would never come,"" Johnson, the New York-born leader of the official ""Leave"" campaign, said in a pre-recorded address to the nation.
""Our job as the government -- my job -- is to bring this country together now and take us forward,"" said Johnson.
He celebrated in Downing Street with English sparkling wine and a distinctly British array of canapés including Shropshire blue cheese and Yorkshire puddings with beef and horseradish.
The EU's most powerful leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, cast Brexit as a sad moment that was a turning point for Europe. The EU warned that leaving would be worse than staying.
U.S. President Donald Trump has long supported Brexit. His Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Britons wanted to escape the ""tyranny of Brussels"".
In Brussels, the British flag was lowered at EU headquarters. Little will change immediately, however, as a transition period keeps the United Kingdom as a member in all but name until the end of 2020.
Brexit supporters young and old packed into Parliament Square (NYSE:SQ) to hear Brexit's other talisman, campaigner Nigel Farage.
""We are getting our independence back,"" Mark Leeds, a 39-year-old butcher, told Reuters beside parliament.
'INDEPENDENCE DAY'
Cast either as an epic opportunity or a grave mistake, Brexit has turned long-held views of Britain upside down just as the world grapples with the rise of China and the West's deepest divisions since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.
It also diminishes the EU. At the stroke of midnight in Brussels, the bloc lost 15% of its economy, its biggest military spender and the world's international financial capital, London.
Leaving was once a far-fetched idea: the UK joined in 1973 as ""the sick man of Europe"" and less than two decades ago British leaders were arguing about whether to join the euro.
But the turmoil of the euro zone crisis, fears about mass immigration and miscalculations by former Prime Minister David Cameron led to the 52% to 48% vote to leave in 2016.
For proponents, Brexit is ""independence day"" -- an escape from what they cast as a German-dominated project with a doomed single currency that is failing its 500 million people.
They hope departure will herald reforms to reshape Britain and propel it ahead of its European rivals.
UNCERTAIN FUTURE
Opponents say Brexit is a folly that will weaken the West, torpedo what is left of Britain's global clout, undermine its economy and ultimately leave it a less cosmopolitan set of islands.
David Tucker, 75, said he had come to London from Wales to march in the hope that others would keep alive the prospect of one day rejoining the EU.
    ""It is a tragedy,"" he said. ""We were once part of the world's most powerful economic bloc. Now we are just an inward-looking island that is going to get smaller.""
Johnson has promised to strike a broad free trade agreement with the EU, the world's biggest trading bloc, though Merkel and Macron have warned that leaving will be harder than staying.
But Brexit was always about much more than Europe. The referendum exposed deep internal divisions and triggered soul-searching about everything from immigration to empire and modern Britishness.
It has tested the very fabric of what now looks a disunited kingdom: England and Wales voted to leave but Scotland and Northern Ireland wanted to stay. The strains could hasten another referendum on Scottish independence and even a push for a united Ireland.
""We've had enough of the European Union, we don't want it,"" said Adrian Langshaw, 42. ""We want to be a sovereign nation and live as a British nation, make our decisions, make our rules and live how we want."""

They are part of an exodus that has shaken northwest Syria, the last rebel redoubt in the country's nine-year civil war, as hundreds of thousands push toward Turkey to escape a sudden and fast-moving advance by government forces.
Backed by heavy Russian airstrikes, President Bashar al-Assad's forces have recaptured dozens of towns since last Friday in a major campaign that has stoked tensions between Ankara and Moscow and raised the specter of a new refugee crisis. 
""We fled with just the clothes we were wearing because of the heavy bombing,"" said 55-year-old Sabri. His city Maarat al-Numan, the second biggest in Idlib, was re-captured on Tuesday in a major milestone for Assad's stated goal of reclaiming all of Syria.
At the camp outside Maarat Misrin, a northern Idlib town about 20 km (12 miles) south of the Turkish frontier, dozens of families sheltered in plastic white tents, many unsure of where they would wind up.
Jennah, 10, said it was the second time her family had been displaced. Like many others, they had sought refuge in Idlib after being ousted from other areas earlier in the war.
""I was forcibly displaced from eastern Ghouta, and then we went to Maarat al-Numan and the Syrian regime launched a military campaign on Maarat al-Numan, so we came here.""
A United Nations report on Thursday estimated that 390,000 people have fled northwest Syria from Dec. 1-Jan. 27, 80% of them women and children.
Moscow and Damascus say they are fighting jihadist militants who have stepped up attacks on civilians in Aleppo in northern Syria, but rights groups and rescue workers say air strikes and shelling have demolished hospitals, schools and homes.
Turkey, which fears a fresh wave of migrants piling into it territory, adding to the more than 3.6 million Syrians already there, said on Friday it would not tolerate new threats near its border and would act militarily if needed. 
Trucks crowded with civilians' furniture, mattresses and rugs were seen on Friday hauling out of towns across much of Idlib and western Aleppo, another area of northern Syria hit hard over the past week.

Michoacan's state security services, without giving names, said on Twitter that three people have been detained.
Mexican officials will be on high alert following the chaos in Culiacan last October, when cartel gunmen laid siege to the city and forced encircled security forces to free the detained son of jailed kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.
The bungled arrest of Ovidio Guzman was a huge embarrassment for President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is coming under increasing pressure to deal with spiraling violence that saw murder rates reach another all-time high in 2019.
Three policemen and one of the detainees were wounded during the arrest of Felipe, according to a source in the prosecutor's office.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft warned the Palestinians on Friday that bringing their displeasure with the U.S. peace plan to the world body would only ""repeat the failed pattern of the last seven decades.""
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will speak in the U.N. Security Council in the next two weeks about the plan, Palestinian U.N. envoy Riyad Mansour said on Wednesday, adding that he hoped the 15-member council would also vote on a draft resolution on the issue. 
However, the United States is certain to veto any such resolution, diplomats said. That would allow the Palestinians to take the draft text to the 193-member U.N. General Assembly, where a vote would publicly show how the Trump administration's peace plan has been received internationally.
Craft said that while the Palestinians' initial reaction to the plan was anticipated, ""why not instead take that displeasure and channel it into negotiations?""
""Bringing that displeasure to the United Nations does nothing but repeat the failed pattern of the last seven decades. Let's avoid those traps and instead take a chance on peace,"" she told Reuters.
Craft said the United States was ready to facilitate talks and that she was ""happy to play any role"" that contributes to the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan unveiled by U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday. 
Mansour said on Thursday: ""There is not a single Palestinian official (who) will meet with American officials now after they submitted an earthquake, the essence of it the destruction of the national aspirations of the Palestinian people. This is unacceptable.""

The countries have been at odds over the filling and operation of the $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), under construction near Ethiopia's border with Sudan on the Blue Nile, which flows into the Nile river.
The three regional powers convened in Washington for what were supposed to be two days of meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday to complete an agreement after talks earlier this month, but negotiations dragged into Friday and disbanded without a final accord.
In a joint statement with the United States and the World Bank after the talks, the nations said they had agreed on a schedule for staged filling of the dam and mitigation mechanisms to adjust its filling and operation during dry periods and drought.
The nations still have to finalize several aspects of the dam, including its safety and provisions for the resolution of disputes, the statement said. But it added that a final agreement on the dam would be signed by all three countries by the end of February.
""Documents to be signed will be further deliberated by legal team supported by technical team. This will continue next week to complete comprehensive document within 30 days,"" Sileshi Bekele, Ethiopian minister for water, irrigation and energy, said on Twitter.
The United States has hosted several rounds of talks in Washington with ministers from the three regional powers and the World Bank after years of trilateral negotiations failed.
U.S. President Donald Trump, in a call with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Friday, expressed optimism that an agreement on the dam was near and would benefit all parties involved, a White House spokesman said.
The dam is the centerpiece in Ethiopia's bid to become Africa's biggest power exporter but has sparked fears in Cairo that Egypt's already scarce supplies of Nile waters, on which its population of more than 100 million people is almost entirely dependent, would be further restricted.
Even without taking the dam into account, largely desert Egypt is short of water. It imports about half its food products and recycles about 25 billion cubic meters of water annually.

JEWAR, India (Reuters) - The 17-year-old boy left his home in a small north Indian town on Thursday morning after telling his grandfather he was going to school. Instead he turned up 80 km away in New Delhi, where he pulled out a gun and shot an anti-government protester.
The incident, captured in dramatic pictures on Thursday, was the first time a civilian had opened fire on protesters in the capital, raising fears that more Indians would take the law into their own hands as sometimes deadly protests rock the country.
A new law brought in by the Hindu nationalist government that fast-tracks Indian citizenship for non-Muslim minorities from three neighboring countries has divided opinion, with the Hindu majority and Muslim minority often taking opposing sides.
Family members, neighbors, and a school official in Jewar described the boy - who cannot be named under Indian law because he is under 18 - as quiet and ordinary. His act of violence took them by surprise.
In social media posts and conversations with some classmates, he spoke of restoring Hindu pride and expressed admiration for a right-wing activist whom police have accused of fomenting violence.
""He wanted to do things for Hindus, he had that in his heart,"" classmate Shivam told Reuters, giving only his first name. ""For years, he had said he was going to do something big.""
Reuters has not been able to establish how the boy planned the attack outside Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia university or how he acquired the rudimentary gun. He fired a single shot, wounding a protester in the hand.
WhatsApp messages with another classmate, seen by Reuters, show that he asked for several thousand rupees three days before the shooting incident, without revealing why.
UPHEAVAL AND DIVISION
Since December, when the citizenship law was passed, hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets, saying the legislation is anti-Muslim and against the spirit of India's secular constitution. At least 25 people have been killed in clashes with police.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says the law is designed to help persecuted minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
In recent days, some leaders from the ruling party have called for action against protesters opposed to the law, whom they accuse of being unpatriotic.
Junior finance minister Anurag Thakur this week encouraged supporters at a state election rally in New Delhi to chant slogans calling for traitors to be shot. He was reprimanded by Indian's election commission.
Hours after the shooting, small groups of people walked past the boy's house in Jewar, shouting Hindu slogans in support of his actions.
""What he did was unconstitutional, but we are with him,"" a neighbor said, declining to be named.
Hindus, Muslims and members of smaller religious minorities live cheek-by-jowl in Jewar, typical for towns and cities in Uttar Pradesh, Indian's most populous state.
DISBELIEF AND SOME ADMIRATION
Family members said the boy usually split his time between school and home, which adjoins his father's small sweet shop, and mostly kept to himself. In recent days, he had become even more withdrawn, spending a lot of time on his phone.
""We tried talking to him but we couldn't get him to open up,"" said his father.
""I'm still not able to understand what happened,"" added the boy's grandfather, wrapped under a blanket in their family home in a crowded lane dotted with shops and Hindu temples.
On his two known Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) accounts, which have been taken down by the company, he posted calls for Hindus to unite. Some posts featured him posing with weapons, according to a Reuters review of his profiles before they were removed.
Police, who are holding the boy in custody, could not be reached for comment on their investigation.
In March 2018, the boy asked friends via Facebook to join a meeting of the Bajrang Dal, a hardline Hindu group tied to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Days later, he shared photos of himself at the meeting.
Praveen Bhati, a local leader from the Bajrang Dal, denied the boy was a member of the group.
Some classmates said they were aware of his support for Hindu nationalism for at least three years, partly from his social media posts.
The classmates said he idolized right-wing activist Deepak Sharma, whom police accused of instigating violence against students from Afghanistan at a north Indian university in 2018.
At least two social media profiles of the boy - on Facebook, and WhatsApp - had Sharma in the main display picture.
Sharma said he remembered meeting the boy and recognized a photograph with him.

""I am not in touch with him,"" Sharma told Reuters, adding that he had quit activism.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States angered China on Friday with a warning to Americans not to travel there because of a coronavirus epidemic that has rattled the global economy with increasing disruption to business supply lines.
Originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the flu-like virus first identified earlier this month has resulted in 213 deaths in China. Wuhan and the surrounding region are in virtual quarantine.
More than 9,800 people have been infected in China and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions, with Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reporting their first cases on Thursday or Friday.
""Do not travel to China due to the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan,"" the U.S. State Department said, raising the warning for China to the same level as Afghanistan and Iraq.
Beijing, which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with Washington, responded sharply. It noted the World Health Organization (WHO) has commended Chinese containment efforts and not recommended travel or trade curbs.
""The World Health Organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the United States did the opposite,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. ""It's truly mean.""
Many other countries have also advised citizens to put off non-urgent travel to China. After reporting its first two cases of the illness, Russia on Friday restricted direct flights to China, its biggest trade partner.
Panama's canal authority said vessels that had passed through countries where coronavirus had been confirmed had to report that to authorities.
Singapore, a major travel hub in Asia, stopped entry of passengers with a recent history of travel to China and also suspended visas for Chinese passport holders.

GLOBAL REVERBERATIONS
With major fallout inevitable for China's economy, which is the world's second largest, global shares were heading for their biggest weekly losses since August on Friday. [MKTS/GLOB]
The outbreak could ""reverberate globally"", Moody's said.
In the latest impact to big name corporations, South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) said it planned to halt production of a sport utility vehicle this weekend due to a supply disruption caused by the outbreak. Sangyong Motor (KS:003620) said it would idle its plant in the South Korean city of Pyeongtaek from Feb. 4-12 for the same reason.
Home appliance maker Electrolux (ST:ELUXb) issued a similar warning.
French carmaker PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP) said its three plants in Wuhan will remain closed until mid-February.
After holding off as the crisis grew, the WHO said on Thursday that the epidemic did constitute a public health emergency of international concern, a designation that triggers tighter global containment measures and coordination.
However, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reiterated in a series of tweets on Friday that his organisation had confidence in China's capacity to control the 2019-nCoV virus.
""We would've seen many more #2019nCoV cases outside China by now, and probably deaths, if it were not for the government’s efforts and the progress they've made to protect their own people and the world,"" he tweeted.
""Travel restrictions can cause more harm than good by hindering info-sharing and medical supply chains and harming economies. We urge countries and companies to make evidence-based, consistent decisions.""

VIRUS EPICENTRE
The roughly 60 million residents of Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital, have had movements curbed to try and slow the spread of the disease. But some people were leaving and entering the area by foot on a bridge over the Yangtze river, a Reuters witness said, and infections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan.
Wuhan's Communist Party chief said the city should have acted earlier to contain the virus.
China's statistics show just over 2% of infected people have died, suggesting the virus is less deadly than the 2002-2003 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
But economists say its financial impact could be bigger than SARS, which killed about 800 people at an estimated cost of $33 billion to the global economy, since China's share of the world economy is now far greater.
The WHO has reported at least eight cases of human-to-human transmission - as opposed to people coming infected from China - in four countries: the United States, Germany, Japan and Vietnam. Thailand said it too had such a case.
Rising public alarm over the epidemic has brought a wave of anti-China sentiment abroad and led airlines to cancel or reduce flights, with airline crews pressuring carriers to act.
U.S. carriers Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and American Airlines (O:AAL) became the latest major airlines to suspend flights after the U.S. travel advisory.
Governments around the world are evacuating citizens from Hubei. A plane with 83 British and 27 foreign nationals landed in Britain on Friday, while the United States issued a quarantine order for 195 Americans evacuated to California this week. Japan, with 14 confirmed cases, has sent three flights to bring citizens home."

The U.S. State Department said it was taking the action against Paul Makonda, administrative chief of the Tanzania capital, ""due to his involvement in gross violations of human rights, which include the flagrant denial of the right to life, liberty, or the security of persons.""
It said Makonda had ""also been implicated in oppression of the political opposition, crack-downs on freedom of expression and association, and the targeting of marginalized individuals.""
The move bars Makonda and his immediate family members from visiting the United States.
The State Department declined say what specific action by Makonda brought about the designation, but expressed ""deep concern about deteriorating respect for human rights and rule of law in Tanzania.""
Makonda announced in 2018 that a special committee would seek to identify and punish homosexuals, prostitutes and online fraudsters in the city.
The U.S. embassy in Tanzania responded at the time by warning U.S. citizens in Tanzania to be cautious and to review their social media profiles and Internet footprints.
Tanzanian President John Magufuli cracked down on homosexuality after winning power in 2015, and a conviction for having ""carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature"" could lead to a sentence of up to 30 years in jail.
Under Magufuli, Tanzania has also tightened control of the media and civil society, shutting some newspapers, arresting opposition leaders and restricting political rallies.

PARIS (Reuters) - In a southeastern Paris district known as the go-to place for Asian cuisine, business is down at Pascal Corlier's Vietnamese restaurant, a side-effect of China's coronavirus health scare that has sparked panic and a rise in xenophobic incidents.
Some nervous customers have begun to ask waiting staff if they are Chinese, according to Corlier, whose Vietnamese father-in-law runs the kitchen and serves up traditional dishes like pho soup. Others are simply staying away.
""There's a sort of unfounded psychosis setting in around the Asian community and Asian food,"" the restaurateur said, adding that his revenues were down 40% for the first few weeks of 2020 compared to the same period a year ago.
The virus outbreak that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan has infected more than 9,800 people - mostly in China but with some 130 cases in 24 countries and regions outside mainland China, including six cases in France. It has killed 213 people in China and sparked a wave of travel curbs and other efforts to stop the spread, both inside China and abroad.
As well as Chinese nationals, France's big Asian community includes many people of Cambodian and Laotian descent, and one of the largest contingents of Vietnamese overseas -- a legacy of France's former colonial presence in south-east Asia.
Asians in France this week created a Twitter hashtag #Jenesuispasunvirus (""I am not a virus"") to signal abuse. Racist incidents, slights and slurs have been reported from the school playground to supermarkets, according to Laetitia Chhiv, who runs an association for young people of Chinese descent.
""We had a student of Chinese origin in Strasbourg who was shouted at by a woman who told him not to touch the avocados she wanted to buy,"" Chhiv said. ""That was after she asked him where he was from and whether he had the virus.""
Worries over the virus are reverberating across Paris in other ways too, with high-end stores that rely on Chinese tour groups hurting as the flow of visitors dries up. At some retailers, staff said French customers were also staying away, partly out of fear of mingling with Asian clients.
""Racism against Asians is spreading even faster than the virus,"" said Sun-Lay Tan, who works in the art world and is French-born of Chinese and Cambodian descent.
""I was sitting on the metro on my way to work and the person next to me edged a few centimeters away and put his scarf over his mouth. I was shocked.""
Corlier, the restaurant owner, whose wife is from Vietnam, said even his children had felt stigmatized and saw people covering their faces.
A Chinese teacher at a prestigious Parisian high school wrote to parents this week to explain she had not traveled to China in years, according to an email seen by Reuters.
""People are panicking, so it's hard to hold it against them,"" Corlier said. ""But they have to take a step back ... and look at the facts."""

LONDON (Reuters) - British politician Claire O'Neill will no longer serve as president of a major U.N. climate summit taking place in Glasgow in November and her replacement will be confirmed shortly, the UK government said on Friday.
""Preparations will continue at pace for the summit, and a replacement will be confirmed shortly,"" said a statement issued by the cabinet office. ""Going forward, this will be a ministerial role.""
O'Neill said on Twitter that she was ""very sad"" that the role she had been offered last year by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to lead the team overseeing the summit, which is known as COP26, had been rescinded.
""A shame we haven't had one Climate cabinet meeting since we formed. Wishing the cop team every blessing in the climate recovery emergency,"" O'Neill said.

The spokesman for the Iran-aligned group, Yahya Sarea, said the attacks, which were first announced on Thursday, were in response to air strikes carried out inside Yemen by a Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis for the past five years. 
The Saudi authorities have not confirmed the strikes, and the coalition has not responded to requests for comment.
If confirmed, the attacks would be the first by the Houthis on Saudi Arabia since late September, when the group which controls most urban centers in Yemen said it would halt missile and drone attacks if the coalition ended air strikes on Yemen.
That offer came after the Houthis claimed responsibility for a Sept. 14 attack on Saudi oil facilities that initially halved the kingdom's output. Riyadh rejected the Houthi claim and blamed Iran, which denied it.
After a lull in hostilities in recent months on many fronts, violence has escalated at the Nehm frontline, east of Yemen's Houthi-held capital Sanaa, since a Jan. 19 missile attack on a government military camp killed more than 100 people.
Sarea said the recent Houthi attacks had occurred between January 25 and 30, and the targeted airports were in Jizan, Abha, Najran and Khamis Mushait. 
The Yemen war, in which the United States and Britain back the Saudi-led coalition, has killed more than 100,000 people and pushed millions to the brink of famine.

DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - Latinos in Iowa, overlooked as a political force for years in the state that kicks off the U.S. presidential race, have been getting unprecedented attention in a too-close-to-call Democratic White House nominating fight.
The predominantly white state has seen the Hispanic share of its population more than double to 6.2% since 2000, making it Iowa’s biggest minority group and a crucial voting bloc that could spell the difference in Monday's state caucuses and in the November election.
The population growth has spurred many Democrats seeking the nomination to face President Donald Trump in November to hire Latino or Spanish-speaking staff and tailor some campaign events to court Latinos, while activists have scrambled to register new Hispanic voters and maximize their clout.
It has also changed the nature of life in some cities and towns in Iowa. In West Liberty, a small Hispanic-majority community with 3,700 residents, the school system has a dual-language program and some churches hold two services, one in English and one in Spanish.
""It has strengthened the town to have two cultures living and working together, with mutual respect, and it opens the door to more people moving here,"" said Brenda Arthur-Miller, the high school principal in West Liberty and director of the dual language program.
But the growth in Iowa's Hispanic population, a community largely of Mexican heritage, so far has not been matched by progress in its political power. Language barriers have hindered participation, particularly in the sometimes confusing caucuses.
Hispanic activists estimate as few as 3,000 Latinos participated in Iowa's 2016 presidential caucuses, out of more than 50,000 who were registered to vote.
To help remedy that, the state Democratic Party has agreed to at least five Spanish-language satellite caucus sites on Monday. Some local officials are scrambling to get interpreters in place at other locations.
The League of United Latin American Citizens, a Hispanic advocacy group known more commonly as LULAC, launched a registration drive it says has signed up 10,000 new Hispanic voters ahead of Monday's caucuses. It also held mock caucus sessions to spread the word on the process and help train potential voters on how they work.
""Our long-term goal is to keep doing the same thing through the November election and beyond. We want to keep the momentum going,"" said Nick Salazar, state director of LULAC and state co-chairman of the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign.
Salazar said the Democratic Party has sometimes taken the Hispanic community for granted.
""I'll be the first to admit that we have not done as much as we need to as a party to organize and emphasize the Latino vote,"" said Troy Price, chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, who said the party was trying to bolster its Hispanic appeal with new staff and programs.
The crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders has made up for it in this campaign, however, heavily courting Latinos in the state ahead of a general election campaign likely to be influenced by Trump's divisive rhetoric and policies on immigration.
For instance, the Sanders campaign, which has hosted more than a dozen ""Unidos con Bernie"" events around the state, created a Spanish-language digital ad featuring Sanders' father, who immigrated to the United States from Poland.
With the Hispanic population expected to more than double again by 2050, according to the State Data Center of Iowa, Salazar said the community was trying to build a tradition of civic engagement.
""When people think about rural Iowa they think of white farmers, but many of these communities will keep becoming more diverse and more Latino,"" Salazar said.

LAGOS (Reuters) - More than 1,000 motorcycle taxi drivers marched to the gates of the Lagos state legislature on Friday to protest against a measure that will bar them from much of Nigeria's traffic-choked commercial capital.
The marchers, many of whom wore or carried motorcycle helmets, oppose a ban on commercial motorcycles known locally as okadas and three-wheeled motorized rickshaws called kekes from the city's streets.
The state government said the decision, which goes into force on Saturday, is necessary for safety and security.
The protesters denied they flout traffic rules and said they are an essential part of the economy in the teeming city of 20 million people that has huge traffic jams.
Many of them work for ride-hailing apps Gokada and Max.ng, which have called the ban an attack on poor people as many of the riders have few other employment options.
""If they ban the bikes I won't be able to pay my rent or my children's' school fees. I'm a graduate. I went to school but there are no good jobs in the country so I need to do this one to help myself and my family,"" Chigozie Bright, a 33-year-old driver who started with ride service App Gokada last year.
Some of the marchers carried signs saying ""Regulate Us - Not Kill Us"" and shouted the slogan as they went, but there were no signs of violence.
Protesters said they would not disobey the ban by offering rides on Saturday, and hoped that customers would lobby for the ban to be lifted once they were left without rides.
Obiorah Obiorah, who watched the march from a car, said he relied on okadas and kekes, and opposed the government's move.
""To put a blanket ban is not proper because the roads are bad, totally bad,"" he said.
The state government said in a tweet that the okadas and kekes were dangerous and the drivers needed to learn ""trades we used to be proud of"" such as bricklaying, printing or tailoring."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The number of Americans booking flights to Brazil has jumped 39% since the government of President Jair Bolsonaro waived a visa requirement for U.S. citizens in June, according to its official tourism agency, which is devising plans to draw more.
""Brazil is much more than the land of caipirinhas and tiny bikinis. We want to focus on ecotourism and our vast natural resources, from the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest to the Pantanal wetlands,"" Embratur President Gilson Machado told Reuters on Thursday.
Machado said he spoke to U.S. airlines last week about adding direct flights to more cities in Brazil.
With an annual budget that was increased by Bolsonaro to $120 million from just $8 million, Embratur will launch a publicity campaign to sell Brazil as a new country - and a much safer one.
Violent crime in Brazilian cities dropped by 25% in Bolsonaro's first year in office and public security has been reinforced at tourist hot spots, Machado said.
Safety concerns, along with inconvenient flights, poor infrastructure and high costs have long held back Brazil's tourism industry. International tourism represents just 2.5% of Brazilian export revenue — compared with 7.5% in Argentina and nearly 17% in Uruguay, according to World Bank data and the United Nations World Tourism Organization.
Brazil eliminated tourist visa requirements for visitors from the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan in June and is planning to do the same for India and China to boost tourism.
Embratur hopes to turn Brazil into a global scuba diving destination, with 1,200 old boats, vehicles and planes to be deposited in the sea to create artificial reefs.
Machado will also work on Bolsonaro's pet project, which has drawn ire from environmentalists: developing a ""Brazilian Cancun"" in Angra dos Reis, a bay near Rio de Janeiro dotted with more than 300 islands and hundreds of pristine beaches.
Machado said it would require removal of ""excessive bureaucracy"" to clear local and federal environmental hurdles.
Another proposal to draw more American visitors is financing a feature film that would broadcast Brazil's natural beauty, he said."

Philip Jacobson, had been detained 45 days earlier in Palangkaraya, the provincial capital of Central Kalimantan in Borneo island, according to a statement from environmental news provider Mongabay.
His detention was criticized by rights groups who said it raised concerns over media freedom in the world's third-biggest democracy.
Arvin Gumilang, a spokesman for Indonesia's Immigration Directorate General, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Jacobson had entered Indonesia using a business visa for a series of meetings, the statement said. On the day he was due to leave, immigration authorities confiscated his passport and later ordered him to remain in the city pending an investigation, it added.
Immigration said he should have been on a journalism visa and formally arrested him on Jan. 21. His lawyer Aryo Nugroho and Mongabay said his meetings there did not constitute journalism.
Under Indonesia's immigration law, Jacobson could have faced up to five years in prison. But after an outcry from activists and widespread media coverage, Indonesia's chief security minister Mahfud MD said the journalist would be deported.
On his release, Jacobson said: ""It’s good to be out of prison and I’m relieved the prospect of a five-year jail sentence is no longer something I have to contemplate.""
Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch, said visa violations should not be treated as a criminal act. 
""It's tragic that an American environmentalist who dedicated his energies to protecting Indonesia’s rain forests and indigenous people has been treated so poorly,"" Harsono said.
In his role at Mongabay, Jacobson has worked on environmental stories including some containing allegations that companies in Indonesia used falsified permits to clear out a vast area of rainforest in the easternmost region of Papua."

KIEV (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo emphasized Washington's support for Ukraine on a visit to Kiev on Friday, as both countries sought to smooth over relations buffeted by the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. 
Ukraine was thrust into a domestic political battle in Washington last year as Trump faced allegations he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the son of his Democratic rival Joe Biden.
Pompeo has also walked back from comments he was accused of making to a National Public Radio reporter before his trip that appeared to play down Ukraine's importance to Americans.
Pompeo is the highest-ranking U.S. official to travel to Ukraine since the impeachment began. His visit comes as Trump's impeachment trial was set for a climactic vote on Friday or Saturday that is likely to acquit the president. 
After meeting Zelenskiy, both men played down the fallout from impeachment. 
""Today I'm here with a clear message: the United States sees that the Ukrainian struggle for freedom, democracy and prosperity is a valiant one. Our commitment to support it will not waver,"" Pompeo said. 
Ukraine counts on Washington for diplomatic support, sanctions on Moscow and military aid to buy Javelin anti-tank missiles and other hardware as it battles Russian-backed fighters in a war that has killed more than 13,000 people.
Trump had frozen nearly $400 million in U.S. security assistance shortly before speaking to Zelenskiy in a July phone call, prompting accusations from Democrats he had misused U.S. foreign policy for personal gain. 
Trump's camp has called on Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma. 
Impeachment overshadowed the first months of Zelenskiy's presidency, and he has voiced frustration about being constantly asked about it. He has repeatedly denied being pressured by Trump to launch investigations.
""I was wondering when this question would come up. When we speak with the USA, there is always a question about the impeachment of President Trump,"" Zelenskiy said on Friday, when asked whether impeachment had spoiled bilateral ties.
""It seems to me honestly that, on the contrary, there are very good relations between our countries, not just in words. The U.S. supports and defends Ukraine.""
Pompeo also denied suggestions that Zelenskiy would only be granted a visit to the White House to meet Trump if Ukraine agreed to announce investigations into Hunter Biden and Burisma. 
""No, there's no condition of the nature you described for President Zelenskiy to come to Washington and have that visit,"" Pompeo said in response to a question. ""We'll find the right time. We'll find the appropriate opportunity.""
Asked before the trip whether he would raise Burisma or the Bidens with Ukrainian officials, Pompeo had said: ""I don't want to talk about particular individuals."" 
Democrats had hoped to hear from former National Security Adviser John Bolton as a witness in Trump's impeachment trial, but they do not appear to have enough support from Republicans to bring witnesses to the proceedings. 
A report, which Bolton has not denied, said Bolton had written in an upcoming book that Trump told him he wanted to freeze military aid to Ukraine until it investigated both Bidens. 

Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Argentine President Alberto Fernandez said Pope Francis had promised him in a meeting to do everything he could to help with his homeland's debt crisis.
Fernandez, who was sworn in last month, met Francis privately for about 45 minutes in the papal library.
""The pope is helping us a lot and I appreciate it because he is an Argentine worried about his homeland,"" Fernandez told reporters. ""The pope is going to do everything he can to help us.""
The 60-year-old center-left president has promised to bridge social divisions and roll out a massive credit system with low rates to bolster domestic demand, and to boost spending to address hunger and poverty.
His administration has said it needs to restructure $100 billion in sovereign debt with its creditors, including the IMF, amid a steep recession and inflation of more than 50%.
Next Wednesday, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman are due have a meeting on the debt on the sidelines of a conference at the Vatican.
A Vatican statement said Fernandez and the pope had discussed the economic crisis, poverty, corruption and drug trafficking.
Fernandez shares many of the pope's ideas on social justice and quoted the pontiff repeatedly in his inaugural address last month.
In the public part of the meeting, Francis asked him to be ""a messenger of peace"" in their common homeland.
Francis has not visited Argentina since becoming Latin America's first pope in 2013. Fernandez said he there was no need to issue a formal invitation because the pope could go home whenever he wanted.

Perhaps as a nudge to return, Fernandez gave him two coffee table books about the most famous cafes of the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires.

""I want to move them (her two children) to a place where people have better mentalities, where there is education,"" said the 36-year-old resident of the Ard Al Lewa district, where rows of apartment blocks rise above dusty, unpaved streets.
""Unfortunately, things are very difficult in places like this...so I hope to be able to live to a good social standard.""
Egypt's 100 millionth person is expected to be clocked up on the official statistics agency's digital counter in central Cairo in February.
The newborn will join a nation where six people in ten are under 29 years old, said Aleksandar Bodiroza, representative of the U.N. populations fund in Egypt.
Many Arab and African countries are struggling with rising populations. But in Egypt the pressures are acute, because 97% of its people live on just 8% of its territory, crowded along the Nile, Bodiroza added.
Creating new space for housing, schools and hospitals is a priority as Egypt's population grows by 2.5 million people a year, he said. In inhabited areas, 1,400 people are packed into every square kilometer.
GROWTH FOR JOBS
The biggest problem is jobs. The workforce will reach 80 million within 10 years, the World Bank says.
But to create enough jobs, annual economic growth needs to be at least triple the population growth rate, said Radwa El-Swaify, head of research at Pharos, a Cairo financial firm.
Based on population growth of 2.5% this would require 7.5% GDP growth, compared with the government's forecast of up to 5.9% for the current fiscal year.
In addition, Egypt's economy could be hit by water shortages caused by climate change and a Nile dam being built upstream by Ethiopia. Infrastructure, including roads and public transport, will also come under pressure as the population grows.
""Thirty years ago this whole area was agricultural land,"" said Nabil Rawash, 60, who also lives in Ard El Lewa.
""But with the overcrowding and population growth, people started coming here to build,"" he added, standing in a street packed with people and cars.
NEW CITIES
Officials say they have managed to bring down fertility rates thanks to a ""Two is Enough"" campaign challenging the tradition of large families in rural areas.
This is aimed at more than 1.1 million poor families with up to three children. The Social Solidarity Ministry has trained volunteers to encourage people to have fewer children.
""During 2019, we have conducted 2,680,000 home visits,"" said Desiree Labib, project director at the ministry. ""Among these visits 407,000 women have asked to be referred to family planning clinics.""
She pointed to a U.N. study which found the fertility rate dipped to 3.1 in 2018 from 3.5 in 2014.
""If we apply more discipline, so that families have less children, we can reach fertility rates of 2.1 by 2032,"" said Abdelhamid Sharaf El Din, a senior statistics official.
That still means the population will grow to 153 million by 2052, but if the fertility rate were 3.4 it would hit 191 million, he said.
Either way, the government needs to do something about congestion in Cairo, home to about one in five Egyptians. It is planning to start moving ministries as soon as June.
But for many, moving there is not an option due to lack of transport and jobs, said Timothy Kaldas, non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.

""The over-centralization of Egypt's state and economy has led to this overwhelming concentration of Egyptians in one metropolis,"" he said.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, backed by Russian air power, have made rapid advances in Idlib, the last major rebel-held stronghold in Syria's nearly nine-year war, in an offensive which has displaced hundreds of thousands of people.
The recent campaign has also raised tensions between Ankara and Moscow, which back opposing sides in the conflict.
Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million refugees from Syria, fears a fresh wave of migrants from Idlib. It has 12 military observation posts around Idlib, set up under a 2017 agreement with Russia and Iran, and several of them have since been surrounded by advancing Syrian government forces.
Erdogan accuses Russia of violating agreements to reduce the fighting in Idlib, a charge Moscow denied on Friday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Idlib was a haven for militants targeting Syrian troops and a Russian airbase in Syria.
Speaking in Ankara, Erdogan repeated Turkey could not handle a fresh influx of migrants and would not allow new threats near its borders, even if it meant resorting to military power as it did in three previous cross-border operations in northern Syria.
""We will do what is necessary when someone is threatening our soil. We will have no choice but to resort to the same path again if the situation in Idlib is not returned to normal quickly,"" Erdogan said.
He also appeared to hold out the option of another operation in northeastern Syria, where in October Ankara targeted the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia that it calls a terrorist group.
""We will not refrain from doing what is necessary, including using military force,"" he said, adding Turkey wants stability and security in Syria. 
Later on Friday, the Kremlin said Russia was fully compliant with its obligations in Idlib, but that it was deeply concerned about what it said were aggressive militant attacks on Syrian government forces and Russia's Hmeimim air base.
Turkey, which has backed rebels fighting to oust Assad, has repeatedly called for Assad to step down, even while Iran, Russia and Turkey have said they seek a political solution to the conflict. 

""We will not allow the regime to put our country under the constant threat of migrants by tormenting, attacking, spilling the blood of... its people,"" Erdogan said.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 08:49AM ET</span>",Turkey's Erdogan criticizes Arab silence over U.S. Middle East plan,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Friday criticized Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab nations for not speaking out against the U.S. Middle East plan which he said endorsed the Israeli annexation of Palestinian lands.
Erdogan, who has positioned himself as a global champion for Muslim causes, said Arab nations' stance toward Palestinians was pitiable and countries that failed to speak out would be responsible for ""grave results"".
On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump proposed creating a demilitarized Palestinian state with borders drawn to meet Israeli security needs, granting U.S. recognition of Israeli settlements on occupied West Bank land and of Jerusalem as Israel's indivisible capital.
Turkey dismissed the plan as an attempt to steal Palestinian lands and kill off prospects of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
Despite Palestinians' rejection of the plan and their boycott of Trump, three Gulf Arab states - Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates - attended the White House gathering where Trump announced his plan.
""When we look at the stance of countries in the Muslim world toward this step and the announced text, I pity us. Saudi Arabia mostly, you are silent. When will you speak? The same goes for Oman, Bahrain, the Abu Dhabi leadership,"" Erdogan said in comments to members of his ruling party in Ankara.
""They even go and applaud it there. Shame on you,"" he added. ""Some Arab countries supporting such a plan are betraying Jerusalem, their own peoples and most of all humanity.""
Despite their historic support for Palestinians, some Arab powers have appeared to prioritize close ties with the United States and a shared hostility toward Iran over traditional Arab alliances.
Saudi Arabia expressed appreciation for Trump's efforts and support for direct peace negotiations under U.S. auspices, although state media reported that King Salman had called the Palestinian president to convey Riyadh's unwavering support.
Turkey's ties with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have been tense over a host of issues, from the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to rival policies in Libya.
Erdogan said it was ""inexplicable"" for Palestinians to be pressured into accepting the plan, adding that he would talk later on Friday to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the leader of the Palestinian militant group, Ismail Haniyeh.
Abbas will speak at the United Nations Security Council about the plan."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - When Palestinian leaders learned that the release of U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East plan was imminent, they swiftly announced a ""day of rage"" - a gritty, oft-used call for resistance against Israel.
But few demonstrators actually took to the streets despite Palestinians' broad rejection of Trump's proposal, a gap between rhetoric and delivery that exposes the scale of the challenge their leaders face in pressuring the United States and Israel.
As in past decades, critics are branding the Palestinians as naysayers, continually rejecting offers of a settlement in the hope, so far futile, of something better to come.
And domestic frustration with the Palestinian leadership has been building for years, with an ageing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas seeking a legacy but having dwindling scope to demonstrate progress toward his people's dream of freedom.
Contrary to expectations, Trump did propose a ""two-state"" solution for the conflict - but with strict conditions that would leave any future Palestinian state under near-complete Israeli security control.
Trump's endorsement of Israel keeping its settlements delighted right-wingers, who immediately urged the extension of Israeli sovereignty to nearly 30% of the occupied West Bank, which Israel captured in a 1967 war.

Palestinians say such moves would lead to apartheid. Israel rejects any comparison of its policies towards the Palestinians to South Africa's former system of legally-mandated racial segregation.
Analysts say that Palestinians face a difficult road ahead.
""They don't have good options. Responding positively to the Trump peace plan is impossible for any Palestinian leader. He would be seen as having sold out the Palestinian national cause completely,"" said Greg Shapland, a Middle East specialist at London's Chatham House think tank.
""(This) whole exercise seems to be structured in such a way that the Palestinians would have to refuse it and then the Americans can say to Israel and to the rest of the world, 'go ahead and do it' because the Palestinians are clearly not interested in peace,"" Shapland said.
That attack line has already been used by Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and principal architect of the plan.
""We're not going to chase the Palestinians,"" he told reporters. ""It will be very hard for them to play the victim card when they basically have a real deal on the table.""

INTERNATIONAL OPPOSITION
One avenue for Abbas, 84, is to use the United Nations to drum up international opposition to Trump's plan.
But Washington can veto any move in the Security Council. And even if Abbas wins support in the General Assembly it will have little more practical effect than a 2017 vote calling on Trump to drop his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
That secured 128 of 193 votes in support of the Palestinian argument, but was only a rhetorical show of support.
Abbas will also try other routes. On Saturday he travels to Cairo for a meeting of the Arab League, where he will engage regional allies.
But many Arab states rely on U.S. military aid or financial backing. And most are led by Sunni Muslim administrations that are aligned with the United States and Israel in confronting Iran's revolutionary Shi'ite theocracy.
Diana Buttu, a former legal adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization, said it was important to ""hold the (Arab) states who were part of this charade to account"" but that it wasn't likely to strengthen the Palestinians' hand.
""A better strategy is to begin to hold Israel accountable, whether it's through sanctions or legal (moves),"" she said.
One such legal move is at the International Criminal Court, whose chief prosecutor is seeking an investigation into alleged war crimes in the Palestinian Territories.
The court is still deciding if it has jurisdiction. Israel says the court has no jurisdiction to investigate the Palestinian Territories."

Christian Saunders, head of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), asked about the U.S. plan which would not allow a right of return to Israel, said that this right was ""enshrined in international law and various (U.N.) General Assembly resolutions""

1679,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 07:13AM ET</span>",Hong Kong leader rejects calls to close border despite virus fears,"By Felix Tam and Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam rejected calls from a medical union on Friday to close the border with mainland China to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, and urged health staff not to go through with a threatened strike.
The recently formed Hospital Authority Employees Alliance said earlier on Friday 6,500 of its members would go on strike if the frontier stayed open, a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a global emergency.
The WHO recommended all countries try to prevent or reduce cross-border spread of disease, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. But it said measures should avoid unnecessary interference with trade or travel.
""I am afraid (closing the border) contradicts the WHO suggestion ... which asks governments not to take any measures that may fuel discrimination,"" Lam told a news conference.
She announced a raft of new measures against the disease and said any industrial action by medical staff would only make the situation worse.
""At the end of the day those who will suffer will be our Hong Kong citizens and the public health system,"" she said.
Authorities have announced 12 confirmed infections in Hong Kong but no deaths. The number of confirmed cases in China has risen beyond 9,800, Beijing's envoy to the United Nations in Vienna said, and 213 people have died, all in China.
Lam said that on Jan. 30, only 9.7% of arrivals into Hong Kong, excluding those at the airport, were from mainland China, and most of the rest were returning Hong Kong citizens. She said she expected the flow to shrink as many mainland cities were under lockdown.
About 37,000 Hong Kongers crossed the mainland border the other way into China that day, she said.
NEW MEASURES
The health scare comes after months of often violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong triggered by fears its high degree of autonomy, guaranteed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, is being eroded by Beijing. The central government denies meddling.
Protesters frustrated by the government's refusal to make concessions on demands for full democracy have in recent months formed about 40 unions to keep up the pressure on the authorities.
In a news conference earlier on Friday, Winnie Yu, the chairwoman of the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, said its members may go a strike next week unless the border was closed. Other new unions have pledged support.
Lam had previously ordered the suspension of the high-speed rail service between the city and mainland China and all cross-border ferry services, but the unions said it was not enough.
The new measures announced on Friday included checks on people's temperatures as they left Hong Kong.
Lam extended school holidays until at least March 2 and said civil servants not providing urgent or essential services would work from home next week in an arrangement which will be reviewed weekly.
She urged private sector employers to do the same.
Immigration officials have identified 48 visitors from China's Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, and said they will either leave the city or be quarantined."

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary will begin an ambitious prison-building program in an attempt to stem a tide of costly lawsuits by inmates complaining of overcrowding and inhumane conditions, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday.
Orban accused ""business-savvy lawyers"" of exploiting the conditions to launch 12,000 lawsuits against the Hungarian state for breaking EU prison standards, leading to penalties of 10 billion forints ($33 million) in total.
""I have never seen such prison business in my life,"" he told state radio MR1. ""It's mind-blowing.""
Orban, who has often come under fire from the European Union and rights groups over his perceived erosion of the rule of law since he took power in 2010, announced plans for more prisons to reduce the prison overcrowding and disarm ""malignant lawyers"".
Last week, Orban drew criticism from top lawyers for suggesting his government would disobey court orders to pay compensation over the inhumane treatment of prisoners. The government later signaled it would pay the fines.
Orban also raised eyebrows by refusing to pay a fine of 100 million forints to a Roma community in Gyongyospata, eastern Hungary, which had sued the state because of illegal segregation in the local school.
On Friday, Orban said the school's move to separate Roma students had been an attempt to stem an exodus of students caused by what he said was the unruly and often violent behavior of the local Roma minority.
""Non-Roma in Gyongyospata began to feel that they had to back down and apologize, despite being the majority,"" Orban said. ""They feel like they are in a hostile environment in their own homeland.""
Orban's populist rhetoric on ethnic minorities, the rule of law and civic liberties led the European People's Party, the EU's conservative umbrella group, to agree on Wednesday to extend his Fidesz Party's suspension from the group.
Orban has several times threatened to leave the EPP, saying it has lost touch with conservative voters and demanding a return to a tougher stance on issues like migration and cultural identity."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Poland, Bulgaria and other eastern European Union states are mulling a legal challenge to new road transport rules that would force their trucks to return home every eight weeks, a change they say would harm their trucking companies, diplomats said.
The overhaul of trucking rules is promoted by their wealthier peers, including France and the Netherlands, and the dispute cuts to the core of the east-west divisions undermining the bloc's unity that has already been tarnished by Brexit.
Poorer countries on the EU's eastern flank want to benefit by offering services at lower prices to expand their economies and catch up on growth after decades behind the Iron Curtain.
Their lorries and drivers criss-crossing the EU, France and others worry that the practice undercuts their own workers.
Most EU countries agreed last December to reform the EU's road transport sector, including to give truck drivers working abroad the right to return home every three to four weeks, stipulating that their weekly rest of at least 45 hours must be spent outside of the vehicle and not in parking areas, and that employers must pay for accommodation.
The new laws would also force trucks involved in international transport to go back to their company's headquarters every eight weeks, a move designed to fight against a practice of registering transport firms in countries with lower taxes without actually running their operations there.
But Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Malta and Cyprus were against, according to diplomatic sources. They want changes to the new rules, which are expected to be discussed by the European Parliament in coming months.
""A group of like-minded countries needs to see changes to this eight-week rule. We shall see how further talks go, or else may be forced to challenge that in the courts,"" a senior EU diplomat told Reuters this week.
""It undercuts our companies heavily. If we have no other choice, we will sue at the European Court of Justice,"" said a second diplomat from the vexed countries, referring to the EU's top court.
The easterners say returning empty trucks is economically damaging for their companies, as well as leaving a heavy carbon footprint at a time when the bloc is seeking to curb greenhouse gas emissions to help combat climate change.
The westerners, on the other hand, see current practices in the road transport sector as social dumping - the practice of moving operations to countries with lower wages, taxes or workers’ rights."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Talks will resume in early March between representatives of the Thai government and the main insurgent group fighting for independence in the country largely Muslim-Malay south, the head of the government team on Friday.
The conflict in the Malay-speaking region of predominantly Buddhist Thailand has flared on and off since the area was annexed by the Thais in 1909, with the latest round that started in 2004 killing some 7,000.
Kuala Lumpur last week hosted a meeting between Thai officials and envoys of the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN), which observers say controls the majority of fighters on the ground and which pulled out of peace talks in 2014.
General Wanlop Rugsanaoh, the head of the Thai dialogue team, said he was cautiously optimistic following the Malaysia talks.
""The first session was a meeting for trust-building ... and now it will be about the proposals from both sides,"" Wanlop told reporters. ""This (next meeting) will take place round early March.""
The general said the talk will only be between his team and the BRN for now with mediation from Malaysia. The process would gradually bring in other insurgent and civil society groups, he said.

Christopher Paul Hasson, 50, has been in federal custody since his arrest in February last year, when investigators found more than a dozen guns, hundreds of bullets and scores of Tramadol pills in his home in Silver Springs, Maryland.
Prosecutors have labeled him a terrorist and a white supremacist, saying he made a list of people to shoot that included U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. They have asked Judge George Hazel of the U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland, to sentence Hasson to 25 years in prison.
His lawyers said Hasson was not planning any attacks but rather was in the grip of a years-long opioid addiction that created ""significant mood disturbances,"" according to a letter they wrote this month to the judge.
""Like many Americans, Mr. Hasson went through a difficult time in mid-life, when he became addicted to prescription opioids,"" his lawyers wrote, saying he was taking three or four times the daily approved dose of Tramadol, a prescription-only medicine he ordered illegally online. ""His criminal conduct arose out of this addiction.""
They asked that Hasson be sentenced only to the time he has already served in prison and three years of supervised release.
In their sentencing memo for the judge, prosecutors quoted racist emails and draft documents they said Hasson had written on his computer in which he repeatedly advocated a violent race war.
""Much blood will have to be spilled to get whitey off the couch,"" one typo-filled draft document said, which prosecutors described as a signed manifesto Hasson wrote in June 2017. ""Have to take serious look at appropriate individual targets, to bring greatest impact. Professors, DR's, Politian's, Judges, leftists in general.""
Hasson spent about $12,000 over three years amassing illegally obtained firearms and unregistered gun paraphernalia, prosecutors said.
He pleaded guilty to three crimes in a plea agreement reached with prosecutors in October: possessing unregistered gun silencers, possessing firearms as an unlawful user of controlled substances, and illegal possession of a controlled substance.
Until stopped by his arrest, prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memo, Hasson ""intended to exact retribution on minorities and those he considered traitors."""
1684,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 06:16AM ET</span>",Where Democratic presidential candidates stand on 'Medicare for All',"By Joseph Ax
(Reuters) - Perhaps no issue has divided the field of Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls more than ""Medicare for All.""
Liberal candidates favor the sweeping proposal, which would replace private health insurance with a single government-run plan. Moderate candidates have embraced less drastic measures they say would achieve broader healthcare coverage while allowing individuals to choose their plan.
Here is where the top eight contenders stand on Medicare for All:
MEDICARE FOR ALL OR BUST
Bernie Sanders
The U.S. senator from Vermont authored Medicare for All legislation that would essentially abolish private insurance in favor of a single government-run plan that covers every American. The ambitious proposal would cost more than $30 trillion over 10 years, according to independent analyses.
Sanders has acknowledged he would impose higher taxes on families to help pay for the program, but has argued the typical middle-class family would save overall by eliminating virtually all health expenses.
The bill would transform Medicare - now primarily for Americans aged 65 and over - into a universal system and ban employers from offering healthcare plans to compete with the government. Aside from prescription drugs, patients would face no out-of-pocket costs when accessing medical services.
Several Democratic rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden, have criticized Sanders' plan as unrealistic.
Elizabeth Warren
Perhaps more than any other candidate, Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, has grappled with the issue of Medicare for All. After initially saying she was ""with Bernie,"" she released a detailed financial proposal in November with a price tag of $20.5 trillion in additional government spending over a decade.
Warren vowed to finance the plan with higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations while avoiding ""one penny"" more in middle-class taxes.
The idea was met with skepticism by some of her Democratic rivals, including Biden.
Warren subsequently released a transition plan. It would create a public option - similar, albeit more ambitious in scope, to that proposed by more moderate candidates like Biden. It would preserve private insurance for three years before fully implementing Medicare for All.
That proposal drew some criticism from the left, with Sanders supporters claiming she had backed down from her Medicare for All stance. Warren has said she remains committed to Medicare for All and that her plan would provide more coverage to more Americans in a shorter time frame.
PREFERRING A PUBLIC OPTION
Joe Biden
The No. 2 to Democratic President Barack Obama has criticized Medicare for All as an effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Obama's signature healthcare law.
Instead, Biden has vowed to ""build on"" the ACA, popularly known as Obamacare, by adding a public option that would leave the current private insurance system in place.
His healthcare plan, estimated to cost $750 billion over 10 years and paid for partly by higher taxes on the wealthy, would let people enroll in a paid government healthcare plan as an alternative to private insurance. The government plan would be modeled on Medicare and available even to workers with employer-provided policies.
The proposal would also expand the ACA's subsidies for private policies, making them more generous and extending them to more people.
Michael Bloomberg
The billionaire former mayor of New York, who entered the campaign in November and is skipping the first four state contests, released a healthcare plan in December that would create a public option but preserve the current system of private and employment-based insurance.
Bloomberg has advocated building on the ACA, rather than scrapping it in favor of a Medicare for All plan that he says is unaffordable. He has called for increasing subsidies to cover low-income families' premiums.
His plan would cost $1 trillion in additional government spending over 10 years. Bloomberg's campaign aides have said he will release details on how he would finance it in the coming weeks.
Pete Buttigieg
Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, favors a public option, which would allow individuals to opt into a government plan but would preserve the existing role for private insurers.
Buttigieg, who coined the phrase ""Medicare for all who want it"" to describe the concept, has argued that a public option will eventually lead to a single-payer system because individuals will find that Medicare is more cost-efficient than private policies.
The plan would cost $1.5 trillion in additional spending over 10 years, according to the campaign. Buttigieg has said he would pay for the plan by rolling back President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts.
Amy Klobuchar
Klobuchar, a moderate U.S. senator from Minnesota, has said she would improve on the ACA by adding a public option that would be available through either Medicare or Medicaid, giving people the chance to choose a government-backed plan. She has called Medicare for All a ""pipe dream.""
She has said she would finance her legislation in part by raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans.
Tom Steyer
Steyer, a billionaire who entered the race in July, favors a public option that would allow Americans to choose a government-backed plan while expanding on the ACA.
His proposal would cost $1.5 trillion over 10 years, according to his campaign.
STAKING OUT A MIDDLE GROUND
Andrew Yang
Yang, an entrepreneur, has said he supports ""the spirit of Medicare for All."" He has argued that the prevailing job-based insurance system discourages businesses from hiring due to ever-rising costs, while forcing people to stay in jobs they dislike to protect their healthcare coverage. However, he has said he would not seek to ban private insurers.
He has bemoaned the amount of time that Democrats have spent debating Medicare for All and has focused instead on issues like lowering drug costs, improving technology and transitioning doctors from a fee-for-service model to a salary-based system."

CHASTEAUX, France (Reuters) - In a forested area in central France, a young couple lives off-grid in a wood-and-straw cabin. Their aim is not to hide from the law, but to change it.
Jonathan Attias, 33, and Caroline Perez, 34, are the driving force behind the ""Desobeissance fertile"" (Fertile Disobedience) movement that links up back-to-nature enthusiasts with landowners willing to let them build dwellings on their land.
Attias and Perez built a cabin on a three-hectare plot shared with them by an older friend. Two other people also live on the site.
""We want to show that it is possible for people to live with and in nature,"" said Attias, who gives legal and practical advice to people who want to live off-grid in cabins, yurts, tiny houses or other impermanent dwellings.
A year ago, the couple built their ""compostable"" house with wood, stone, bales of straw and recycled materials like tarpaulins and old doors. When they leave, the house will biodegrade naturally.
But in France, like most of Europe, people are not allowed to build housing in forests or on agricultural land, only in designated housing areas and where they must respect building codes.
Attias wants to change that.
""We will bring our case to the media and we want public debate, we want the law to change,"" he told Reuters.
His mayor disagrees.
""Everybody wants to change the law when it suits them. What they are doing is forbidden,"" said Jean-Paul Fronty, mayor of the village of Chasteaux, with 744 inhabitants.
Attias and Perez live in the woods by choice. Two years ago they were urban professionals in Paris. Attias still teaches at a Paris university two days a month and works as a freelance journalist. Perez is a doula who assists with childbirth.
They own a car, they have medical insurance and their four-year-old daughter goes to school in the village, a three kilometre walk from their cabin, which is heated with a cast-iron wood stove and powered by a solar panel.
Both vegetarians, they tend a big vegetable garden, but also get free unsold produce from a bio-store in the village. Water comes from a spring and is made safe with carbon filters.
""We are the guardians of the forest. We don't degrade our environment, we upgrade it,"" he said."

A 12-member jury returned to deliver their verdicts of not guilty in the early hours of Friday after about eight hours of deliberations, said prosecutors in the city of Ghent, where the trial was held.
The three accused, whose signatures were required for the procedure, were the doctor who administered the lethal injection, Nys's former general practitioner and a psychiatrist.
Nys's parents and sisters, who were present at her death, complained that the euthanasia was carried out in an amateurish manner and that Nys did not have an incurable mental disorder, an important condition for granting euthanasia.
Belgian law allows adults to request the right to die on condition that they are facing unbearable physical or mental suffering resulting from a serious and incurable disorder. It was extended to terminally ill children in 2014.
Most patients choosing medically assisted death have terminal cancer, but mental suffering has extended, for example, to twins born deaf and becoming blind who were unable to bear not being able to communicate with each other.
Supporters of euthanasia say the trial has made doctors in Belgium nervous about signing papers for patients or helping them die. Some patients, they say, are also anxious that they will not be able to die on their own terms.
In the Netherlands, where euthanasia is also legal, a doctor was acquitted in a trial in September after being accused of failing to secure proper consent from a woman who had Alzheimer's. Prosecutors there have since sought a Supreme Court ruling."

DAKAR (Reuters) - For Senegalese activist Fatou Warkha, online videos play a vital role in her campaign to expose and end violence against women in a country where discretion and forbearance are traditionally prized.
The 30-year-old grew up in Pikine, one of Dakar's poorer suburbs, where cases of domestic violence, rape and abuse were as commonplace as the district's power outages and seasonal flash floods.
After she failed to raise awareness through grassroots activism, Warkha launched an online television channel in 2018, hoping the anonymity offered by the internet and its reach might encourage women to open up after generations of silence.
""When I started making video reports, that was when it seemed like things started changing,"" Warkha told Reuters in her home in Pikine.
The project has sparked much-needed debate and helped bring about real change. Its videos of women or actors recounting true stories of trauma and abuse have been widely shared on social media and picked up by local television stations.
According to World Bank data, as of 2017 around half of the population of Senegal was using the internet.
Some of the videos played a role in a successful campaign for the criminalization of rape, which was signed into law on Jan. 10.[L8N29L3I7]
The channel http://www.warkhatv.com now plans to produce reports explaining the new law and how rapists and abusers can be held accountable, Warkha said.
Women need to ""know how to preserve the evidence so they can prove that a rape has happened,"" Warkha said. ""Other than that, more work needs to be done to raise awareness about the rights of women and children.""
Her mission to break the silence on society's ills runs counter to deep-rooted cultural mores such as 'Soutoura,' which means to be discrete in the local Wolof language, 'Massla' - to tolerate and compromise, and 'Mougne' - to endure.
In one of the channel's series, titled '16 voices, 16 victims,' a woman tells how as a child she watched her father beat her mother until she didn't get up. Another report details the murder of a young woman at university.
Funding is a challenge. The station sells its production services to cover the cost of making its own videos and receives some NGO support. Slow internet speeds and the power outages are also an issue.
These difficulties have not dented Warkha's belief in the importance of technology for activism.
""I often tell people that you can do great things with a just a mobile phone,"" she said in her living-room, where the power had been out for several hours."

Slovenia had argued that its fellow EU member could be sued under EU law because it was not implementing a 2017 border ruling by the intergovernmental Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.
The European Commission has said Croatia meets the technical criteria for Schengen membership, but Slovenia is unhappy with Croatia's rejection of the ruling, and has the power to veto its accession.
""The Court of Justice of the European Union lacks jurisdiction to rule on a border dispute between Slovenia and Croatia,"" the court said, adding that the two states were required to find a solution between themselves.
The two Balkan countries have argued for years about the course of their land and sea border at Piran Bay on the Adriatic Sea."

LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuters) - Frustrated by one of the world's highest rates of sexual assault, poor law enforcement and tribal taboos that keep people quiet about gender violence, some Nigerian women are breaking with tradition to take self-defense classes.
A local rights group and boxing coach have joined to offer free training that is tearing the lid off the largely unspoken problem of everyday violence against women in a country already well known for atrocities against girls by jihadist fighters.
New student Adeola Olamide says she was filled with fear and shame when first assaulted. When the attacks continued, the petite 35-year-old mother-of-three decided to learn techniques needed to fight off a bigger, stronger opponent.
""For us, the idea of a woman learning to defend herself is revolutionary,"" said Olamide, who described having been choked and beaten several times in assaults.
""As a woman in Nigeria, you're not supposed to have a voice. Every tribe has this in common.""
She spoke minutes before stepping into her first class run by rights group Women Impacting Nigeria and coach Rehia Giwa-Osagie, head of local gym Elitebox.
Their hands wrapped and stuffed into boxing gloves, the students soon filled the gym with hissing sounds as they practiced jabs and uppercuts against heavy bags.
Boxing and karate instructors taught Olamide and about 20 other students basic blocking, striking and escape techniques in the two-hour class, which is offered monthly to any women willing to step out of their cultural comfort zone.
Nigerian media are awash with horrifying stories of women and girls kidnapped and trafficked for sexual and labor exploitation. And the abduction of 276 schoolgirls in 2014 by Boko Haram jihadists sparked global outcry.
But everyday assaults have stayed under the radar.
""RECLAIMING OUR DIGNITY""
Anietie Ewang, Nigeria researcher for Human Rights Watch, said law enforcement was inadequate. ""When this is coupled with the negative perceptions that reinforce injustices against women, it culminates in a pretty hostile environment.""
Coach Rehia said the classes were in a nascent stage but should help combat an ""enormous"" problem in Nigeria. Official national data on violence against women was not available, but an official at the Women's Affairs Ministry said the government was making a strong effort to combat the issue.
After her first session, Olamide's confidence grew.
""There's something about doing this with other women, reclaiming our dignity outside of a traditional therapeutic process,"" said the mother-of-three, still sweating. ""It's different from sitting in a circle and telling our stories.""
Nigeria is the ninth most dangerous country in the world for women, according to a 2018 report from the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The most dangerous was India.
""I had never heard of a women's self-defense workshop in Nigeria. It's just not done. But the #Me Too movement we've seen around the world has prompted people to ask how we can prevent violence,"" said Tope Imasekha, head of the rights group.
#Me Too was ignited by revelations in 2017 of assaults against women in Hollywood and became a global movement.
""Traditionally, we believe that we should be defended by men: our fathers, husbands and brothers. But with more women working and walking around independently, we need to defend ourselves,"" said Olamide's classmate Motunrayo Naiwo, 39.
Naiwo said she had been groped on the streets of Lagos, and seen other women accosted while men stand by watching.
""Now, with this training, even I might be able to help another woman if she's in trouble,"" she said."
1691,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 03:36AM ET</span>","Brexit day: Britain quits EU, steps into transition twilight zone","By Guy Faulconbridge
LONDON (Reuters) - The United Kingdom leaves the European Union on Friday for an uncertain Brexit future, the most significant change to its place in the world since the loss of empire and a blow to 70 years of efforts to forge European unity from the ruins of war.
The country will slip away an hour before midnight from the club it joined in 1973, moving into the no man's land of a transition period that preserves membership in all but name until the end of this year.
At a stroke, the EU will be deprived of 15% of its economy, its biggest military spender and the world's international financial capital of London. The divorce will shape the fate of the United Kingdom -- and determine its wealth -- for generations to come.
""This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson will say in a television address, though he has given few clues about his post-Brexit plans beyond inspirational words.
""This is the dawn of a new era,"" Johnson, one of the main leaders of the ""Leave"" campaign in the 2016, will say.
Beyond the symbolism of turning its back on 47 years of membership, little will actually change until the end of 2020, by which time Johnson has promised to strike a broad free trade agreement with the EU, the world's biggest trading bloc.
For proponents, Brexit is a dream ""independence day"" for a United Kingdom escaping what they cast as a doomed German-dominated project that is failing its 500 million population. 
Opponents believe Brexit is a folly that will weaken the West, torpedo what is left of the United Kingdom's global clout, undermine its economy and ultimately lead to a more insular and less cosmopolitan set of islands in the northern Atlantic.
DIS-UNITED KINGDOM
Brexit was always about much than Europe.
The June 2016 Brexit referendum showed a divided and triggered soul-searching about everything from secession and immigration to empire and modern Britishness.
Such was the severity of the Brexit meltdown that allies and investors were left astonished by a country that was for decades touted as a confident pillar of Western political stability.
At home, Brexit has tested the bonds that bind together the United Kingdom: England and Wales voted to leave the bloc but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay.
Scotland's First Minister will use the moment to spell out her next steps towards holding a second independence referendum with a poll on Thursday suggesting a slim majority of Scots would now back a split because of Brexit.
So on ""Brexit Day"", some will celebrate and some will weep -- but many Britons will do neither. Many are simply happy that more than three years of tortuous political wrangling over the divorce are over.
""I did not vote for it and I did not want it to happen, but now I just want it over,"" said Judith Miller, a resident of London. ""I am tired, I have had enough, I am sick of it on the news and we are just going to have to deal with it.""
'NEW DAWN'
It is unclear how Brexit will play out for either the United Kingdom or the European Union. 
Brexiteers hope 'independence' will herald democratic and economic reforms that will reshape the United Kingdom, propelling it ahead of its European rivals which they say are chained to the doomed euro.
Pro-EU supporters say the United Kingdom will atrophy and have little option but to move closer to U.S. President Donald Trump. The Times newspaper showed a cartoon of Johnson leaping out the EU frying pan into the fire of Trump's orange hair.
Eurosceptic newspapers heralded the impending departure. 
""A New Dawn for Britain,"" the Daily Mail said on its front page and the Sun's headline was ""Our Time Has Come"". The pro-EU Guardian had a different slant: ""Small island,"" its headline said, adding it was the biggest gamble in a generation. 
Johnson will chair a cabinet meeting in Sunderland, the first city to declare support for leaving the EU in the June 2016 referendum. Brexiteers will celebrate on Parliament Square (NYSE:SQ) while some opponents of Brexit are also due to gather.
A Union Jack in the building of the European Council in Brussels will be lowered at 7 p.m. time (1800 GMT) on Friday, and put away with the flags of non-EU countries. 
With sorrow, some support for Brexit and even hope of a return, Europeans from across the EU bade farewell.
""I am very sorry that the United Kingdom is exiting. I think it is a very, very bad thing for Europe, for the United Kingdom, for everything,"" said Sara Invitto, from Milan. ""Goodbye!""

EL ROSARIO, Mexico (Reuters) - Surrounded by the millions of monarch butterflies that Mexican environmental activist Homero Gomez fought to protect until his mysterious death, relatives and friends paid tribute to him on Thursday. 
Gomez's sudden disappearance two weeks ago had sparked an outcry in Mexico, an increasingly violent country where activists are routinely threatened, harmed or even killed as a result of their work.
The attorney general in the western state of Michoacan confirmed on Wednesday only that Gomez had drowned; the exact circumstances of his death remain unclear. 
Relatives and friends carried his coffin, covered in a Mexican flag and adorned with flowers, to the entrance of the El Rosario reserve, before moving through the streets of the village nearby and finally his home. 
Gomez had spent a decade working as an activist, though he became best known for posting mesmerizing videos of the black and orange insects on social media, urging Mexicans to treasure the El Rosario reserve, a world heritage side. 
Amado Gomez said his brother, an engineer, was so compelled to do something after the number of butterflies dropped dramatically that he eventually gave up his job to work on different projects aimed at protecting them. 
""This was his passion,"" said Gomez. ""He loved promoting the butterflies, filming them, researching them.""
In recent years, he had increasingly pushed for reforestation projects to save their habitat.
Gomez said his brother affectionately called them ""girlfriends of the sun"". 

Millions of the butterflies make a 2,000-mile (3,220-km) journey each year from Canada to winter in central Mexico's warmer weather. However, they are facing new challenges linked to extreme weather and changing habitat.

CIUDAD JUAREZ (Reuters) - Bewildered, sad and disappointed, Brazilians migrants sent from the United States to Mexico this week were left wondering how they had ended up in another country whose language they do not understand.
The United States on Wednesday began sending some Brazilian migrants who had crossed the border with Mexico back there to await their U.S. court hearings under a program known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).
It is one of several moves by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump aimed at reducing the number of people seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. Since the program began a year ago, more than 57,000 non-Mexican migrants have been returned to Mexico.
""I don't understand why I was sent here,"" said Brazilian migrant Tania Costa, adding that she did not understand Spanish and had been unable to communicate with Mexican officials. ""Why did they return me to Mexico and not Brazil?"" 
She said U.S. officials had not explained to her that she would be sent to Mexico. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ten Brazilian migrants were sent to Mexico under MPP on Wednesday, according to Enrique Valenzuela, who heads the civil protection services in Chihuahua state. The program was previously limited to Spanish speakers.
Among them were Costa and her six-year old daughter. They had left Belo Horizonte in the southwestern state Minas Gerais, Brazil just over a week ago, she said.
""I had heard of people who managed, so I tried as well,"" she said. ""I had a court date, everything was scheduled, but they didn't let me stay there."" 
She was getting death threats because of her inability to pay her debt, she said, and that she had no job. ""They said since we don't want to go back to Brazil, because we're being threatened, then we have to return to Mexico,"" she said.
U.S. Border Patrol caught roughly 17,900 Brazilians at the southwestern border with Mexico in the last fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, 2018. The figure was a sharp increase from 1,500 arrests a year earlier. 

""I would like to return to the United States,"" said Costa. ""They gave us a court date, but in April. And we have no way to get back to Brazil.""

DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump campaigned on Thursday in Iowa - the state that kicks off the presidential nominating race next week - basking in the support of his base while the U.S. Senate trial considering his impeachment continued in Washington. 
Reviving some of the most polarizing speech lines from his 2016 campaign and mocking his potential Democratic opponents, Trump regaled the crowd with a series of campaign promises, including revamping the U.S. healthcare system and continuing to build a wall along the country's southern border with Mexico.
Democratic contenders for their party's nomination to challenge Trump in the November election face their first electoral test in the Iowa caucuses on Monday. Trump, who is seeking a second term, is expected to easily win the Republican caucus. 
His campaign, regardless, is making a show of force in the state and several of his supporters, including both of his adult sons, will be in the state on Monday.
Trump's speech on Thursday was squarely focused on the general election. He won Iowa in 2016 and Democrats are not expected to invest many resources trying to flip it back to their column this year.
But Democrats have dominated the airwaves in Iowa for the past year, making Trump the focus of their appeals to the state's Democratic voters.
Trump repeated his criticism of his potential Democratic opponents, denigrating former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg for his height and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg for his last name, and repeating his reference to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas.” 
""Democrats stand for crime, corruption and chaos, Republicans stand for law, order and justice,"" Trump said. 
Trump renewed a 2016 campaign promise to make Mexico pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a vow he made daily while campaigning the first time but has rarely mentioned since taking office. 
""Illegal aliens from Mexico are going to pay for the wall ... through remittance, 100 percent,"" Trump said.
He also revisited a line from his 2016 campaign, maligning some migrants trying to enter the United States as criminals.
Fresh from signing a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada on Wednesday and a separate pact with China earlier this month, the president said the Democrats would be bad for Iowa’s farmers - warning they would ""kill your cows.""

""If we don't win, your farms are going to hell,"" he said.
