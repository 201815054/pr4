SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean troops shot dead a South Korean fisheries official who went missing earlier this week, before dousing his body in oil and setting it on fire in what was likely an effort to prevent a coronavirus outbreak, South Korea's military said on Thursday.
South Korea's military said evidence suggested the man was attempting to defect to the North when he was reported missing from a fisheries boat on Monday about 10 km (6 miles) south of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), a disputed demarcation of military control that acts as the de facto maritime boundary between the two Koreas.

The exact reason the 47-year-old official was shot is not known but North Korean troops appear to have been acting under anti-coronavirus orders, South Korea's military said.
The presidential Blue House's national security office said the killing was a ""crime against humanity"", and called on North Korea to apologise and put measures in place to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents in the future.
Citing intelligence sources, the military said the unidentified man appeared to have been questioned at sea, north of the NLL and about 38 km (24 miles) from where he went missing, before he was executed on an ""order from a superior authority"". Troops in gas masks then doused the body in oil and set it on fire.
The military said it sent a message on Wednesday to the North through the land border demanding explanations, but has not received any response yet. 
""Our military strongly condemns such an atrocity, and strongly demands North Korea provide explanations and punish those who are responsible,"" General Ahn Young-ho, who is in charge of operations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a briefing.
CORONAVIRUS FEARS
The U.S. military commander in South Korea said this month that North Korean troops had been given ""shoot-to-kill orders"" to prevent the coronavirus entering the country.
Such strict enforcement of those orders may be an attempt to prevent an outbreak from disrupting a major military parade expected to be held on Oct. 10 when the country commemorates the founding of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, said Chad O'Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea.
""In many ways, this parade is a huge potential viral risk,"" he said in a post on Twitter. ""And it seems paranoia about that risk is at play (with) shoot-to-kill rules.""
In July, a man who had defected to South Korea three years ago triggered a coronavirus scare when he crossed back over the heavily monitored border into North Korea, which says it has had no cases of the disease.
His arrival prompted North Korean officials to lock down a border city and quarantine thousands of people over fears he may have had the coronavirus, though the World Health Organization later said his test results were inconclusive.

Last week, South Korean police arrested a defector who they said had tried to return to North Korea by breaking into a military training site in South Korea's border town of Cheorwon.

However, the size of the rally in Jakarta was far smaller than organisers had planned, with only a few dozen attending the protest outside parliament amid coronavirus restrictions.
The president, whose coalition controls 74% of parliamentary seats, has asked lawmakers to finish deliberations by this month or early October. 
The so-called ""omnibus"" bill aims to revise over 70 laws to improve the investment climate in a single piece of legislation.
But it has been attacked by unions because it aims to cut severance benefits and revise rules on outsourcing, among other proposals. Meanwhile, green groups say it could lead to ecological disasters by relaxing requirements for environmental studies.
Government officials have said current labour rules are too rigid and environmental rules would only be streamlined, while highlighting the urgency of fixing regulations to attract investment and create jobs for two million Indonesians entering the job market every year.
Ilhamsyah of the Confederation of Indonesian Workers Alliance, one of 290 non-governmental groups backing protests, said rallies were underway in dozens of places, including one attended by 3,000 in the industrial town of Karawang, West Java.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify this.
But local media reported about 200 workers demonstrated against the bill in Medan, North Sumatra, while hundreds rallied in the country's second-biggest city of Surabaya in East Java.
Activists had sought a permit for 30,000 people to gather outside Jakarta's parliament building, but Jakarta police had only allowed around 20 people due to the city's recently reinstated virus containment measures, Ilhamsyah said.
A Jakarta police spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

""We will hold more rallies to put up the maximum resistance,"" Ilhamsyah said by telephone.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar has quarantined tens of thousands of people to prevent a coronavirus outbreak from overwhelming its fragile healthcare system but public health experts and doctors say the strategy is on the brink of collapse as infections surge.
The Southeast Asian nation is housing more than 45,000 people, including COVID-19 patients as well as those yet to be tested, their close contacts and returning migrant workers, in buildings from schools and monasteries to government offices and tower blocks, mostly run by volunteers.
Even those with no symptoms or mild symptoms are hospitalised or quarantined, part of an ambitious plan to stop the virus swamping a chronically underfunded health system.
But the ""maximum containment” strategy pursued by Myanmar since its first cases were confirmed in March could backfire if overburdened facilities put people off quarantine altogether, public health expert Kyaw San Wai told Reuters.
""This strategy was implementable up to mid-August given Myanmar's low caseloads but as case numbers increased dramatically from late August, especially in Yangon, this approach quickly pushed both the health centres and quarantine centres to the brink,” he said.
Officials from the health ministry did not answer calls seeking comment.
After weeks without a local transmission, Myanmar reported an outbreak in the western Rakhine state in mid-August that has since spread across the country. 
On Thursday, authorities reported 535 new infections and three deaths, making a total of 7,827 cases and 133 deaths.
While some other Asian countries have pursued a strict containment strategy, elsewhere only more serious cases have been treated in hospital while others isolate at home.
""In other countries, they let people stay home and hospitalise them only if they are in a serious condition,” said Dr Kaung Myat Soe, chief of a temporary hospital in the commercial capital of Yangon.
""In this country ... we worry about young children or old people becoming casualties so we isolate them.""
The number of people quarantined has more than doubled from about 19,000 in August to more than 45,000 as of Sept. 21, according to Ministry of Health data. 
After decades of neglect under military rule, Myanmar's health system has been ranked among the world’s weakest. 
As of early this year, there were 330 intensive care beds for the 54 million population. The World Health Organization in 2018 put the number of doctors at 6.7 per 10,000 people.
Authorities are racing to build and requisition more facilities to accommodate the numbers. [L4N2GD1K8]
THREE NIGHTS IN HELL
Stories of facilities without electricity or water and positive patients forced to share rooms with untested people have been reported in the media. [L4N2GD1K8]
""The rush to mobilise new sites mean that these new quarantine centres are under-equipped to handle the massive deluge of people, which in turn is starting to undermine the maximum quarantine strategy as people become less inclined to undergo the quarantine process,” said Kyaw San Wai.
A Yangon resident who asked not to be identified said during her stay in hospital with mild COVID symptoms she was not allowed to go to the bathroom. Instead, she and a roommate were supplied with plastic bags. 
""My three nights and two days in hospital were hell,” said the woman, who then moved to a hotel.
Myanmar has a history of community mobilisation at times of crisis and government leader Aung San Suu Kyi has called on the public to get behind the effort to fight the virus.
People running quarantine centres in the Irrawaddy delta region told Reuters they depended on donations for items like food and protective equipment.

""Without the help of donors things would be terrible,” said Dr Ko Ko Lin, who volunteers at a centre.

""To those who have gathered outside of Central Precinct on Southwest 2nd Avenue. This gathering has been declared a riot,"" the police force said in a tweet. The crowd was told to vacate or face tear gas, other crowd control agents or arrest.
One of the protesters hurled a homemade firebomb or Molotov cocktail towards police officers outside of the precinct, a video shared https:// by Portland police on Twitter showed. 
Upper windows appeared to be damaged and part of an awning outside the building was on fire, according to a photograph shared by the police, which said the building had suffered ""substantial damage"".
Two police officers were shot and wounded late on Wednesday in Louisville, Kentucky, during protests over a grand jury ruling on the fatal police shooting of Taylor, a Black woman who was killed in her home during a raid in March.
Earlier in the day, the grand jury decided that none of the three white officers involved in the police raid on Taylor's apartment would be charged for causing her death. One officer was indicted on charges of endangering her neighbors.

""No, on the contrary... There are reasonable disagreements between scientists and the role of Chris Whitty as chief medical officer is to try to synthesise all of that scientific advice and present what he thinks is the best possible scientific analysis,"" Hancock told BBC Radio.

TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Japan's new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, spoke to South Korea's president for the first time on Thursday, calling for both countries to repair their frayed ties and cooperate to counter any threat from North Korea.
Relations between the two U.S. allies have deteriorated sharply over the past year over war-time history and trade, in particular the issue of Korean labourers forced to work at Japanese firms during Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule.
""I told President Moon that we cannot leave our current very difficult relations where they are now,"" Suga told reporters after a telephone call with South Korea's President Moon Jae-in.
""Cooperation between Japan and South Korea, as well as between Japan, the United States and South Korea, is crucial to deal with North Korea and other issues.""
Japan would ""continue to firmly seek appropriate action from South Korea"", he said. He did not elaborate.
South Korea had asked for the telephone call, Japan said.
Moon congratulated Suga and said that Japan and South Korea need to find the best solution on the war-time forced labour issue, said Kang Min-seok, a spokesman of the South Korea's presidential Blue House.
Moon said that South Korea and Japan are the closest friends who share basic values and strategic interests, as well as a partner that should cooperate for peace and prosperity of the world and Northeast Asia.
The two leaders also welcomed scheduled talks on the special entry procedure for essential travels between the two countries and expected it would serve as an opportunity to resume personal exchanges and improve bilateral relations.
The ties between Seoul and Tokyo soured after South Korea’s Supreme Court ordered a Japanese steelmaker to pay compensation for forced labour in 2018, which prompted Tokyo to impose export curbs on some key high-tech materials.
In a letter to Suga last week, Moon had said he was willing to sit down any time to improve ties. 
Suga replaced Shinzo Abe as prime minister last week.

Prize money will increase to 10 million crowns this year, daily Dagens Industri reported.
""The decision has been made due to the fact that our costs and capital are in a stable relation in a completely different way than previously,"" the head of the Nobel Foundation, Lars Heikensten, told the paper.
Dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel left around 31 million crowns - about 1.8 billion crowns in today's money according to the Foundation - to fund the prizes, which have been awarded since 1901.
The prize amount has varied over time, starting at 150,000 crowns and reaching 1 million crowns in 1981.
The value rose sharply in the 1980s and 1990s, jumping to 9 million crowns in 2000 and 10 million a year later. 
But the global credit crunch of 2008-9 hit the Foundation's investments and Heikensten, a former central bank chief, was brought in to get its finances in order.
The prize money was cut to 8 million crowns in 2012 only to rise again to 9 million in 2017.
Heikensten, who steps down at the end of this year to be replaced by former Norwegian foreign minister Vidar Helgesen, said the Foundation would continue to raise the amount of the prize money ""from time to time"".

In a statement, the Guatemalan military confirmed the crash of the Hawker 800 twin-engine jet in a mountainous area in the Central American country's Alta Verapaz region, but said the men had not yet been identified. Next to their bodies, 3 kilograms of cocaine were found in three packages along with unspecified guns.
The jet took off from the Cuernavaca airport, located about 45 miles (72 km) south of Mexico City, around midday on Tuesday without authorization or a flight plan, then landed at Zulia airport in northwestern Venezuela near the border with Colombia several hours later, the Guatemalan military said. 
Shortly afterward it took off for Guatemala, where it crashed shortly after 8 p.m. local time on Wednesday.
The theft of the jet, which can seat eight passengers, was reported by both local and federal authorities on Tuesday in Mexico.
According to Pablo Ojeda, a senior state government official, three men entered the Cuernavaca airport, two of whom claiming to be mechanics there to take the plane for a test flight. 
After filling up the aircraft's fuel tank, those two took off without permission, said Ojeda, adding that the jet's owners had not yet filed a formal robbery report.
Mexico's transport ministry and attorney general's office confirmed that the jet stolen in Cuernavaca matched the one reported crashed in Guatemala.
The transport ministry added it would launch an investigation.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) said on Thursday a move by police to narrow the definition of ""media representatives"" allowed at public events such as protests could limit scrutiny on law enforcers.
The guidelines, officially changed on Wednesday, now exclude recognition of press passes issued by local media associations such as HKJA and Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), while accepting journalists from 205 bodies registered with the government and international media.
News associations say the move could limit the work of and raise the risks of arrest for freelancers and student reporters, who have captured some of the most striking scenes of the pro-democracy protests that roiled the city last year, including a video of a police officer shooting a demonstrator in October.
Police are suspicious of student reporters, who fit the age group of the most ardent protesters, and say they have discovered fake media badges and been attacked by fake reporters.
""All the police want is to limit us,"" said HKJA chairman Chris Yeung, appearing next to representatives of HKPPA and six other media unions.
""Journalism students are the future of our industry,"" he said, speaking in front of a banner reading ""Defend the truth, no government vetting.""
Some students who said they were reporting for their student union publications have been arrested at protests for suspected crimes including rioting.
Late on Wednesday, Security Secretary John Lee said freedom of the media remained intact.
The change to internal guidelines meant that recognised reporters will be allowed in cordoned zones where media is not usually allowed and could also be offered interviews at the scene, which has also been rare, he said.
Lee said the guidelines do not attempt to change the definition of journalists who can conduct reporting outside cordoned areas.
The Foreign Correspondents Club (FCC) said on Wednesday the move was ""another step in the erosion of Hong Kong's once cherished press freedom as it would give the police — rather than reporters and editors — the power to determine who covers the police"".
The FCC expressed concerns that journalists not recognised under the new guidelines risked being arrested for unlawful assembly and rioting.
China's foreign ministry branch in Hong Kong said on Wednesday that the club should ""immediately stop meddling with Hong Kong affairs on the pretext of press freedom"".
""The truth is not to be distorted,"" it said. ""By anxiously whitewashing the fake journalists, FCC Hong Kong is attempting to endorse the rioters and condone their 'burn with us' violence, thus sowing more trouble in the city.""

Pro-democracy protests have been smaller and fewer this year due to coronavirus restrictions on gatherings and since the introduction of a national security law on June 30. There are calls for protests on Oct 1., China's national day.

The monarch, known as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, plans to hold an audience with Anwar soon to give him the opportunity to prove his assertion, after postponing a Tuesday meeting for health reasons. There’s no exact time set yet.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has maintained that he is still the legitimate leader and denounced Anwar’s attempt to destabilize the country’s politics.
Here are a few ways the king could decide to resolve the impasse:
Call an Election
The king has the power to dissolve parliament, after which an election must be held within 60 days. Lawmakers from the ruling and opposition coalitions have called for snap polls to resolve the political uncertainty once and for all, as Muhyiddin was sworn into office in March after the collapse of a government that took power after a 2018 election. Muhyiddin could also call an election, which he earlier said he might do if his coalition wins the Sabah statewide polls this Saturday.
Seek Confidence Vote
The monarch could request the speaker of the lower house to bring forward the next parliament sitting, currently set for Nov. 2, to hold a confidence vote sooner. The opposition has been planning to challenge Muhyiddin’s support in parliament for months, but the speaker has repeatedly placed the motion at the bottom of the agenda. In July, the prime minister proved he held a slim majority in parliament when he replaced the speaker.
Appoint Prime Minister
After former leader Mahathir Mohamad abruptly resigned in February, the king spent days speaking with each lawmaker to find out who they support, which led to Muhyiddin’s appointment. This time, there’s no leadership vacuum, so the monarch may need to urge the current premier to step down if Anwar has the backing of a majority of lawmakers in parliament.

Durani, 36, is a fierce campaigner for women's rights in the conservative stronghold where the Islamist Taliban militant group have major sway and take a conservative stance on the position of women, who mostly wear the burqa in public.
She runs a radio station for women, has served on the provincial council and was presented with the International Women of Courage Award by Michelle Obama for in 2012. Last year, Durani switched tack to open a female-only gym, which draws about 50 women attend each day.
""The reaction of the ladies was very positive because they needed it,"" she said, shortly after working out with a group of clients. ""What bothered me was the reaction of the men...who reacted negatively to our club and even insulted me because they thought our club was in opposition to Sharia.""
With a troop withdrawal signed between the United States and the Taliban, who have fought a bloody war for 19 years, many women in Afghanistan worry the militant group may exert its influence through formal political channels.
When the Taliban ruled the country between 1996 and 2001, they banned education for females and barred women from leaving the house without a male relative.
The group says it has changed but many women remain sceptical.
""My only concern is about their view of women's rights and what freedoms and restrictions they will impose on me,"" said Durani.
For now, her focus is on serving the dozens of women who attend the club, whom she describes as a cross-section of society including housewives and women who work outside the home.

""My only wish is to be seen as a human in this society,"" she said.

General Assembly on Wednesday all ""countries that defend peace"" should rally against U.S. sanctions clamped on the South American country and its allies like Cuba, Nicaragua and Syria. 
The Trump administration has ramped up sanctions against Venezuela in the past two years as part of an effort to oust Maduro, who it accuses of corruption, human rights violations, and rigging his 2018 re-election. 
Maduro has overseen a six-year economic collapse in the once-prosperous OPEC nation, which the opposition and most economists attribute to Venezuela's interventionist economic policies. Venezuela's ruling socialist party blames the U.S. sanctions for the country's woes. 
""We must demand the cessation of all unilateral coercive measures, of all the alleged sanctions, and that they allow our people to exercise their own rights,"" Maduro said in his remarks. 
Cuba and Nicaragua are two of Maduro's only remaining allies in Latin America, after left-leaning leaders lost power in countries like Brazil and Ecuador. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has rolled back a detente with Havana, Washington's old Cold War foe, that was pursued by his predecessor Barack Obama. His administration has also sanctioned Nicaraguan individuals and companies in response to what it calls corruption and repression under President Daniel Ortega.
In a later video address, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido - who is recognized as the legitimate president by dozens of countries including the United States - urged the international community to take ""decisive action"" to oust Maduro, without being specific. 

""Today I call upon all representatives of the member states...to consider a strategy that contemplates different scenarios after the diplomatic route has been exhausted,"" Guaido told representatives of over 30 countries that recognize him.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia warned the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday that an ""oil spot"" had been seen in a shipping transit area 31 miles (50 km) west of a decaying tanker that is threatening to spill 1.1 million barrels of crude oil off the coast of Yemen.
The Safer tanker has been stranded off Yemen's Red Sea oil terminal of Ras Issa for more than five years. The United Nations has warned that the Safer could spill four times as much oil as the 1989 Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez disaster off Alaska.
In a letter to the 15-member body, reviewed by Reuters, Saudi Arabia's U.N. Ambassador Abdallah Al-Mouallimi wrote that experts had observed that ""a pipeline attached to the vessel is suspected to have been separated from the stabilizers holding it to the bottom and is now floating on the surface of the sea.""
The United Nations has been waiting for formal authorization from Yemen's Houthi movement to send a mission to the Safer tanker to conduct a technical assessment and whatever initial repairs might be feasible.
The Security Council and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have both called on the Houthis to grant access. 
Al-Mouallimi wrote that the tanker ""has reached a critical state of degradation, and that the situation is a serious threat to all Red Sea countries, particularly Yemen and Saudi Arabia,"" adding ""this dangerous situation must not be left unaddressed.""
Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Iran-allied Houthi group ousted the government from the capital Sanaa in 2014. A Saudi-led military coalition in 2015 intervened in a bid to restore the government.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Firefighters notched a victory in their battle to beat back a massive blaze raging outside Los Angeles, more than doubling containment in the past 24 hours, the U.S. Forest Service said on Wednesday.
The Bobcat Fire, which has been burning in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles since Sept. 6, was 38% contained as of Wednesday morning, John Clearwater, USFS spokesperson for Angeles National Forest, said in an email update. 
The fire has so far burned more than 113,000 acres but remained relatively stable overnight. The flames were 17% contained on Tuesday. 
The Bobcat Fire, one of the largest and most dangerous fires in recorded Los Angeles history, is just one element stoking the worst fire season California has seen to date.
For more than a week it has threatened to overtake the Mount Wilson Observatory, a California landmark and beloved historical site that was home to major astronomical advancements in the early 20th century. 
Some 1,556 firefighters are currently deployed to combat it, the Forest Service said. 
Wildfires have ravaged the West Coast this summer and pushed firefighters to their limits. At least 26 people have died in fires across California since August 15, including three firefighters, according to the state agency CAL FIRE. 
One of those firefighters died as a result of a fire sparked by a botched gender reveal party.
Roughly 3.4 million acres have burned across California during the same period. 
Another 10 people have died and approximately 2 million acres have burned in fires in Washington and Oregon.

California has seen five of its largest fires on record in this wildfire season alone. Outside Los Angeles, the momentary reprieve could dissipate by the weekend, when weather was expected to grow warmer and drier, and forecasts showed the possibility of gusty winds, the Forest Service said.

President Alassane Ouattara's decision to run for a third term, following the sudden death of his handpicked successor in July, has led to recurrent violent protests. The opposition has called for further unrest in the run-up to the Oct. 31 poll.
The detainees close to Soro, who include five lawmakers, have been held without trial since they were arrested in December over an alleged coup plot that has led to Soro's exile in Paris.
Government spokesman Sidi Tiemoko Toure said some of the detainees would be released, although they may still face prosecution.
""This gesture can be appreciated as an additional gesture of appeasement by the head of state,"" Toure told Reuters. He did not say how many would be freed or when.
A Justice Ministry source said they could be released in the near future.
Soro has dubbed Ouattara's bid for a third term a ""civilian coup d'etat"" and urged the opposition to unite to stop him, while Ouattara's main challenger, Henri Konan Bedie, has called for civil disobedience.
They accuse Ouattara, who has been in power for a decade, of violating the constitution by seeking another term. The 78-year-old president says a constitutional change means his two-term limit has been reset.
Soro, who was prime minister from 2007-2012 and head of Parliament until last year, has been barred from the running.

Opposition parties have stopped short of saying they will boycott the poll, which the ruling party says will take place regardless of whether they participate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday warned U.S. politicians at the state and local level to be vigilant around Chinese diplomats who he said could be trying to woo them as part of Beijing's propaganda and espionage campaign.
Speaking in the Wisconsin state capitol, Pompeo said the State Department was reviewing the activities of the U.S.-China Friendship Association and the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification over suspicions they are trying to influence U.S. schools, business groups and local politicians.
The two groups are linked to China's United Front Work Department, an organ of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee, he said.
""Know that when you are approached by a Chinese diplomat, it is likely not in the spirit of cooperation or friendship,"" Pompeo said, warning of the Chinese Communist Party's ""influence and espionage campaigns"" even at the municipal level. 
""The federal government can’t police every bit of this predatory and coercive behavior. We need your help...Protecting American interests requires vigilance, vigilance that starts with you – and all state legislators, regardless of party,"" he said.
The latest swipe at Beijing comes in the run-up to the November election, in which U.S. President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China an important foreign policy platform. Wisconsin is a key battleground state in the polls.
Pompeo's speech triggered an outcry from Democratic lawmakers who accused him of using taxpayer money to solidify political support for Trump and, potentially, for himself as he is widely seen as harboring presidential ambitions for 2024.
CONSIDERING LANGUAGE ON XINJIANG
Pompeo also asked Wisconsin legislators to boost intellectual property protections and investment screening, and encouraged business people to ignore China's threats over engaging with Taiwan, the democratic island Beijing claims as sovereign Chinese territory.
Ties between China and the United States are at the lowest point in decades, with the world's top two economies at loggerheads over issues ranging from China's handling of the coronavirus to trade rivalries, new national security legislation in Hong Kong and tensions in the South China Sea.
He said Trump administration was carefully calibrating its language on how to describe what has been happening in China's western Xinjiang region, where the United Nations cites credible reports as saying 1 million Muslims held in camps have been put to work.
""When the United States speaks about crimes against humanity or genocide ... we've got to be very careful and very precise because it carries an enormous weight,"" Pompeo said.

The Libyan National Army (LNA) spokesman Ahmed al-Masmari said Abu Moaz al-Iraqi was among nine militants killed during the raid but was only identified afterwards. 
Islamic State in Libya was formed by al Qaeda militants who took advantage of the chaos after the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi to seize territory and launch attacks. 
The group took control of the central coastal city of Sirte in early 2015 and established a presence in the vast southern desert as well as active affiliates or cells in major cities. 
However, it was driven from Sirte in late 2016 and its influence since then has been limited to occasional attacks including one on National Oil Corporation's headquarters in 2018 and another at the Foreign Ministry in 2019, both in Tripoli. 
Masmari said Abu Moaz al-Iraqi, also known as Abu Abdullah al-Iraqi, had entered Libya in 2014 and became the group's leader in 2015 when his predecessor was killed. 
Islamic State's global threat has reduced in recent years after its self-proclaimed ""caliphate"" in Iraq and Syria was militarily defeated and much of its leadership killed. However, it remains capable of inspiring attacks around the world, security experts say. 
The LNA controls eastern and much of southern Libya and has for years been in conflict with the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - A Salvadoran woman whom activists say was falsely accused of homicide after suffering a stillbirth has been freed from prison in a case that has sparked renewed scrutiny of El Salvador's sweeping ban on abortion.
Cindy Erazo was initially sentenced to 30 years in prison after an obstetric emergency during her eighth month of pregnancy resulted in a stillbirth, according to Morena Herrera, head of the Citizen Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion.
Herrera said Erazo was accused of abortion, which is illegal in El Salvador, and then aggravated homicide. Her sentence was later reduced to 10 years, and then she was freed from prison on Tuesday after a review of her case. In total, she served six years behind bars.
Abortion law has been receiving renewed attention after the death in the United States of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a pioneering women's rights advocate, which has cast doubt over the future of legal abortion there.
In El Salvador, which has one of the world's strictest bans on abortion with no exceptions made for rape, incest or when the mother's life is at risk, some women have been sentenced to up to 40 years in prison.
Last year, a woman was exonerated on charges of having killed her stillborn son after serving three years of a three-decade sentence.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Sixteen months after elections, Belgium may finally have a new government as King Philippe on Wednesday tasked the caretaker finance minister and the leader of the Francophone Socialist Party with forming a ruling coalition.
Paul Magnette, in his second stint as leader of the Socialist Party, and Alexander De Croo, who formerly headed the Dutch-speaking liberals and is one of four deputy premiers, will report on their progress to the king on Sept. 28, the palace said in a statement.
One of the two men could end up as prime minister of Belgium, where the European Union and NATO are based.
The Flemish Christian-Democrats, the two liberal parties, the Francophone and Dutch-speaking socialist parties and the two Green parties have been in discussions in recent weeks on the possibility of governing the country together.
Belgium has been under a caretaker administration since the start of the COVID-19 crisis in March. A standoff between the various political parties since the election in May last year has dragged out the formation of a government.
Belgium's linguistic divide has always been a stumbling block in forming a government. After the 2010 election, the country took a world record 541 days to assemble a government.

All 2,500 undergraduate students at the Ecole Hoteliere de Lausanne must remain in their housing, including on-campus accommodation, until Sept. 28, authorities for the canton of Vaud said in a statement. 
That followed a number of major outbreaks among the student body which had made it impossible to trace which students had came into contact with the virus.
The festivities Swiss authorities believe to be the origin of the school's outbreak had been held before Vaud, which has recorded more infections than any other Swiss canton, introduced stricter measures on Sept. 17. 
Those included the closure of night clubs and a ban on private events of more than 100 people, as well as mandatory mask-wearing in public locations indoors.
Like many European countries, Switzerland has seen a resurgence of cases since lockdown measures were eased and some international travel resumed over the summer months.
Cases since the start of the epidemic recently surpassed 50,000. https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/switzerland
At roughly 33 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the last week, it remains less affected than a number of nearby countries currently at or nearer their peak.
It has taken a regional approach on many precautionary measures, leaving cantonal authorities free to impose them as deemed fit.
Ecole Hoteliere de Lausanne said it was working with regional medical authorities to support the affected students, who thus far had only reported minor symptoms, and would continue teaching remotely throughout the quarantine period.
""Important measures have been put in place on campus to ensure the highest health standards and to limit the spread of the virus as much as possible,"" it said in an emailed statement.

It said disciplinary measures had been taken against the students who had organised the privately held parties.

The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said on Wednesday it had confiscated 500,000 pounds ($638,500) worth of jewellery, including a gold ring emblazoned with the name ""Nisar"", from the safe deposit box of the former partner of Nisar Afzal.
The SFO said it used a listed asset order, a new tool in its 
armoury, to seize and forfeit listed assets linked to Afzal, which it believes to be the proceeds of crime.
His former partner had consented to the order, the SFO said.
""This case reinforces our determination to use every tool available to us to prevent those who would bribe, cheat and steal from resting easily on their illicit gains,"" said Liz Baler, head of the SFO's proceeds of crime and international assistance division.
The latest move on Afzal's assets comes after the SFO last year seized 1.52 million pounds from the sale of two properties in Birmingham, central England, bought by Afzal. 
A warrant remains out for his arrest after he fled Britain for Pakistan in the mid-2000s. The SFO alleges he was implicated in a fraud against mortgage lenders, for which his brother, Saghir Afzal, was convicted and jailed in 2011 for 13 years.

The world's top oil exporter and U.S. ally is an absolute monarchy without an elected parliament or political parties. Past attempts to organise politically in the Gulf state in 2007 and 2011 were suppressed and members arrested.
The National Assembly Party (NAAS) declaration called for an elected parliament and constitutional safeguards to ensure separation of the legislative, judicial and executive branches.
""The scope for politics has become blocked in all directions,"" it said, calling for peaceful change to combat state ""violence and repression.""
The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Saudi authorities have repeatedly denied allegations by human rights groups that they perpetrate abuses. 
King Salman, who had surgery in July, has delegated most responsibilities to his 34-year-old son and heir, who became crown prince in a 2017 palace coup and consolidated power. 
Prince Mohammed was initially hailed at home and abroad for bold reforms to open up the kingdom and diversify its economy, but his image in the West was tarnished by the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.
A Saudi court has jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years for the murder. Saudi officials denied Prince Mohammed played a role, but in September 2019 he indicated some personal accountability, saying ""it happened under my watch"".
The reforms he has introduced have been accompanied by the detention of clerics, activists and intellectuals, a secretive purge of royals and other prominent Saudis for alleged corruption, and the sidelining of rivals to the throne.
""The timing is very important ... the climate of repression is only increasing,"" party member and academic Madawi al-Rasheed told Reuters. She said NAAS would work with international organisations like the United Nations and human rights groups, without agitating for protests in the kingdom.
Saudi experts say while Prince Mohammed has fuelled resentment among some royals, he has the support of others and of the security apparatus and is popular among Saudi youth.
Party members include Yahya Assiri, head of UK-based Saudi rights group ALQST, Abdullah al-Awdah, son of jailed Islamist preacher Salman al-Awdah, prominent scholar Saeed bin Nasser al-Ghamdi and Shi'ite activist Ahmed al-Mshikhs. Abdullah al-Awdah told Reuters NAAS aimed to create a national movement by working with ""everybody from inside and outside the royal family"".

Around 15,000 men from all over Kenya and neighbouring Tanzania congregated in Maparasha Hills in Kajiado County, 128 km from Nairobi, to feast on an estimated 3,000 bulls and 30,000 goats and sheep.
The ceremony occurs once every decade at the site, which is surrounded by hills and dotted with acacia trees.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's sectarian politicians have overshot one deadline they had agreed with France and missing more may put at risk a French lifeline to haul the Middle East nation out of its worst crisis since a 1975-1990 civil war.
France has drawn up a timeline for Lebanon to tackle corruption and deliver reforms to help secure billions of dollars in foreign aid to save a country drowning in debt.
But the leaders who oversaw years of wasted state spending and corruption have stumbled at the first hurdle by failing to deliver on a promise to French President Emmanuel Macron to form a new cabinet by mid-September.
Yet choosing a cabinet may prove the easy bit. Once named, the ministers have a mountain of challenges, ranging from reviving a paralysed banking industry to fixing a power sector that cannot keep the lights on in a nation of about 6 million.
Macron, who visited Beirut after a devastating Beirut port blast in August, has told politicians they could face sanctions if graft gets in the way. And Paris has repeatedly said there will be no aid without change.
WHAT PREVENTED LEBANON NAMING A GOVERNMENT QUICKLY?
Factional, sectarian politics is to blame. At the heart of the cabinet logjam has been a demand by the two main Shi'ite Muslim parties, Iran-backed Hezbollah and its ally Amal, to pick several ministers and to keep the finance post in their hands.
The finance ministry will have a vital role in drawing up plans to exit the economic crisis.
Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib, a Sunni under Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system, had sought to shake up the leadership of ministries, some of which have been controlled by the same factions for years.
Hezbollah, whose political influence has grown, and Amal view moves to shift them out of key cabinet posts as a bid to weaken their sway, politicians say.
They have a parliament majority with their Christian and other allies, although the cabinet dispute has put them at odds. President Michel Aoun, a Maronite Christian allied to Hezbollah, has said no sect should claim any ministry.
But Washington's decision in September to impose U.S. sanctions on Hezbollah's allies deepened the Shiite bloc's resolve to dig in over cabinet appointments, political sources say. Washington deems Hezbollah a terrorist group.
Yet foreign pressure could also deliver results. Macron's intervention prompted Lebanon's bickering leaders to agree on the prime minister-designate hours before the French president arrived in Beirut on his second visit in less than a month.
WHAT'S AT STAKE?
France has said Lebanon faces collapse if it doesn't change course. The Lebanese president has said the country is going ""to hell"" if doesn't name a cabinet. Many Lebanese, thousands of whom took to the streets last year to demand change, have already been plunged into poverty as the economy has crashed.
Lebanon needs cash - and fast - after defaulting on its towering sovereign debt and with its banks on their knees. The Beirut port blast, which killed almost 200 people, handed the nation with a new repair bill estimated at up to $4.6 billion.
The central bank has been using up dwindling foreign reserves to subsidise vital imports of wheat, fuel and medicine. Lifting subsidies, which the central has said cannot go on indefinitely, will bring more misery and may stoke tensions.
Minor episodes of sectarian unrest and factional skirmishes have accompanied the economic freefall. Further deterioration threatens more flare-ups, while security forces are paid in a currency that is rapidly losing its value.
Donors who promised billions of dollars to help Lebanon in a 2018 Paris conference refused to hand over the cash when the country failed to deliver reforms. They have made changing course a condition for any future help.
Macron delivered a stark message in Beirut on Sept. 1: ""If your political class fails, then we will not come to Lebanon's aid.""
WILL THINGS GET EASIER WITH A GOVERNMENT IN PLACE?
There are big challenges ahead. France has drawn up a detailed roadmap for the new cabinet, ranging from swiftly restarting talks with the International Monetary Fund to launching tenders to start building new power stations.
Crucially, France has said the government must start to tackle endemic corruption quickly in order to secure funds at another donor conference that Paris has said it is ready to hold in the second half of October.

This means any new government faces a tight deadline. It may prove a tall order for Lebanon's fractious politicians who have already failed to name a cabinet on time.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>","How Trump fell out of love with his generals, and why the feeling is mutual","By Phil Stewart, Idrees Ali and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump picked retired generals for some of his most senior national security posts when he took office and boasts of heavy spending on the U.S. military that he asserts is unmatched in history.  
He has made getting U.S. allies to increase their own military spending a cornerstone of foreign policy along with a commitment to walk away from “ridiculous endless wars” in the Middle East that have killed thousands of U.S. troops. 
But the Republican president has also ridiculed his top generals, ignoring their advice on some key issues and questioning their intelligence, courage and commitment to their soldiers. 
Critics say Trump has used the military as a prop and purposefully undermined Pentagon efforts to remain apolitical.
A businessman and former reality TV star, Trump in 2016 won the presidency, his first public office, while challenging the establishment, including even fellow Republicans. He often, even publicly, rejects advice, most recently that of his health experts on the coronavirus, without losing much ground among his supporters. It remains to be seen whether this dismissive approach, including with his generals, leads to victory in his November election bid for a second four-year term.
This month Trump, who never served in the military, had to battle a report in The Atlantic that on a 2018 visit to France he referred to American soldiers killed during World War One as “losers” and “suckers.”
A review of Trump’s speeches and tweets throughout his presidency and interviews with aides and military officials show a contradictory and steadily deteriorating relationship, with Trump sometimes gushing with praise for his generals and other times portraying them as incompetent.  
Trump likes to say he pays more attention to the rank-and-file.
“I learn more sometimes from soldiers, what’s going on, than I do from generals. I do. I hate to say it. I tell the generals all the time,” Trump told a convention of conservatives in 2019. 
When he was accused of disparaging service members this month, Trump returned to the same theme and denied any wrongdoing.
""I'm not saying the military's in love with me. The soldiers are,"" he told reporters. ""The top people in the Pentagon probably aren’t because they want to do nothing but fight wars so all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy.""
Some current and former military officials say that Trump started out with extravagant praise for his generals but grew irritated when their advice ran against his wishes, frustrated by the wars he inherited and uncomfortable with an apolitical military leadership he sometimes sees as disloyal.
They complain he flouts norms of behavior in his open pursuit of political support among U.S. troops, who are meant to be loyal to the U.S. Constitution - not any party or political movement.
""Our civil-military norms can only take so much pressure for so much time,"" one military official said, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity. ""You're already seeing cracks. You're already seeing politicization of the uniform.""
A former defense official who served under Trump and spoke on condition of anonymity said the problem boils down to Trump's views on loyalty. ""He views it as: ‘Are they on my side or not? Are they with me or against me?’"" 
Despite painting himself as a defender of the country's warriors, Trump has seen his support among military personnel fall, according to opinion polls by Military Times. 
At the start of his presidency, 46% had a favorable view and 37% were unfavorable. The most recent survey in July and August showed those numbers flipping to 38% and 50%, respectively. 
White House spokesman Judd Deere (NYSE:DE) said Trump has demonstrated his commitment to the U.S. military and holds U.S. troops and their families in the highest regard.
""And he is awed by our soldiers’ bravery and courage to protect this country, our values, and our flag,"" Deere said.
       
CHURCH WALK    
Military chiefs briefly stumbled into America's political divide in June, when senior Pentagon officials accompanied Trump as he walked to a church near the White House to lift a Bible for a photo. This was shortly after law enforcement officers backed by National Guard troops used tear-inducing chemicals and rubber bullets to clear the area of peaceful protesters.
Adam DeMarco, a major in the National Guard, took the rare step of appearing at a congressional hearing to voice concern over the crackdown.
""The events I witnessed at Lafayette Square on the evening of June 1 were deeply disturbing to me and to fellow National Guardsmen,"" DeMarco said. 
Trump's threat to militarize the response to U.S. protests prompted some retired four-star generals to issue statements condemning it. The military is meant to protect Americans' right to peaceful protest, they said.  
Retired Marine general James Mattis, who was Trump’s defense secretary for the first two years of his presidency, was withering in his response. 
""Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people — does not even pretend to try,"" he wrote. ""Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort.""
U.S. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later acknowledged accompanying Trump that day had been a mistake, having created a ""perception of the military involved in domestic politics.""
MATTIS, FROM ADMIRATION TO INSULTS
Before taking office, Trump met with Mattis at Bedminster in December 2016 and brought him before the media, taking great delight in the general’s “Mad Dog"" nickname, and pronounced him right out of central casting. 
But he soured on the general and others for not bending to his will on a range of issues, at home and abroad. Mattis disagreed with Trump's berating of U.S. allies, his disparagement of NATO and his abrupt pullout in Syria, which went against the advice of his military.
Trump has since branded Mattis ""the world's most overrated general.""
The first signs of troubled relationships with the generals came early in his presidency.
In the summer of 2017, Trump was in the Situation Room talking about U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan with Mattis, then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster - an Army general - and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others.
The generals had a troop increase request and “thought they were going to stick it up under Trump’s nose and he was going to sign it,"" a former senior administration official told Reuters.
Trump raised all sorts of questions about the request. A meeting due to last 20 minutes went on for two hours.
""He just ripped them, the generals, everybody. ‘Why are we doing this, when can we get out, what does victory look like?’ It was really uncomfortable,"" the former official said.
After the meeting broke up, Trump asked them for ""real options.""
Although Trump initially reversed troop withdrawals in Afghanistan ordered by his White House predecessor, Barack Obama, he ends his term in office with plans to slash them to 4,000 this year and withdraw them completely next year, if a peace deal succeeds.
McMaster, who lasted just over a year as Trump’s national security adviser before being ousted, has sharply criticized Trump’s Afghanistan policy, accusing him of partnering with the Taliban against the U.S.-backed government in Kabul.  
Pentagon leaders see alliances as essential both to U.S. influence overseas and security at home. They voice alarm at Trump’s antagonistic approach to allies such as Germany and South Korea even as he boasts of his good relationships with the leaders of China, Russia and North Korea.
Risa Brooks, a professor at Marquette University, said military leaders felt Obama had micromanaged Pentagon issues and some were initially pleased to see Trump’s approach.
""But now I think we're in a whole other level. I think what is going on is that you see some of the stuff Trump is doing is a challenge to the core organizational interests and integrity of the military,"" she said.
One clear example was Trump's intervention in the case of Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, who was convicted of posing with the corpse of an Islamic State detainee.
Trump, who saw himself as a champion of troops being mistreated by top brass, reversed the Navy's demotion of Gallagher, and the Navy secretary was later fired. 

""I will always stick up for our great fighters,"" Trump told a Florida rally in November 2019.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Mali faces ""economic paralysis"" if sanctions imposed by West Africa's regional bloc after a military coup are not lifted in coming days, the head of the customs agency lobby said on Wednesday. 
Imports of goods into the landlocked, arid country have dropped 30% since the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) closed its borders with Mali and halted financial flows after the Aug. 18 takeover, said Ousmane Babalaye Daou, president of the Malian Council of Shippers.
Mali imports 5 million tonnes of goods every year, from woven cotton to cement, some of which arrive at ports across West Africa and are trucked hundred of miles inland. 
""If the embargo is not lifted now, in the coming days stocks will be exhausted, and we will see supply disruptions, production stoppages, layoffs, a paralysis of economic activity,"" he said in an interview.
Essential imports, including petrol, food and medicine are exempt from the sanctions, however. 
The tough commercial outlook raises the stakes for talks between the junta, which overthrew President Boubacar Ibrahim Keita after months of protests, and regional mediators who want a handover to civilian government before sanctions are lifted.
An ECOWAS delegation, led by Nigeria’s former president Goodluck Jonathan, was to land in the capital Bamako later on Wednesday.
Former Mali defence minister and retired colonel Bah Ndaw was named interim president on Monday while the leader of the junta that seized power last month, Colonel Assimi Goita, was appointed vice president. 
It was not clear if that arrangement satisfied ECOWAS, which did not respond to a request for comment.
Stockpiles have cushioned the blow so far, but new orders from Asia or Europe take up to two months to arrive, Daou said.

""Even if we lifted the embargo today and made orders ... we have to wait until November. This means that it is urgent that the embargo is lifted.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is unlikely to follow through on a threat to impose sanctions on Turkey after Ankara agreed to talks with Greece over maritime claims on Tuesday, senior EU diplomats and officials said.
But the progress left an internal EU dispute over Belarus unresolved - Cyprus, which - backed by Greece - is at odds with Turkey over maritime energy resources, is blocking EU sanctions on Minsk until the bloc takes a tougher stance towards Ankara.
The fate of proposed sanctions on some 40 senior Belarusian officials is up in the air, eroding EU credibility as it seeks to support a pro-democracy movement in Belarus after its Aug. 9 election that the West says was rigged.
EU sanctions require the support of all 27 member states.
""I'm afraid that, as things stand right now, we will have to insist on Belarus. It's the only weapon that we have,"" a Cypriot diplomat told Reuters, saying that the EU had not left Cyprus with a diplomatic way out of the impasse. 
Mediation led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Council President Charles Michel has calmed Greek and Turkish tempers after weeks of tension in the eastern Mediterranean, securing an agreement on Tuesday to restart talks on continental shelf boundaries that broke off in 2016.
""Dialogue has reduced the need to threaten sanctions on Turkey and so there's no consensus among the 27 for such a step right now,"" said one EU diplomat. 
Turkey's decision to pull a seismic exploration ship out of disputed waters was seen as helpful. A postponement of Thursday's EU summit in Brussels, due to focus on Turkey, has also served to allow more time, a second diplomat said. 
The summit, which was put off due to a coronavirus incident in Michel's security detail, will now take place on Oct. 1-2. 
Turkey began drilling for oil and gas near Cyprus last year despite warnings from Brussels, amid broader fears of a military escalation in the eastern Mediterranean as Greece and Turkey - who are NATO allies but estranged for years over myriad bilateral disputes - held naval drills in the area.
Cyprus proposed in June to impose sanctions on Turkish companies and individuals involved in drilling but many EU states say such measures would derail diplomacy.

""The Turks are playing a clever game. Being more engaging towards Greece, they are trying to drive a wedge between the other members and us,"" the Cypriot diplomat said. ""We seem to have been left by the wayside.""

According to the institute's archive James Bond came to Poland on Feb. 18, 1964 and was officially employed as an archivist for the British Embassy Military Attache. He soon came to the attention of Polish counter-intelligence officers.
""We know he was in Poland ... in 1964 and 1965,"" Marzena Kruk, director of the IPN's archive, told Reuters.
""He travelled a bit around Poland ... he liked women, the same as his literary namesake, but there is not even a word about Martini,"" she said, referring to the fictional character's favourite tipple. ""However, there is information that he liked Polish beer.""
Bond was under strict surveillance, and visited the Bialystok and Olsztyn regions of northeastern Poland to try and ""penetrate military facilities"" in the Soviet satellite state, according to the files. 
However, he was found not to have made contacts with Polish citizens, which would have had serious consequences for any Poles suspected of working with agents from the other side of the Iron Curtain.
The British agent 007 created by author Ian Fleming hit the silver screen in 1962 when actor Sean Connery played the character in the film ""Dr. No"", leading some to suspect British spies may have been playing a joke on their Polish counterparts with their choice of pseudonym.
""Maybe it was a bit of fun with Polish counter-intelligence, maybe he had a sense of humour,"" Kruk said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Western diplomats and legal experts urged China on Wednesday to clarify the status of 12 Hong Kong residents arrested by China at sea last month and whether they have seen lawyers of their choice. 
The 12 were arrested on Aug. 23 for illegal entry into mainland Chinese waters after setting off from Hong Kong in a boat bound for self-ruled Taiwan. 
All were suspected of committing crimes in Hong Kong related to the anti-government protests that erupted last year. Ten had been charged there, released on bail and forbidden from leaving the former British colony, and all are now being detained in the neighbouring mainland city of Shenzhen.
A senior Chinese official, speaking at an event organised by its mission to the U.N. in Geneva, said the 12 were entitled to access to lawyers and the presumption of innocence, but did not say whether they had seen lawyers of their choice.
""I believe that the law enforcement bodies and judicial bodies in the mainland of China will strictly follow the criminal procedure law and the relevant regulations and have a fair trial in the case,"" Xi Junjian, deputy director of the law department of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said in response to a Reuters question.
Western envoys and academics voiced concerns during a separate event organised by Britain's mission that focused on Beijing imposing a new national security law on Hong Kong. 
""Twelve Hong Kong democracy activists arrested in August off the coast have been denied access to lawyers of their choice. Local authorities have yet to provide information about their welfare or the charges against them,"" said Mark Cassayre, deputy U.S. ambassador.

Steve Tsang of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University in London, said: ""None of them have been accorded the normal legal rights that they would expect to enjoy as Hong Kong citizens.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Acting U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said at a congressional hearing on Wednesday that the department's internal watchdog is investigating a Georgia immigration detention center tied to allegations of improper hysterectomies and other gynecological procedures.
Wolf said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) inspector general would interview people at the facility on Wednesday and Thursday, but cautioned that ""some of the facts on the ground"" did not back up the allegations.
""At this point, they are allegations, and we need to make sure that they fully investigate them so that all sides have a chance to be heard,"" Wolf said during a confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
The claims were made by Dawn Wooten, a former nurse at the Irwin County Detention Center, in a complaint filed to the inspector general last week.

BERLIN/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny made his first public appearance on Wednesday after being discharged from a Berlin hospital where Germany said he was being treated for poisoning by a potentially deadly nerve agent.
Navalny was flown from Russia to Berlin last month after falling ill on a domestic flight in Siberia. The West has demanded an explanation from the Kremlin, which has denied any involvement in the incident and said it has yet to see evidence of a crime. 
A casually-dressed and tired-looking Navalny posted a picture of himself on a park bench on Instagram on Wednesday after the hospital treating him announced he had been discharged. 
The 44-year-old opposition politician said he planned to have physiotherapy and might follow treatment at a rehabilitation centre to regain his motor skills, including the full use of his left hand.
“After 32 days in the hospital, doctors decided that further recovery does not require in-patient care, but a normal life. Walking, spending time with my family. Immersing myself in a daily routine,” he wrote.
""My plans are so far simple: (go to) the physiotherapist every day. Possibly a rehabilitation centre. Stand on one leg. Regaining complete control over my fingers. Maintain my balance.”
He thanked doctors at Berlin's Charite hospital for the treatment he had received.
His allies have said he plans to return to Russia one day, but Navalny made no reference to such plans on Wednesday.
The German government says tests in Germany, France and Sweden have determined he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. 
Novichok is the same substance that Britain said was used against a Russian double agent and his daughter in an attack in England in 2018. The deadly group of nerve agents was developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s.
The Kremlin said that President Vladimir Putin's entourage did not have access to such substances. 
Charite hospital said Navalny's condition had improved sufficiently for him to be discharged from acute inpatient care.
""Based on the patient's progress and current condition, the treating physicians believe that complete recovery is possible. However, it remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning,"" it said.
Navalny received treatment at the hospital for 32 days, of which 24 days were spent in intensive care, it said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russian authorities were pleased Navalny was recovering and that he was welcome back in Russia, just like any other citizen.
Peskov reacted angrily, however, to an article on Tuesday in French newspaper Le Monde which cited unnamed sources as saying Putin had told Emmanuel Macron in a Sept. 14 phone call that Navalny may have poisoned himself. 
Le Monde, which said Macron had rejected Putin's hypotheses, reported that the Russian leader had told Macron that Navalny was a troublesome blogger who had tried to blackmail government officials with corruption allegations and that it was worth exploring whether Latvia had any involvement in the case. 
Peskov said there were many inaccuracies in the French report and said the newspaper was not in a position to know the details of what Putin and Macron had discussed. 
Navalny used social media to sarcastically mock Putin's purported assertion.

""What a great theory. I reckon it deserves the closest possible study. I cooked up some Novichok in the kitchen and quietly sipped it from a flask on the plane and then fell into a coma,"" he wrote.

MINSK (Reuters) - Ignoring calls for an end to his 26-year grip on power, President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus was sworn in for a sixth term on Wednesday after an election that the opposition and several foreign governments say was rigged.
The ceremony would normally have been publicised as a major state occasion but was instead held without warning following Lukashenko's claim of a landslide victory in the Aug. 9 election.
The opposition, which has staged more than six weeks of mass protests demanding his resignation, denounced the inauguration as illegitimate and called for more demonstrations on Wednesday evening.
The United States and European Union are drawing up sanctions against officials involved in the election and a subsequent crackdown by the security forces. 
The official news agency Belta said Lukashenko placed his right hand on a copy of the constitution and swore the oath of office at a ceremony attended by several hundred people.
The 66-year-old leader said the country needed safety and consensus ""on the brink of a global crisis"", an apparent reference to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""I cannot, I have no right to abandon the Belarusians,"" he said.
Protesters carrying red-and-white opposition flags began gathering in small groups in the capital, including outside at least three universities, local media footage showed. Calls circulated on social media for mass protests for the evening. 
Some chanted ""Sasha, come out, we'll congratulate you!"", referring to the diminutive form of Lukashenko's first name. 
Rumours had swept Minsk that the 66-year-old leader, in power since 1994, was preparing for a snap inauguration ceremony when a motorcade swept through the centre of the capital earlier on Wednesday.
An opposition politician, Pavel Latushko, said the swearing-in was like a secret ""thieves' meeting"".
""Where are the jubilant citizens? Where is the diplomatic corps?"" he posted on social media. ""It is obvious that Alexander Lukashenko is exclusively the president of the OMON (riot police) and a handful of lying officials.""
Latushko called for ""an indefinite action of civil disobedience"".
""SUCH A FARCE""
Germany reiterated that it did not recognise Lukashenko as president and called for EU sanctions to be agreed as soon as possible.
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said on Twitter: ""Such a farce. Forget elections...His illegitimacy is a fact with all the consequences that this entails"".
Lukashenko, taking the oath for a new five-year term, promised to ""faithfully serve the people of the Republic of Belarus, respect and protect the rights and freedoms of the person and of the citizen"" and defend the constitution.
He has so far withstood the protests with backing from his ally, President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Despite its population of only 9.5 million, Belarus matters to Russia as a buffer state against NATO and a conduit for Russian exports of oil and gas. 
At a summit last week, Putin granted Lukashenko a $1.5 billion loan, and the two countries are holding ""Slavic Brotherhood"" defence exercises in Belarus.
As part of those drills, Russian paratroopers parachuted into Belarus on Wednesday. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the swearing-in was ""absolutely the sovereign decision of the Belarusian leadership"". Asked if Putin was invited, he said it looked as though the presence of foreign leaders had not been envisaged.
The United Nations agreed last week to step up monitoring of reported human rights abuses in Belarus. Rights investigator Anais Marin said more than 10,000 people had been ""abusively arrested"" since the election, with more than 500 reports of torture and thousands ""savagely beaten"".

Belarus authorities have said the police are humane and professional, and have declined to comment on specific allegations of abuses.

Some of the miners have been underground since Monday, when the protest, which has expanded to 10 mines, started in two. Other miners have demonstrated for a few hours, a spokesman for one of the unions said.
The unions said that by Wednesday morning more than 200 miners were protesting underground. A PGG spokesman said company data showed 169 miners had stayed in the mines.
The protests in Poland's southern coal region were triggered by a lack of progress in talks between the unions, the government and PGG management on the restructuring of the state-run PGG, which is running out of money because of falling demand and rising costs.
The unions were also angered by the climate ministry's update of Poland's energy strategy by 2040, which contained a faster than expected departure from coal.
The government and the union representatives held 11 hours of talks on Tuesday and meet again later on Wednesday. 
Poland's ruling Law and Justice party has repeatedly said coal will remain Poland's main energy source and has been cautious in dealing with the powerful union leaders following violent protests in the past.
But European Union climate policies, which have added to the cost of burning fossil fuels rather than clean energy, combined with the impact of the coronavirus crisis, have pressured the government into more decisive steps to tackle loss-making coal mining.
""Protests won't help in anything today. They will not reverse the trends and will only make our work more difficult,"" Poland's Deputy Prime Minister Jacek Sasin told private radio Zet earlier this week. 

The miners plan massive protests on Friday in Ruda Slaska, southern Poland, where one of the coal mines set for accelerated closure is based and is a major employer in the town.

The Treasury in a statement said it imposed sanctions against ""the network of Kremlin-connected Russian operative"" Evgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and leader of the IRA.
The Russian IRA is a St Petersburg-based company that U.S. intelligence officials say was central to Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election.
Earlier this month, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said it found links to individuals associated with past activity by the IRA as part of its investigation into a Russian influence operation that posed as an independent news outlet to target left-wing voters in the United States and Britain.
""Prigozhin has an international network of supporters to spread his malign political and economic influence around the globe,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
""The United States will continue to target the ability of Prigozhin to conduct operations globally,"" he added. 
The Treasury accused the individuals and entities blacklisted on Wednesday of working on behalf of Prigozhin to ""advance Russia’s influence in the Central African Republic.""
Prigozhin, already hit with U.S. sanctions, has ties to mining, security and logistics companies in Central African Republic, the Treasury said, adding that his operations in the country are reportedly coordinated with Russia's foreign affairs and defense ministries.
Wednesday's move blacklisting a total of eight individuals and seven entities also targeted those the Treasury accused of assisting the activities of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the main heir to the Soviet-era KGB, and those helping blacklisted Russians evade U.S. sanctions.
The action freezes any U.S. assets of those hit with sanctions and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.

The Swedish military has also reported that a Danish military vessel entered Sweden's territorial waters without permission on Sept. 16. 
Tensions have risen in the Baltic Sea region in recent years, with increased Russian military activity forcing Sweden into a hasty programme of rearmament, including the purchase of Patriot missiles from the United States.
On Wednesday, Sweden, Finland and Norway signed an agreement to deepen military cooperation.

He said Iran has exploited a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers ""to intensify its expansionist activities, create its terrorist networks, and use terrorism,"" adding that this had produced nothing but ""chaos, extremism, and sectarianism.""
""A comprehensive solution and a firm international position are required,"" he told the 193-member General Assembly in a video statement, prerecorded due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The United States quit the Iran nuclear pact in 2018 with President Donald Trump dubbing it the ""worst deal ever."" Washington has since imposed unilateral sanctions and asserts that all countries also have to reinstate U.N. sanctions in an attempt to push the Islamic Republic to negotiate a new deal.
But all the remaining parties to the nuclear deal, including longtime U.S. allies, and 13 of the 15 U.N. Security Council members say the U.S. claim on U.N. sanctions is void and diplomats say few countries are likely to reimpose the measures.
""Our experience with the Iranian regime has taught us that partial solutions and appeasement did not stop its threats to international peace and security,"" King Salman said. 
On attempts to mediate peace between Israel and the Palestinians, the Saudi monarch said a 2002 Arab peace initiative is the basis for a ""comprehensive and just solution"" ensuring the Palestinians obtain an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital. 
""We support the efforts of the current U.S. administration to achieve peace in the Middle East by bringing the Palestinians and the Israelis to the negotiation table to reach a fair and comprehensive agreement,"" he said.
The king stopped short of endorsing recent U.S.-brokered agreements by the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to establish ties with Israel. Saudi Arabia has quietly acquiesced to the deals but has signaled it is not ready to take action itself.
Palestinian leaders have condemned the UAE and Bahrain's warming of relations with Israel, describing it as a betrayal of their efforts to win statehood in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
King Salman also said a deadly blast in Lebanon’s Beirut port last month “occurred as a result of the hegemony of Hezbollah ... over the decision-making process in Lebanon by force of arms.”
“This terrorist organization must be disarmed,” he said.

Authorities have blamed the Aug. 4 blast on a huge stockpile of ammonium nitrate stored for years at the port without safety measures.

46,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>",Divided Europe challenged to overhaul defunct migration policies,"By Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's executive launched a contentious plan on Wednesday for overhauling broken migration rules to resolve years of bitterness and provide a better welcome for refugees fleeing the Middle East and Africa.
The most sensitive element would de facto oblige each state to host some refugees - something eastern nations Poland and Hungary are dead against - under ""mandatory solidarity"". 
A country would receive 10,000 euros ($11,750) from the bloc's budget per adult taken in. 
""We need these people because we are an ageing society,"" said the top EU migration official Ylva Johansson. 
Endless feuds over where to locate people have caused bad blood between the Mediterranean-shore countries where they mainly arrive, the reluctant easterners, and the richer northern states where many of the newcomers aspire to live.
In 2015, more than a million people made it to EU shores, overwhelming security and welfare networks, and fomenting far-right sentiment. 
""Migration is complex, the old system to deal with it in Europe no longer works,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ""Moria is a stark reminder,"" she added, referring to a Greek migrant camp destroyed by fire this month.
The Commission plans would scratch a rule that the first country of arrival be responsible for asylum requests, which put too much burden on Mediterranean nations. 
Under the proposal, those arriving would be assigned to countries based on family links, history of education or work, or having a visa from a member state.
According to the Commission, the EU now receives up to 1.5 million net new foreigners coming legally to live and work per year, compared to only 140,000 asylum seekers arriving irregularly.
The plan was criticised by international Catholic charity Caritas, which said it could harm human rights, dilute legal safeguards and lead to more detentions. 
It also took flak from countries who would prefer to talk about tightening borders and asylum laws.
""We believe that the European Union and its member states must cooperate in keeping the looming migration pressure outside our borders,"" said Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs. ""Hungary does not support obligatory distribution.""
'MANDATORY SOLIDARITY'
But, highlighting the persistent divisions, the proposals won approval from Malta. ""Returning those with no right to asylum is crucial. Agree that solidarity must not be optional,"" said Prime Minister Robert Abela.
The 450-page proposals https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/migration-and-asylum-package_en spanning five different pan-EU laws put emphasis on sending back those who fail to win asylum. 
Intended to be in place from 2023, the plan also aims to open more legal routes for migrants, and work better with countries hosting people before they reach Europe.
It would also put EU countries with external borders under closer monitoring to stop illegal pushing back of people after reports of such action by Hungary, Croatia, Greece and Malta.
People saved at sea would be relocated in the bloc - rather than sent back - with charities not criminalised for rescues. 
At times of regular immigration, EU states would be obliged to help under the new idea of ""mandatory solidarity"" by relocating or sponsoring returns, or offering material assistance on the ground in arrival countries. 
If, however, a country were under major pressure, it could seek to activate a crisis mechanism under which EU peers would be obliged to take people in or send them back.
Returns commitments that fail to materialise in eight months - which national migration experts and some EU officials admit is tight - would transform into a relocation obligation, anathema to the easterners.
""Bottom line for us is that we might, and very probably will, end up with mandatory relocation,"" said a senior diplomat from one of the eastern EU countries. ""That is a no go for us."" 
That means the proposal faces an uphill battle despite having German Chancellor Angela Merkel's backing.
Merkel suffered electoral setbacks after opening Germany to Syrian refugees back in 2015. But in a sign of changing mood, German mayors now offered to take in Moria refugees and protesters even chanted: ""We have space!"".

A Gallup poll https://news.trust.org/item/20200923053835-sbak4, however, showed the world was becoming less tolerant of migrants, with EU states Hungary and Croatia near the top of the index https://news.gallup.com/poll/320678/world-grows-less-accepting-migrants.aspx of the least-accepting countries.

Meeting in the United Arab Emirates, a Sudanese delegation and U.S. officials held talks on how peace could stabilise the region and secure a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian question, the ruling sovereign council said.
The UAE, a leading regional partner of the United States, and Bahrain normalised ties with Israel this month in deals brokered by Washington, the first Arab states in a quarter of a century to break a longstanding taboo. 
In August, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raised the issue of Sudan establishing ties with Israel during a visit. Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok told him at the time he had no mandate to do so.
A Sudanese team led by General Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan, head of the council, flew to the UAE on Sunday to hold talks with U.S. officials on several issues including the removal of Sudan from a U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.
Sudanese officials held ""serious and frank talks"" on the future of Arab-Israeli peace, which would lead to ""stability in the region and preserve the right of the Palestinian people to establish their state according to the vision of a two-state solution"", a council statement said after the return of the delegation.
The two sides also discussed ""the role that Sudan is expected to play in achieving this peace,"" it said, without giving any details. 
The council, made up of the military and civilians, has been in charge of Sudan since the toppling of autocrat Omar al-Bashir last year.
Ties with Israel are a sensitive issue in Sudan, which was among the hardline Arab foes of Israel under Bashir.
In February, Burhan met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Uganda, a meeting condemned by Sudanese protesters. He afterwards cast doubt on any rapid normalisation of relations, though Israeli aircraft soon began overflying Sudan.
The talks also tackled lifting Sudan from the terrorism list, which hinders its ability to access foreign loans to tackle an economic crisis, the council said, without giving details.

Relations between Russia, which began its strategic command and staff exercises on Monday, and Ukraine - both ex-Soviet republics - soured in 2014 when Moscow annexed the Crimea peninsula from its neighbour.
Around 12,000 servicemen and dozens of armoured vehicles were taking part in the land-based drills, part of broader exercises including naval forces in the Black Sea.

Last week, Ukraine and the United States held joint military exercises a few days after Russia began military drills together with forces in neighbouring Belarus.

Paris has been pressing politicians for the quick formation of a government that will draw up reforms to tackle corruption and help attract international aid to fix an economy drowning in debt and struggling after a massive explosion at Beirut port.
Lebanese Deputy Parliament Speaker Elie Ferzli said he now saw ""promising possibilities"" for an end to the cabinet logjam.
The process of forming a cabinet hit the buffers this month after Lebanon's two main Shi'ite Muslim parties insisted they pick some cabinet posts, including the finance minister, which has been held by a Shi'ite for years.
Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib, a Sunni Muslim under Lebanon's sectarian system of power-sharing, had sought to shake up ministerial positions with a new cabinet of specialists.
Former prime minister Saad al-Hariri, a leading Sunni politician, offered a way out by proposing on Tuesday that an ""independent"" Shi'ite candidate be named as finance minister.
""This declaration represents an opening and all parties should understand its importance so that a government of mission can now be established,"" the French Foreign Ministry said.
France, the former colonial power, has been spearheading international efforts to end the crisis. Lebanese politicians have already failed to deliver on their commitment to French President Emmanuel Macron to pick a cabinet by mid-September.
""There are promising possibilities that can be built on, but we have to wait a bit,"" the deputy parliament speaker said, after Hariri's proposal and following talks with Nabih Berri, the powerful Shi'ite parliament speaker.
Berri has picked previous finance ministers. His Amal Movement and the heavily armed, Iran-backed Hezbollah group, the two dominant Shi'ite parties, have insisted the ministerial post remain under Shi'ite control.
President Michel Aoun, a Christian allied to Hezbollah, said on Monday Lebanon was going ""to hell"" if it could not form a government to ease a crisis that has paralysed the banks, sent Lebanon's pound into freefall and plunged many into poverty.

Lebanon's problems were compounded by the devastating Aug. 4 blast at Beirut port. Subsequent fires in and around the area and an explosion on Tuesday in south Lebanon have further rattled the nation.

The Islamist attacks in Cabo Delgado province date to 2017 but the violence has gathered pace this year, with insurgents seizing important towns for brief periods and hitting military and other key targets.
The Portuguese news agency Lusa said on Tuesday Mozambique had written to EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell to ask for help in training its armed forces to battle the insurgency.
In the letter, Mozambique - which is a former Portuguese colony - also requested medical equipment and humanitarian assistance to help victims of the conflict, according to Lusa.
A EU spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday the bloc had received a letter from Mozambique's foreign ministry and said, without providing further details, a reply would be ""prepared and sent in due time"". 
""The government of Mozambique and the EU have opened a policy dialogue, with a focus on humanitarian, development and security issues in Cabo Delgado,"" he said, adding the bloc was ready to discuss ""options for assistance"".
The EU will ""review all available means of support in the light of the outcome of the dialogue"", he said. 
The plea for help came as a report from the World Food Programme on Tuesday said that over 300,000 people had fled the violence in Cabo Delgado to neighbouring provinces.
It also came amid accusations of human rights abuses by Mozambican authorities in the northern conflict zone. 
Amnesty International reported earlier this month it had seen videos showing soldiers in government uniforms committing atrocities against alleged fighters in Cabo Delgado.
Mozambique's defence ministry dismissed the report, saying militants regularly impersonated soldiers.

56,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>",Special Report: A killing at sea implicates the armed forces in lawless Venezuela,"By Angus Berwick and Luc Cohen
CARACAS (Reuters) - Around midnight on February 23, Eulalio Bravo, a marine electrician, was dozing in his rack aboard the San Ramon, an oil tanker anchored off the coast of Venezuela. 
Suddenly, he heard footsteps pounding along the passageway outside. His captain, Jaime Herrera, cried for help. 
""Be still!"" an unfamiliar voice ordered.
A gun fired. 
By the time Bravo and eight other shipmates emerged to see what had happened, the captain lay dead, a gunshot in the back of his head. Herrera's stateroom had been pillaged, drawers flung open, his bunk overturned. The killers were gone, as were thousands of dollars the captain kept under lock and key, according to crew members interviewed by Reuters. 
The murder, one of a growing number of violent incidents that have roiled Venezuelan waters in recent years, is an extension of a bloody crime wave that has beset the country since its economy collapsed last decade. 
But it is also part of a troubling trend in which state agents, from military officers to police to senior government officials, have been accused of complicity in the very crimes they are meant to prevent.
After an investigation of the Herrera killing by forensic police at the nearby port of Puerto La Cruz, a state court in March ordered the arrest of three sailors from the Venezuelan Navy and four soldiers from the National Guard. 
Some of those arrested had spent time aboard the tanker in the weeks before the crime, according to six crew members who detailed the episode to Reuters. The accused, the court announced, face charges including murder, aggravated robbery and illegal possession of firearms for their alleged roles in the death of the captain, a 59-year-old Colombian.
Crime, both petty and organized, has been one of the most dire consequences of the social meltdown under President Nicolas Maduro. Gangs and paramilitary groups run much of Venezuela's black-market economy. Now, the public sector is in on rackets ranging from drug trafficking to bribes and kickbacks that grease the wheels of Venezuela's crucial oil industry. 
Maduro himself has been indicted in the United States for charges that include narcoterrorism. His wife, as Reuters reported in May, is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for her alleged role in drug trafficking, an accusation the government called ""slanderous."" 
Further down the government payroll, police and military officials have grown infamous for theft and violence. Last week, a United Nations report said the country's security forces have systematically committed extrajudicial killings, torture and other human rights abuses, likely under orders from senior government officials. 
""The state is complicit in everything,"" said Omar Gonzalez, an opposition lawmaker from Anzoategui, the eastern state where Puerto La Cruz is located.
Venezuela's Information Ministry, responsible for communications for the presidency and other parts of the government, didn't respond to requests for comment on this article. The oil, transport and defense ministries didn't reply to questions about the San Ramon, the Herrera murder or crime afflicting ports and maritime commerce. 
Police and the state prosecutor's office, responsible for the case against those charged, didn't return phone calls from Reuters to discuss it. 
The San Ramon's crew, who hailed mostly from Colombia, told Reuters they knew their voyage, a nine-month odyssey that began in Guyana in July 2019, could be problematic. 
Growing insecurity in Venezuela had already led some fellow mariners to avoid sailing there. And U.S. sanctions, designed to block commerce with Maduro's government, meant their employer, the Guyanese company that owns the vessel, could be punished for the very transaction they set sail for – loading a shipment of Venezuelan diesel. 
Yet their ordeal exceeded their worst expectations. 
Shortly after entering Venezuelan waters, the vessel's engine failed, the mariners told Reuters, prompting Herrera to radio for help. 
Instead of assistance, they said, intelligence agents arrived, boarded the vessel, and stole personal belongings. The agents then sought to shake down the captain, the mariners added, threatening to charge him and the crew with fuel smuggling – even though their cargo tanks were empty. 
When Herrera refused to pay, the crew told Reuters, the agents ordered the military to guard the vessel. For the next six months, until Herrera was murdered, the ship and its crew floated in legal limbo. 
""The experience destroyed me,"" said Bravo, the electrician. ""It was total chaos.""
Several aspects of the San Ramon's voyage appear unusual. 
Shipping data reviewed by Reuters indicate that its Automatic Identification System, a device that transmits a vessel's location and is mandatory under international maritime rules, was disengaged as it approached Venezuela. Loading schedules for Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state-owned oil company and the only legal supplier there, don't mention any cargo intended for the San Ramon. 
PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], as the company is known, didn't respond to requests for comment about transaction plans or its loading schedules, which were reviewed by Reuters independently. 
Crew members, in dozens of separate interviews, told Reuters that only Herrera knew the full voyage details and that the disparities could have been because of the engine failure and an abrupt detour they took as a result. 
Initially, they said, Herrera had planned to sail first to Colombia for maintenance and load the diesel on their return. It isn't clear whether the identification device was shut off deliberately or if the ship's glitches could have interfered with its operation. 
Either way, the vessel's problems were compounded by the failings of Venezuela's economy, its shipping industry and its maritime and defense agencies. 
Piracy off the coast surged after Venezuela entered recession – from a couple of incidents a year in 2013 to 30 by 2017, according to Control Risks, a London consultancy. While attacks have tailed off more recently as cargo traffic tanked, Venezuelan authorities appear unable or unwilling to manage them. 
Incident reports compiled by the International Maritime Bureau, an industry organization, show that the Puerto La Cruz port authority, after two separate tanker heists in 2018, failed to respond to captains' calls for help. 
The port authority didn't respond to requests for comment. After Herrera's murder, the agency issued a brief report about the attack on the San Ramon, but hasn't disclosed further details about it. 
In ports and dockyards, where decrepit vessels bob unattended and container lots sit empty, some workers have taken to stealing what little cargo comes through. In March, intelligence agents arrested the head of PDVSA's maritime unit, along with 37 other employees, for allegedly trafficking fuel.
Soldiers and sailors, charged with guarding many facilities, earn the equivalent of a few dollars a month, forcing many to moonlight and tempting some to turn to crime. 
Upon seeing their captain's body, the San Ramon's crew immediately had suspicions. The assailants, they believed, knew the vessel well – boarding, finding Herrera, and leaving without help. A boatswain, who peeked from his cabin during the attack, told Reuters he saw masked men wearing black military boots identical to those worn by the troops who guarded the ship.
When the court announced the arrests, crew members recognized the name of a naval legal officer among those of the soldiers and sailors charged. The young officer was charged with aggravated robbery and illegal possession of a firearm. He had grown friendly with Herrera, and had learned of the cash kept in the stateroom, crew members say the captain told them. 
""From the moment they boarded, the military started planning what to do with us,"" Bravo told Reuters. 
""THIS SHIP HAS BEEN SEIZED""
On January 31, 2019, a rusty, 75-meter tanker anchored off Manzanillo, Mexico, set a destination for Venezuela, shipping data show. 
The tanker was until then owned by a Mexican fuel company and known as the Lobos Tuxpan. The ship had spent recent years close to shore, mostly as a storage vessel. It was 40 years old and had already suffered hull damage and extensive repairs, according to shipping records and two people familiar with the company that owned it, Maritime Fuel Supply S de RL de CV. 
""They sold it almost as junk,"" one of the people said. This person said that Maritime Fuel Supply is no longer in business and was at the time liquidating its assets, fetching about $400,000 for the old ship. Reuters was unable to reach any former executive or owner from the company. 
The buyer: Seaboard Investments, a company that would appear in the commercial registry in Georgetown, Guyana's capital, several months later. Seaboard's director and secretary is a local trader named Sammie Ravendranauth, the registry shows.
Ravendranauth spent the previous decade ferrying malt beer and other goods from Venezuela to Guyana, according to records compiled by Import Genius, a company that tracks import and export data. Because Venezuela provides generous subsidies for food and other essentials, many goods could be bought there cheaply and sold at a steep markup abroad. 
The business had risks.
In 2011, a Venezuelan court document shows, Ravendranauth was piloting a trawler along the Orinoco River, bound for Guyana, when Venezuelan soldiers boarded to check cargo. Ravendranauth, the document says, showed them export papers for plastic chairs and beer. Below decks, however, the soldiers found 37,000 liters of diesel. 
In an interview in Georgetown, Ravendranauth told Reuters the fuel was legal, but that the soldiers suspected he was smuggling. He spent 45 days in jail but was released without charges, he said. 
The Venezuelan court document records that he was detained on suspicion of smuggling, but didn't specify any charges. Reuters found no evidence of any criminal conviction for Ravendranauth.
He was undeterred from doing business in Venezuela. 
In early 2019, he told Reuters, two associates in Venezuela approached him about a venture. The associates asked him if he would register a company in Guyana to operate a vessel that the Venezuelans would buy to export fuel there. 
Ravendranauth declined to identify the associates. Their names aren't in the commercial registry, and Reuters was unable to determine their identities. 
Ravendranauth agreed to the deal. He focused on administration, he said, and holds no financial stake in the company. ""I'm just like the front person here,"" he told Reuters.
When Seaboard acquired the Lobos Tuxpan, a broker had changed its name to San Ramón and moved its flag from Mexico to Togo. The broker hired a Peruvian captain to sail the ship from Mexico to the Guyanese capital of Georgetown. The vessel departed in April 2019 and arrived in Guyana that June, shipping data show.
There, Ravendranauth hired a new skipper – Herrera. He was a longtime captain and veteran of Colombia's navy, and knew South America's Caribbean coast well. He also knew many merchant mariners, like Bravo, the electrician and a fellow Colombian, who had recently sailed on another vessel with him. 
By July, Herrera had recruited Bravo, four other Colombians and a Cuban first mate. The job paid about $1,500 a month, crew members said, a good salary for the local market. And despite their misgivings about Venezuela, the mariners trusted Herrera.
""He knew how to lead,"" said Alexander Orobio, a machinist who signed on.
In Georgetown, the crew boarded a boat in disrepair, its red and blue hull scarred, its hydraulics leaking into a gearbox needed for propeller control. Ravendranauth, who visited the crew in port, said he agreed with Herrera that a trip to Colombia for maintenance was a good idea. 
On July 25, they cast off.
Herrera sailed west, following the coastline as they entered Venezuelan waters. The engine failed and for a few days they had no propulsion. When his mechanics restored some power, Herrera decided to call at Puerto La Cruz to seek repairs. 
On August 7, he anchored in Pozuelos Bay, eight miles from the port, and alerted the port authority of the ship's position. That evening, a Venezuelan Navy patrol boat pulled alongside. Reuters couldn't determine whether the patrol was responding to Herrera's call or whether it had approached the San Ramon on its own. 
A dozen masked military officers with rifles climbed aboard, the crew said. They identified themselves as members of Venezuela's military counterintelligence unit, known as the DGCIM, and ordered the crew to gather on deck while they searched the tanker. 
""This ship has been seized,"" crew members said an officer told them. 
The officer in charge summoned Herrera and two mariners: Enmanuel Penate, the Cuban first mate, and Orobio, the machinist. The officer accused them, without evidence, of smuggling fuel, Orobio and Penate told Reuters. 
Although they showed him the empty tanks, the officer persisted. He pulled Herrera aside, they said, and told him he could ""negotiate"" their release in exchange for a payment. Herrera refused. He later briefed the men about the alleged extortion, they said.
The Venezuelan agents left the tanker, but said the three men would face smuggling charges. They ordered three armed sailors to guard the ship and crew. 
When the mariners returned to their cabins, items including a costly GPS tracker were gone. Orobio said his phone was missing, along with the equivalent of about $25 in Colombian pesos, vanished from his wallet.
The crew became prisoners on their own vessel.
To pass the time, and while the accused awaited a court hearing, they worked to maintain and fix the ship. Three other mariners, local technicians, joined the crew to help with repairs. 
Ravendranauth said his Venezuelan partners paid other locals to convey food and other supplies to the ship. They also paid a lawyer to represent the men in court.
In late August, a Navy boat carried Herrera, Penate and Orobio to shore for the hearing. A judge told the men, cuffed in a chain by the wrists, that they faced 14 years in prison if they were convicted. ""We can't let you go,"" the judge told them, Orobio said.
The court, a criminal tribunal in the state capital of Barcelona, hasn't issued any public documentation on the case and didn't respond to requests by Reuters for more information. Ravendranauth and four Venezuelans familiar with the proceedings confirmed the hearing. 
Gianfranco Cultrera, the Puerto La Cruz attorney who represented the men, declined to comment, saying he wasn't authorized by the San Ramon's owners to speak about the case. 
""A GOOD MAN""
For months, the uncertainty continued. 
The Venezuelan Navy rotated guards on the ship and appointed Edgard Amundarain, a legal officer, to be its liaison, the crew said. He visited regularly, slept on board, and gradually endeared himself to Herrera and the crew, dining and playing dominoes with them. 
The captain often invited Amundarain into his stateroom, where they discussed the case and other matters, crewmen who saw them said. ""He won the captain's confidence,"" Penate, the first mate, told Reuters.
Amundarain had graduated from naval college the year before, according to posts on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. ""May God guide you along the path to success,"" his father, Edgar, commented on photos of the proud graduate in dress whites. 
Other posts by his father, himself a Navy veteran, related financial struggles for the family. Late last year he wrote that the Navy hadn't paid his pension and that the family would go without pan de jamon, a traditional bread filled with ham, for Christmas. 
""Total sadness,"" he lamented. 
Amundarain told Herrera about his family's woes, three crewmen said the captain told them. Herrera, they said, offered to lend Amundarain money from the ship's petty cash supply. The mariners said the cash, in a stateroom safe, amounted to somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000. 
Reuters couldn't reach Amundarain for comment or identify a lawyer for him. It isn't clear whether he and the other defendants charged in relation to the killing have entered a plea. Edgar, his father, in a Facebook message said he was ""worried"" about his son's arrest but didn't answer further questions. 
In December, a Navy boat once more took the mariners accused of fuel smuggling back to the courthouse. This time, Orobio said, the judge told them the charges would be dropped, citing a lack of evidence. Before they could weigh anchor, however, they would need an order from the Interior Ministry releasing the seized tanker. 
Herrera sought the order, the crew said, but never received it. The Interior Ministry didn't respond to requests from Reuters for comment.
The crew grew exasperated.
In January, Bravo and two other mariners asked Herrera for permission to leave on their own. The captain agreed and signed their releases, according to the men and discharge papers reviewed by Reuters. They hired a motorboat to take them to shore. 
Midway there a Navy patrol radioed and told them to return. It isn't clear why they weren't allowed to leave. 
On February 23, the mariners relaxed and enjoyed a Sunday barbecue. They closed off the gangway, as usual, at 7 p.m. Most of the crew returned to their cabins.
This description of the attack on their ship was assembled from individual interviews with five of the San Ramon's mariners. Their accounts were consistent with one another and with the limited details in the initial report by the port authority and the court's statement of the charges against the seven sailors and soldiers. 
Around midnight, Juan Carlos Cabeza, an engine mechanic, walked to the stern to make a phone call. While there, Cabeza told colleagues, six masked men boarded from a motorboat, aimed guns at him, then bound and gagged him. One of the assailants stood guard, he said, while the others went toward the cabins. 
Cabeza declined requests to speak with Reuters, but related his account of the attack to his shipmates. 
Midnight was when Herrera generally left his stateroom for a nightly check of the vessel. The crew told Reuters they heard the assailants encounter the captain and force him back toward his cabin. The boatswain, who spoke on condition that Reuters identify him only by his first name, Dagoberto, said he glimpsed the attackers through his door.
The group approached the cabin of first mate Penate. One attacker kicked his door. 
Dagoberto, Orobio and Bravo heard someone shout for the first mate to hand over his money. Then the assailant yelled: ""Open this door or we'll kill your friend,"" referring to Captain Herrera. 
Penate didn't answer. He spoke with Reuters by phone from Cuba about the voyage, but declined to discuss the attack itself, saying he didn't want to interfere with the case in Venezuela. 
Shortly afterward, five crew members heard Herrera.
""Help! Help!"" he cried. ""Call the Navy!"" 
Then the gunshot. 
Bravo, in a fit of panic, clambered through a cabin porthole, hoisted himself to an upper deck and hid in a generator room. He stayed until sunrise, shipmates thinking he'd jumped overboard. The rest of the crew, meanwhile, heard the assailants run back toward the gangway.
Santiago Suarez, a welder, said he opened his door and saw the captain, bloodied and face down, dead in the passageway. Penate, assuming command, radioed the Navy. 
Three hours later, a contingent of National Guard and forensic police officers arrived, the crew said. They shot photographs, dusted for fingerprints, and took note of the missing cash. They retrieved Herrera's body and ferried the crew to a Puerto La Cruz police station to give statements. 
Reuters was unable to learn the details of the investigation's findings.
Amundarain was indicted on robbery and firearms charges. Two other sailors, Josmil Perez and Victor Maleno, were charged with the murder. Perez, Maleno and their lawyers couldn't be reached for comment. People familiar with the case said the seven defendants remain detained, awaiting trial. 
On March 13, 254 days after they first boarded, the crew was allowed by prosecutors to leave the San Ramon. The tanker, Ravendranauth said, remains off the coast of Puerto La Cruz, awaiting further repairs.
Most of the crew drove home to Colombia. Prosecutors told them they may need to appear as witnesses in trial hearings, but that they could do so remotely. So far, no hearing has been held. 
Herrera's wife, Claudia, with whom he had two small children, told Reuters she's uncomfortable talking about his murder. She shared a video he sent last Christmas in which Herrera told her how much he loved the family. ""God willing, soon we can see one another,"" he said, sobbing. 
""I've been trying to remove from my mind thoughts of what my husband suffered,"" Claudia said in a text message. 
Bravo, the electrician, said he believes the killers took advantage of the captain's honesty and kindness. ""He was a good man,"" Bravo said from his hometown, Colombia's Pacific port of Buenaventura. He misses the sea, he added, and hopes to find work again soon. 

One thing is clear: ""I'll never return to Venezuela.""

By arriving at 05:30, she had secured a place at the front of the queue and a chance of avoiding what could otherwise be a day-long wait to get tested.
But she still had a long wait ahead of her: the COVID testing at the clinic in Chelles, an eastern suburb of Paris, does not start until 10:00 a.m. Wrapped up against the morning chill in a jacket, she passed the time by reading a book.
""I know people who'd already come here, who were here at 5:30 am and there were already lots of people, so I came early,"" Rabaron, from the nearby suburb of Neuilly-sur-Marne, said on Wednesday morning.
She said she wanted a test because she had been in contact with an infected person.
""I didn't want to wait too long, bearing in mind that elsewhere there are queues where people wait for five or six hours. So that's why I preferred to come early.""
In France, as in some other countries in Europe, the COVID-testing system has been under siege this month from patients worried they may be among the rising number of new infections. 
Across Paris, long queues snake around the block from clinics that offer testing. People who manage to get tested often report having to wait several days for the result.
By the time dawn arrived in Chelles, Rabaron has been joined in the queue by around half a dozen people. Nadia Benyhia, a Chelles resident, came with her sister. 
Their father is diabetic, and therefore vulnerable to COVID-19. They wanted to get tested to make sure they would not infect him with COVID.

""There are too many people, the queue is long, so that's why we came at 6:00 a.m.,"" she said.

The number of passes will be limited initially, and travellers must stick to their declared itinerary, the government said. Upon return, pass holders must self-isolate while awaiting results of a swab test, instead of undergoing the mandatory 14-day quarantine at home or at a hotel. 
The country has recorded over 57,000 coronavirus cases overall, mostly among workers living in dormitories. The vast majority of those infected have since recovered. 
Singapore, a regional travel hub, is home to the Asian headquarters of many global companies whose executives have long relied on the city-state's connectivity. It has reciprocal business travel arrangements with a handful of countries, including China, Japan and neighbouring Malaysia. 
""The idea is to be able to allow senior executives who are based in Singapore with extensive regional or international responsibilities to have a bit more flexibility to travel for their work reasons,"" Lawrence Wong, co-head of Singapore's virus taskforce, told a media briefing. 
However, those travellers must comply with the policies of the countries they are visiting, he added. 
Authorities also said that while working from home remained the default for Singapore, more employees will be allowed to return to workplaces with some precautions.
Among other easing measures, Singapore will from next month increase the limits on attendance numbers at weddings and in cinemas. 

Over the next few weeks, the government will look at how to further ease restrictions, including permitting travel with countries it deems safe and allowing more people to meet socially, Wong said.

NAJAF, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi doctor Tariq Al-Sheibani remembers little else beyond cowering on the ground as a dozen relatives of a patient, who had just died of COVID-19, beat him unconscious.
About two hours later the 47-year-old director of Al-Amal Hospital in the southern city of Najaf woke up in a different clinic with bruises all over his body.
""All the doctors are scared,"" said Sheibani, speaking at his home in Kufa a few weeks after the Aug. 28 attack. ""Every time a patient dies, we all hold our breath.""
He is one of many doctors struggling to do their job as COVID-19 cases rise sharply in Iraq.
They are working within a health service that has been left to decay through years of civil conflict and underfunding, and now face the added threat of physical attack by grieving and desperate families.
Reuters spoke to seven doctors, including the head of Iraq's Medical Association, who described a growing pattern of assaults on medical staff. Dozens have taken place since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
Meanwhile, the United Nations has warned that the pandemic could spiral out of control in Iraq.
Authorities have lifted many lockdown measures, allowing restaurants and places of worship to reopen, but they have shut borders to pilgrims ahead of a large Shi'ite Muslim pilgrimage that normally draws millions to the south of the country.
Iraq has recorded several thousand new coronavirus infections every day, and the total now exceeds 300,000.
More than 8,000 people have died, a number that some doctors fear will rise sharply, putting frontline healthcare workers under huge pressure and in some cases in physical danger.
The health ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the COVID situation in Iraq and medics' complaints about the threat of violence.
'I HATE MYSELF'
Sheibani, whose beating went viral when CCTV footage circulated online, said the family of the deceased patient blamed his staff for the death. He said he did not know how the video reached the public domain.
The patient had arrived at hospital in critical condition.
""I hate myself and I hate the day I became a doctor in Iraq,"" Sheibani told Reuters. ""They brought the patient in his final stages and he died, and they want the health system to bear the responsibility.""
Enforcing health safety guidelines within the hospital is not always easy, especially when tensions between families of sick patients and hospital staff are running high.
During a recent visit to Sheibani's hospital, which is a coronavirus isolation centre, Reuters reporters saw relatives of COVID-19 patients coming in and out of the ward without wearing full protective gear as they are supposed to.
Some were only wearing surgical face masks.
Iraq is fighting the pandemic with a depleted force of doctors and nurses.
In 2018, it had just 2.1 nurses and midwives per thousand people, compared with Jordan's 3.2 and Lebanon's 3.7, according to official estimates. It had 0.83 doctors per thousand people, while neighbouring Jordan, for example, had 2.3.
There are also significant shortages of drugs, oxygen, and vital medical equipment, the result of years of underspending.
Many young doctors say they are overworked, putting in 12-16 hour shifts every day meaning they are more likely to make mistakes in prescriptions and treatment. Some take kickbacks for handing over certain drugs, physicians told Reuters.
The Health Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
GOVERNMENT VOWS ACTION
Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi has condemned the attacks against medical staff and promised to hold perpetrators to account.
The attacks have increased in recent months, said Medical Association president Abdul Ameer Hussein. He said his association could not keep track of all of them, but they include verbal and physical abuse and even stabbings.
Sheibani filed a complaint with police, but he said he had received threats from the people who beat him up to drop the case.
""They might attack me or my family,"" Sheibani said, adding that he no longer left his house alone. 
Doctors say the government has not taken tough enough action to protect them from violence, which they have faced for years even before the pandemic.
The health ministry said in a statement on Saturday that it would assign its legal division to file lawsuits against those who attacked health workers, as well as those medics who fell short in treating patients.
According to the Medical Association, at least 320 doctors have been killed since 2003, when U.S.-led forces toppled President Saddam Hussein, ushering in years of sectarian violence and Islamist insurgencies.
Thousands more have been kidnapped or threatened.
Doctors and human rights activists say the state is so weak that it cannot bring doctor's assailants to justice, especially if they come from a powerful tribe or belong to a militia.
""The government can't protect doctors from tribes. Doctors end up dropping the cases because they receive threats,"" said Hussein, adding that he often asks tribal leaders to mediate when a doctor is being threatened.
Doctors have gone on strike and protested in recent months over what they say is government inaction over the attacks.
Abbas Alaulddin, 27, a doctor in Baghdad who was assaulted last week by the family of a patient who died of COVID-19, said he was considering seeking asylum.

""The situation here is unbearable.""

LONDON (Reuters) - A concert hall in the English city of Bristol that was named after 17th century slave trader Edward Colston has renamed itself the Bristol Beacon saying the long-debated change was aimed at making everyone feel welcome.
The concert hall was one of several places in Bristol named after Colston, who donated money he had made investing in the transatlantic slave trade to charitable causes in the city - a legacy that had caused disquiet and division for years.
The temperature of the debate was abruptly raised in June, when protesters inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement tore down a statue of Colston and threw it into Bristol harbour.
The government called the toppling a criminal act and critics accused the protesters of seeking to erase history. Supporters countered that the city had been debating Colston for years but getting nowhere, while the slave trader's name and image were an insult to many of the city's residents.
The process at the concert hall, which decided in 2017 to change its name and conducted in-depth consultations with a large number of people across the city, was less chaotic, although it was also acrimonious at times.
""It's been quite a rough ride. Not everyone agreed with the decision to change,"" said Louise Mitchell, chief executive of the trust which runs the venue, at a live-streamed launch event for the new name on Wednesday.
""We were accused of seeking to erase and censor history. We were told that we were wrong to use the morals of today to judge the actions of the past. It's an issue that continues to provoke strong views on every side.
""The truth is the organisation and the city can't continue to be held back by this historic association. The name has meant that the building is a place where some have felt unwelcome, or that they did not belong, be they artists or audiences, and very simply, if we can't be for everyone, something has to change.""
As Colston Hall, the venue hosted world-famous musicians like the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix, but a growing number of Bristolians refused to go there because of the name. The band Massive Attack, who hail from the city, had boycotted the venue.

Mitchell said the new name aimed to celebrate the ""unity and joy of live music"".

ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss parliament re-elected supreme court judge Yves Donzallaz on Wednesday after attempts by his right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) to oust him triggered a wave of protests.
The SVP group, the parliament's biggest, had asked the Federal Assembly not to re-elect Donzallaz, arguing he had betrayed his party's values, but he actually got move votes than in 2014 when he was last elected.
The vote marked a clear endorsement of judicial independence in Switzerland, where judges from cantonal to federal levels are members of political parties, need their support to be elected and make party donations in an unusual blurring of lines between courts and politics. 
The SVP criticised Donzallaz last year after he tipped the scales in a ruling to allow the transfer of UBS bank client data to French tax authorities. 
They had previously clashed when Donzallaz backed a ruling, which acknowledged an accord on the free movement of people with the European Union prevailed over Swiss law, a consensus among legal experts that the SVP rejects.
""The SVP cannot and will not take responsibility for Yves Donzallaz any longer,"" Thomas Aeschi, head of the SVP parliamentary group, told the debate. If other parties elected him, ""then he is your judge,"" he added.
Andrea Gmuer of the moderate Mitte party rebuffed the SVP. ""Federal judges are not stooges of their party. They are solely committed to the law and its interpretation"", she told the debate that comes amid efforts to reform judicial appointments.
Aeschi told Reuters SVP would have backed Donzallaz's re-election had he agreed to leave the party. 
Donzallaz denounced the SVP's attempts to pressure him.
""It's not just my personal case, there's an institutional aspect. I was officially asked to stick to party principles as much as possible in my rulings, that was simply unacceptable,"" Donzallaz told Reuters ahead of the vote.

63,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>","Explainer: Malaysia's political maneuvering, next episode","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A year of Malaysian political maneuvering has taken another turn with opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim saying he now has enough support in parliament to be able to form a government and replace Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin.
DOES THIS MEAN ANWAR BECOMES PRIME MINISTER?
No. It's far from certain Anwar will take the position he has tried to get for more than two decades.
Anwar's first step needs to be convincing the king he has the support of the majority of lawmakers. To do that he would need to see the king, who is currently hospitalised, though not for a serious problem.
The king could make him premier if he is convinced Anwar can command a majority, or he could dissolve parliament and trigger elections on the prime minister's advice. 
So far, no major political party has come out in support of him.
Major parties in Muhyiddin's coalition dismissed his claim as ""cheap publicity"" and said they firmly supported the premier. 
Anwar's own party only has 38 lawmakers - which means he would need to win over other parties or factions within them to get majority support from the 222-seat parliament. 
HOW DID IT GET TO THIS POINT?
Malaysian politics tumbled into turmoil in February when Anwar's perennial rival, nonagenarian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resigned in a growing power struggle within their alliance that won a surprise victory in a 2018 election.
Both ended up sidelined while Muhyiddin emerged as prime minister of a government in which the biggest party is the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) - which ruled Malaysia for decades until 2018 and to which Anwar, Mahathir and Muhyiddin all once belonged.
But Muhyiddin's position has remained precarious with a single digit majority in parliament, while UMNO withdrew some of its backing after former leader and former Prime Minister Najib Razak was found guilty of corruption in the multi-billion 1MDB scandal.
The opposition, including Anwar and Mahathir, had vowed to oust him, saying he won power by shifting alliances instead of earning it at the ballot box. 
HOW DO THE POLITICAL FORCES STACK UP?
Malaysian politics revolves around coalitions, but the strongest single party is likely to be UMNO - which stands for the interests of majority Malays in the multi-ethnic country.
Although it was voted out amid anger over the 1MDB scandal in 2018, it has improved its showing at more recent by-elections. Many Malays were unhappy with what they saw as too much focus on non-Malay interests, and particularly those of ethnic Chinese, under the Mahathir-Anwar coalition. Anwar remains allied to a largely Chinese party.
Kingmakers in any coalition, whether through elections or not, could well be the parties from Sabah and Sarawak on the island of Borneo - who have long asked for more autonomy and a bigger share of oil and gas revenues from state oil giant Petronas.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE ECONOMY?
Malaysia's economy plunged into its first contraction since the 2009 global financial crisis as a result of the impact of the coronavirus on trade and tourism.
While all governments are likely to promise large stimulus packages, political turmoil could hold up prospects for delivering on them and being able to find the financing for them.
If whoever forms a government is beholden to the Borneo parties, that could also mean that central government revenues take a heavier knock as they could end up getting smaller revenue from Petronas.

Muhyiddin, whose coalition relies on the ruling coalition from Sarawak for support, had already agreed to pay a sales tax they demanded and had shown willing to give them a bigger share of revenues.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Hundreds of Thai royalists marched to parliament on Wednesday to oppose calls from anti-government protesters for changes to the constitution as the assembly met to consider amending it.
The special session of parliament was convened after nearly two months of protests - the biggest of which drew tens of thousands of people at the weekend in the Southeast Asian country.
Protesters seek to change a constitution they say was engineered to ensure former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha stayed on as prime minister after last year's election.
They want his departure and some protesters also say the constitution gives too much power to King Maha Vajiralongkorn. 
The 2017 constitution was written by a military-appointed committee and passed a nationwide referendum in 2016 at which opposition campaigning was banned. Prayuth said the 2019 election was fair.
Warong Dechgitvigrom, who led the march to parliament by the royalist Thai Pakdee group, said he had submitted a petition with 130,000 signatures opposing constitutional change. 
""To amend the 2017 constitution, another nationwide referendum must be done,"" Warong told Reuters. ""Nothing good would come out of this amendment. It will only benefit politicians."" 
The group's move came after Thai legal watchdog group iLaw submitted a charter draft to parliament on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's consideration.
But the parliament secretary said that draft, backed by over 100,000 signatures, would not be considered this week because the signatures must be verified first.
Parliament will decide on Thursday how and what part of the constitution will be amended. Protesters plan to rally outside the parliament to apply pressure.
Parliament is made up of an elected lower House of Representatives, in which Prayuth's backers increased their majority after a ban on a major opposition party early this year.

Members of the Senate, parliament's upper house, were all selected by Prayuth's former junta.

66,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>","With echoes of Brexit, Swiss set to vote on immigration","By Michael Shields
ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss voters will decide on Sunday whether to tear up a pact with the European Union on the free movement of people, after a referendum campaign that exposed rifts in society over foreigners who make up a quarter of the population.
The right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) - the biggest in parliament - is leading the charge to seize back control of immigration, echoing some of the arguments pro-Brexit politicians used in the run-up to Britain's exit from the EU.
Opinion polls suggest it will not be so successful. A gfs.bern poll found 63% of respondents opposed the SVP proposal and 35% supported it, suggesting voters want stability at a time of economic uncertainty amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Nevertheless, the SVP has appealed to those who see their culture at risk from immigration, which by the middle of the century could swell the population to 10 million from 8.6 million now.
The party says jobs are at risk as young foreigners supplant older Swiss, housing gets scarcer and dearer, schools and transport become overcrowded and construction swallows up the landscape.
""Migrants change our culture. Public squares, trains and streets become more unsafe. In addition, practically half of all welfare recipients are foreigners,"" its campaign website says.
Opponents warn the plan would rob business of skilled workers - especially in healthcare, or for drugmakers like Roche and Novartis - and torpedo accords that enhance Swiss access to the crucial EU single market.
EXPAT KICKERS
The foreign influx is apparent at soccer club FC Uster near Zurich, where kids from immigrant families make up 60% of 13- and 14-year-old players, said club official Ali Özcan, whose own parents migrated from Turkey.
Of the 60%, a fifth are from EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries.
""Without immigrants Swiss soccer in general - professional or amateur, youth or women - would not be able to exist,"" he told Reuters, citing arrivals from the Balkans, Africa, and Middle East.
He said European expatriates tended to prioritise children's intellectual development and often planned to return home after Swiss stays.
Between the start of free movement in 2002 and 2019, the population rose by 1.3 million. Immigration contributed 1 million people, around 750,000 of whom were from the EU.
Citizens of the EU plus EFTA members Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein made up 68% of the 2.1 million resident foreigners in 2019. Italy, Germany and Portugal had the biggest communities. More than 450,000 Swiss live in the EU.
Wealthy Switzerland is used to absorbing foreigners drawn by high-paying jobs, including those that few Swiss want.
But the SVP has tried to put some limits on movement, including the ""Mass Immigration Initiative"" of 2014 that approved quotas on immigration from the EU, though to the party's chagrin it was watered down in parliament.
Voters decided to ban new minarets in 2009, reflecting suspicion among some Swiss of the Muslim community, and isolated cases of Muslim pupils' refusal to shake hands with female teachers have sparked outrage in the media.

Should the referendum drive fail, the government sees a window to tackle its biggest foreign policy headache: a stalled EU treaty that would mean Bern routinely adopts single market rules but which has run afoul of critics who say it infringes too much on Swiss sovereignty.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government on Wednesday defended its new, stricter coronavirus measures against criticism that they did not got far enough, saying it was trying to balance supporting the economy while protecting health.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson told citizens on Tuesday to work from home if possible and ordered restaurants and bars to close early, in an effort to slow a fast-spreading second wave of COVID-19, saying restrictions would likely last six months.
Britain has the highest COVID-19 death toll in Europe, with a total close to 42,000. New infections have been accelerating in recent weeks, leading scientists to say they could hit 50,000 per day by mid-October if left unchecked.
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab gave a round of interviews on Wednesday - six months to the day since the government first imposed a national lockdown on March 23 - seeking to persuade the public to abide by the new rules to avoid a second lockdown.
""What we don't want is to have to take even more severe measures as we go through Christmas,"" Raab said on LBC radio. ""And that's why we need to take the proportional, targeted measures we're taking now.""
Asked on BBC radio if the new measures were part of a Swedish-style plan to live with the virus rather than try to get rid of it, Raab rejected that suggestion.
But a decision by Scotland's semi-autonomous government to take more stringent measures, such as banning any socialising between households, cast doubt over whether the steps taken in more populous England would be sufficient.
""I've made a judgment that we are again at a tipping point with COVID and I'm looking at data that alarms me, frankly,"" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on  ITV  (LON:ITV).
She said her scientific advisers had told her the package announced by Johnson would be insufficient to bring down the rate of transmission.
In England, people can still socialise with members of other households in groups of up to six people.
Wales and Northern Ireland are also taking some different measures to England.
The Times newspaper reported that Chris Whitty, the national government's chief medical adviser, was privately saying further restrictions in England were inevitable to bring the epidemic under control.
A YouGov poll found that 78% of people supported the measures already announced, although 45% said Johnson should have gone further while 32% said he had got the restrictions about right.
On the business side, there was widespread angst over what the new restrictions would mean, especially for pubs, restaurants and other hospitality firms. The 10 p.m. closing time announced by Johnson was criticised as ineffective in terms of reducing transmission, but damaging to business.
Raab rejected this, saying the government's scientific advice was that the package of measures was appropriate to ""bear down"" on the virus.
Prof John Edmunds of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who is on the government's scientific advisory team, told BBC radio: ""Overall, I don’t think the measures have gone anywhere near far enough. In fact, I don’t even think the measures in Scotland have gone far enough.""
He said he believed very stringent measures woud come into force across the United Kingdom as some point ""but it will be too late again"".
Adding to the government's woes, there were signs of a fightback by the main opposition Labour Party, which had been in the doldrums after it was beaten by Johnson's Conservatives in an election in December last year.
The latest Ipsos Mori poll showed the Conservatives' popularity falling, while Labour leader Keir Starmer beat Johnson on a number of measures, with more people saying he had sound judgment and was a capable leader.

Opposition politicians and activists had been watching Wong's challenge closely as they press their campaign for greater democracy in the Chinese-ruled city through conventional politics and protests.
Wong, 23, was the only candidate in the district council elections to be disqualified, with authorities saying his candidacy contravened electoral laws that bar ""advocating or promoting self-determination"" for the former British colony.
Wong, who China calls a ""black hand"" of foreign forces, said at the time he supported the idea of a non-binding referendum for people to have a say over Hong Kong’s future status within China. But he is against independence, which is anathema for Beijing.
In rejecting his challenge to his disqualification, judge Anderson Chow said Wong should have filed an election petition instead of a judicial review, meaning he had chosen the wrong legal procedure.
Wong said he will decide his next steps after consulting lawyers.
Wong, who became an international figure after leading protests as a teenager in 2012 and 2014, was also among 12 opposition candidates recently disqualified from running in elections for seats in the city's legislature.
Those polls were postponed by a year, to September 2021, with the government citing the risk of the novel coronavirus.
Election officials said grounds for disqualification from the city legislature election included perceived subversive intentions, ""opposition in principle"" to a new national security law imposed by Beijing and intentions to form a majority that could block government legislation.

Critics said the Hong Kong government's decision to postpone the elections was an attempt to weaken the pro-democracy opposition in the semi-autonomous city. Hong Kong authorities said the only consideration was public health.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The majority of a 470-strong pod of pilot whales found stranded off Australia's remote southern coast has died, officials said on Wednesday, as rescuers struggled in freezing waters and fading light to free those still alive.
The group, which is the biggest beaching in the country's modern history, were first spotted a wide sandbank during an aerial reconnaissance of rugged Macquarie Harbour in Tasmania state on Monday.
After two days of a difficult and dangerous rescue attempt, state marine scientists said at least 380 of the long-finned pilot whales had died. 
By late Wednesday, around fifty of the mammals were freed but experts said there was a high likelihood they would return as many did during the rescue attempt a day earlier, creating an exhausting loop for rescuers who cannot work through the night.
The outlook for the remaining 30 stranded and still alive pilot whales, a species of oceanic dolphin that grow to 7 metres (23 ft) long and can weigh up to 3 tonnes, was bleak.
""As time goes on, they do become fatigued and their chance of survival reduces,"" Nic Deka, Parks and Wildlife Service incident controller said. ""We do expect to rescue more but increasingly our focus is what do with the carcasses.""
The refloating process involves as many as four or five people per whale wading waist-deep in freezing water, attaching slings to the animals so they can be guided out of the harbour by a boat. (Graphic: Whales stranded off the coast of Tasmania - https://graphics.reuters.com/AUSTRALIA-WHALES/azgvoakqwvd/AUSTRALIA-WHALES.jpg) 
The stranding, about 200 kms (120 miles) northwest of the state capital Hobart, is the biggest on record in modern Australia and one of the largest in the world, drawing attention to a natural phenomenon that remains a mystery to scientists. 
""It's certainly a major event and of great concern when we potentially lose that many whales out of a stranding event,"" said Peter Harrison, a professor at the Southern Cross University Whale Research Group.
""Quite often we only get to really see them when there are bad outcomes, such as this stranding event. We absolutely need some more investment in research to understand these whales in Australian waters.""
In 1996, 320 pilot whales washed up on the coast of Western Australia, in what was then reported to be the country's biggest mass stranding. About 600 pilot whales beached in nearby New Zealand in 2017.

""It's been more than three days, so we don't know if there are any survivors any more, but we are not losing hope,"" Satya Pradhan, the head of the National Disaster Response Force, told Reuters.
At least eight people are still missing and rescue personnel are clearing debris to look for them, said Pradhan.
The building, a three-storey structure in a narrow alley of the industrial town of Bhiwandi, on the north-east outskirts of Mumbai, collapsed early on Monday. 
Rescue work has been hampered by rain and a narrow entrance to the alley, which prevented heavy equipment from being brought in to clear debris.
Officials are still investigating the cause of the collapse of the structure that housed 54 apartments. 
Such disasters are commonplace in India during the monsoon season, as the torrential rains can destabilise old and often illegally constructed buildings. 
This week's collapse however, is one of the worst such incidents in recent years around Mumbai. 
Last month, more than a dozen people were killed when a building collapsed in the industrial town of Mahad, 165 km (100 miles) south of Mumbai.

MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's coronavirus hot spot of Victoria is considering easing curbs sooner than previously flagged, the state's premier said on Wednesday, as the two-week average of new infections in the city of Melbourne dropped below 30.
Melbourne, Australia's second most populous city, has been the epicentre of the country's second wave of COVID-19. The city has been under a hard lockdown, including a nightly curfew, since Aug. 2.
The state reported 15 new cases and five deaths on Wednesday. 
The 14-day average in Melbourne dropped below the 30-50 band which the state set as a precondition for allowing around 100,000 people to return to work in construction, manufacturing, warehouses and child care from Sept. 28.
""We are winning this battle and we will prevail. It's just a matter of us staying the course -- not letting our frustration get the better of us,"" state premier Daniel Andrews told reporters.
Andrews said if the average holds below 30 ahead of this Sunday's review of restrictions, it was possible further curbs could be eased, but he declined to say what those might be.
""We don't want to do something that might seem quite small but could present a significant challenge to us in a couple of weeks' time,"" he said.
The state is only due to lift a nightly curfew in Melbourne and restrictions on people leaving home for more than two hours a day and beyond a 5 km (3-mile) range after Oct. 25, by when the state wants the two-week average of new cases to drop to five.
Victoria accounts for 75% of the country's nearly 27,000 cases and 90% of its 859 deaths since the pandemic began.
Australia's biggest state, New South Wales, reported six new cases on Wednesday, while South Australia reported one -- all returned travellers in quarantine. 
""These are all really encouraging signs ... But we mustn't drop our game here,"" Australia's chief nursing officer Alison McMillan said, pointing to a surge in cases in Britain.

HERAT/KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan woman Laleh Osmany has been campaigning for years for a change to the age-old custom of officially identifying people by the names of their fathers, calling for mothers' names to be included on identity cards.
But her ""Where Is My Name?"" campaign, which finally brought a change in the law last week, has stirred heated debate in the conservative Muslim country where for some, speaking a woman's name in public is taboo.
The Taliban, who have just begun power-sharing talks with the Afghan government that could see them return to rule in some capacity, have condemned the reform in one of the first concrete stances they have revealed on women's rights as they engage in the peace process.
""From the beginning of this campaign until now, we've encountered insults, humiliation, threats,"" said Osmany, a 28-year old religious studies graduate.
For Osmany and many other Afghan women, a mother's name beside the father's on identity cards represents the rightful recognition of women in society.
""This right has been given to us by Islam ... we want to take back our rights.""
Osmany's campaign, which she launched on social media in 2017, paid off last week when President Ashraf Ghani signed an amendment that would recognise mothers equally with fathers on identification cards.
But along with the recognition from the president and the support of many woman, the reform has provoked anger.
""The inclusion of the mother's name on electronic IDs would be a disgrace and a dishonour for Afghans,"" Said Akbar Agha, who served as an official during Taliban rule, told a gathering to discuss reconciliation in the city of Herat last week.
'CHANGE IS DIFFICULT' 
Women's rights have improved significantly since the hardline Taliban were forced from power in 2001.
But concern is growing about the prospects for sustaining that progress with the possibility of a return of the Islamist group to a role in government.
The Taliban say they have changed and would allow education for girls and women to work outside the home, in some circumstances. 
But when pushed for details such as on whether women would be required to wear a face covering or work in jobs alongside men, they say the rights of women would be decided according to Islamic sharia, though without specifying how.
Many women harbour deep mistrust and doubt the sincerity of reassuring Taliban comments.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed that the group opposed putting the names of mothers on identify cards.
""From a religious point of view, the names of women are among the prohibitions that cannot be mentioned anywhere,"" Mujahid told Reuters.
""Mentioning the names of mothers, wives, sisters and daughters is not culturally tolerable in our society,"" he said.
Osmany said she was disappointed by the Taliban position but would not stop fighting for the recognition of women even though she was worried about her safety and that of her colleagues.
""We're not doing anything wrong, so we'll continue this struggle so that we can revive the identity of women,"" she said.

""We know change is difficult, it's difficult to change society but when we start working, we must not be afraid of obstacles and we should never give up.""

The opposition leader's claim comes less than seven months after Muhyiddin clinched the premiership following political turmoil that saw the collapse of the previous administration under Mahathir Mohamad.
The prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Should Muhyiddin get an audience with the king first, he could advise him to dissolve parliament and trigger snap national polls.
Muhyiddin came to power in March after securing a parliamentary majority with the support of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which was defeated in the 2018 election.
His opponents have accused him of grabbing power by shifting alliances instead of earning it at the ballot box.
But the premier has a razor-thin majority and there has been speculation he could seek an election to win a stronger mandate.
Anwar, 73, has had a tumultuous political career over the past two decades.
At first a rising star of Malaysian politics, he was jailed for sodomy and corruption after a feud with the government, spending nearly 10 years behind bars on charges that he and his supporters have described as a plot to destroy his political career.

But he was granted a royal pardon in 2018, as part of the deal with Mahathir for him to succeed the premiership.

State broadcaster SRF showed video of police leading protesters away from Federal Square. Removal was likely to last for several hours because some had chained themselves to objects including bicycles and metal fencing, requiring fire department employees to use cutting tools. 

The protesters, from various environmental campaign organisations, erected the camp in the heart of Bern's political centre on Monday to highlight demands for Switzerland to do more to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2030.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A vehicle that may be carrying a ballistic missile has been spotted at a parade training ground in North Korea amid signs it is preparing a big military display for an Oct. 10 holiday, a U.S. think-tank said.
Commercial satellite imagery taken on Tuesday showed a ""probable missile-related vehicle"" at the Mirim Parade Training Ground outside the capital, Pyongyang, according to a report by the group 38 North, which monitors North Korea.
""While imagery resolution is insufficient to determine exactly what the vehicle is, relative size and shape suggests that it may be a transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) for a large missile,"" the group said.
The vehicle appeared to be large enough to carry one of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), which are believed to be capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to targets as far as anywhere in the United States.
The authors acknowledged there was a chance the vehicle could be something else but said that seemed ""unlikely in this particular location and circumstance"".
Satellite imagery had also shown large formations of troops and vehicles practicing at the parade training ground, 38 North reported.
""The recent training strongly suggests a large military parade is planned for the 75th anniversary of the Workers’ Party of Korea on October 10,"" the think-tank said.
North Korea has not shown its largest ballistic missiles at military parades since early 2018, when leader Kim Jong Un began a flurry of diplomatic engagement that included three meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump.
But talks aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear programme have since stalled and earlier this year Kim vowed to unveil a new, unspecified ""strategic weapon"".
Analysts have said the North Korea could use the holiday to showcase new weapons, either at a parade or in a test.
U.S. officials said this week that nuclear-armed North Korea had resumed long-range missile cooperation with Iran but did not provide detailed evidence.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's President Joko Widodo used his first address to the United Nations General Assembly to warn on Wednesday that global stability and peace could be ""destroyed"" if growing geo-political rivalries persist.
""War will benefit no one. There is no point of celebrating victory among ruins. There is no point of becoming the largest economic power in the midst of a sinking world,"" said the president, widely known as Jokowi.
His comments came as tensions between the United States and China escalate, including in the South China Sea.
China claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, a position rejected by Washington and some Southeast Asian states, including Indonesia, citing provisions in the U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea.
Earlier this month, Indonesia's government protested when a Chinese coast guard vessel entered the portion of the South China Sea it claims. It was the latest of several Chinese incursions in the past year.
""The principles of the U.N. Charter and international law are often neglected, including the respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Jokowi told the U.N.
The dangers of U.S.-China tensions was picked up by Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte. The Philippines has competing claims with China in the South China Sea.
""Given the size and military might of the contenders, we can only imagine and be aghast at the terrible toll on human life and property that shall be inflicted if the 'word war' deteriorates into a real war of nuclear weapons and missiles,"" he told the U.N. general assembly.
Jokowi said the coronavirus pandemic was a time for global unity.
""What we see, instead, is one of deep division and growing rivalries,"" he said. ""If division and rivalries continue to persist, then I am concerned that the pillars of stability and sustainable peace will crumble or even (be) destroyed.""

He said that Indonesia would be a ""bridge builder"" and advocate for global equality.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Former rebel military commander Ishmael Toroama has been elected as president of Bougainville, an autonomous region in the South Pacific, electoral officials said on Wednesday, and is set to lead talks seeking independence from Papua New Guinea.
The general election was the first since Bougainville voted overwhelmingly for a separation from Papua New Guinea at the end of last year, with Toroama defeating an open field, the Bougainville Electoral Commissioner said.
Bougainville, a mineral-rich and lush group of islands in the South Pacific, has been hampered by years of little economic progress following a decade-long civil war that claimed as many as 20,000 lives before ending in 1998.
The conflict was largely fought over how the profits from the lucrative Panguna gold and copper mine on Bougainville Island should be shared and the environmental damage it had caused. 
Toroama was a commander in the secessionist Bougainville Revolutionary Army, and later worked on the peace and disarmament process.
His victory marks a break from the current administration, led by President John Momis, after the government's candidate was earlier eliminated in the region's preferential voting system.
Last year's non-binding independence poll was part of the peace process that ended the conflict although there remains competing claims over development rights to the long-shuttered Panguna mine.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities are preparing arrest warrants that could for the first time target soldiers in the investigation into the 2014 abduction and presumed massacre of 43 students, according to three sources briefed on the new developments.
The unsolved kidnapping of the young men who were training to be teachers convulsed the country and garnered international condemnation as one of the darkest examples of the government's longstanding difficulty preventing violence or convicting those responsible.
In the years since the disappearance of the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College students in southern Guerrero state, calls to look into the potential role of army soldiers have intensified, including those stationed at a nearby base at the time of the alleged abduction.
""Arrest warrants are included for local, state and federal police in Guerrero, as well as for members (of the military) of the 27th battalion,"" said one source on condition of anonymity who was not authorized to speak to the media.
Two other sources, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the inclusion of soldiers among the new warrants.
Neither the attorney general's office nor representatives of a national truth commission responded to requests for comment.
The defense ministry said it had no information to provide about new arrest warrants.
On Tuesday, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he will provide new information on the case on the sixth anniversary of the kidnapping at the weekend, including ""arrest warrants in progress.""
""What's matters most is to find out where the young men are,"" he said.
He did not specify the targets of the arrest warrants, but noted that he will also address the charges against Tomas Zeron, a top security official in the previous administration who is wanted for tampering with evidence and torture in the case.
Last week, Lopez Obrador called on Israel, where the ex-head of criminal investigations is believed to be located, to offer him no protection from facing justice back home.
The Sept. 26, 2014 kidnapping remains one of the most infamous incidents during the 13 years of Mexico's drug war. 
Lopez Obrador told family members shortly after he took office nearly two years ago that there would be no impunity for anyone involved in the crime.
Investigators in July found a bone fragment belonging to one of the student teachers, which authorities said could open new leads.
Before that, authorities had definitively identified the remains of just one student teacher.
Another source said the arrest warrants have met standards of proof and were signed off on by a judge. The source gave no more details. 
The sources did not know how many warrants would be issued or the timing.
The disappearance of the 43 students has exposed deep flaws in Mexico's criminal justice system, and led to involvement of the Washington-based Inter-American Human Rights Commission. 
In 2015, the commission established the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts, or IGIE, to assist the government's investigation.
The IGIE's work documented serious flaws in a previous government investigation that concluded the students were incinerated in a dump after they were turned over to gang members by corrupt local police.
It is still not clear exactly what happened. One theory by the group of experts was that the students were killed after they mistakenly commandeered a bus carrying a cargo of heroin.
The panel's five experts have insisted on interviewing soldiers stationed in the town at the time, but to date both the Lopez Obrador administration as well as the government led by his predecessor, former President Enrique Peña Nieto, have not made them available to interviewers.
The experts have carried out similar fact-finding interviews with local, state and federal police as well as gang members suspected of involvement in the abduction or murder.

(Reuters) - The University of California system unfairly admitted 64 ""noncompetitive"" students between 2013 and 2019, the California state auditor said in a report released on Tuesday that echoed a 2019 college admissions scandal involving at least eight schools across the country.
The California system admissions process ""has not treated applicants fairly or consistently,"" auditor Elaine Howle wrote in a letter to Governor Gavin Newsom and the state legislature.
The network of colleges enrolls more than 280,000 students across 10 campuses. The University of California, Berkeley has historically been considered the system's most prestigious, and ranks among the best public universities in the United States. 
The audit determined that 22 students had been admitted as student athletes without full qualifications, while another 42 students had been admitted at Berkeley largely because of family connections or donations.
In a statement emailed to Reuters, University of California President Michael V. Drake said he took the auditor's findings ""very seriously"" and the university would ""swiftly address"" concerns raised by the report and discipline individuals involved. The system plans to review and act on the findings in the coming weeks, he said.
The audit came in the wake of 2019's college admissions bribery scandal uncovered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. More than 50 people were charged in connection with attempts to gain access to elite colleges using bribery, donations, and padded and fabricated credentials. Several students identified in that scandal had doctored athletic qualifications. 
The actress Lori Laughlin was sentenced in August to two months in prison and issued $150,000 in fines for her participation in the scheme by helping her two daughters fake qualifications to get into the University of Southern California.

In the California case, the state auditor found that reviewers for the University of California were inconsistent in their judgment of applicants and that oversight of the admissions process needed to be improved.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Crews fought on Tuesday to defend homes and the famed Mount Wilson Observatory from California's biggest and most dangerous wildfire, standing their ground at a major highway between the flames and populated areas. 
The Bobcat Fire, which broke out Sept. 6 in the Angeles National Forest north of Los Angeles, has already blackened an area larger than the city of Atlanta and its rapid spread prompted worried law enforcement officials to call for new evacuations on Monday evening. 
Once home to the largest operational telescope in the world, the Mount Wilson Observatory, which sits on a peak of the San Gabriel mountains near vital communications towers, said in an update that almost all the forest around it had burned.
Firefighters overnight kept the Bobcat from breaching containment lines near the observatory and were preventively burning vegetation ahead of the fire along state Highway 2, which runs northeast from Los Angeles. 
This summer California already has seen more land charred by wildfires than in any previous full year, with some 3.4 million acres burned since mid-August. 
The fires, stoked by extreme weather conditions that some scientists call evidence of climate change, have destroyed some 6,100 homes and other structures and killed 26 people, three of them firefighters.
Another 2 million acres have burned in Oregon and Washington during an outbreak of wildfires, destroying more than 4,400 structures and claiming 10 lives. But rain showers across the western Cascade mountain range helped fire crews in the Pacific Northwest gain control of those conflagrations. 
Although California has seen little rain in September, bouts of high temperatures and gale-force winds have given way in recent days to cooler weather, enabling firefighters to gain ground.
But forecasters predict rising temperatures, lower humidity and a return of strong, erratic winds around midweek in Southern California and by the weekend across the state's northern half, lending urgency to the firefight.
The Bobcat Fire has now scorched more than 109,000 acres to become one of the largest wildfires in recorded Los Angeles County history and was only 17% contained on Tuesday afternoon.
The flames came perilously close to the Mount Wilson Observatory last week before they were driven back by crews using air support. 
Several more areas, including Pasadena, a city of 140,000 people, remained under evacuation warnings. 

California's fire season historically has run through October. Five of the state's 20 largest blazes on record have occurred this year.

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) said Tuesday it had removed a network of inauthentic Chinese accounts that were interfering in Asian and American politics, including some that posted material supporting and opposing U.S. President Donald Trump. 
The social networking company said it suspended 155 accounts on its main platform along with six Instagram accounts. The most widely followed accounts and pages were in the Philippines, where they shared content supporting China’s actions in the contested South China Sea and President Rodrigo Duterte.
The U.S. accounts had fewer followers and posted content fueling both sides of the American election that will be held on Nov. 3, the company said. 
Facebook cybersecurity policy chief Nathaniel Gleicher said that the takedown was the company's first of Chinese-based accounts on foreign-interference grounds with any engagement in U.S. politics. But he said the American accounts and groups seemed aimed mainly at building an audience.
""The volume of content is so low, it's very hard to assess what their goal is,"" Gleicher said. 
Trump and his intelligence officials have said China was favoring Democratic challenger Joe Biden, while Democrats in Congress have said Russia is being more aggressive.
The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to an email seeking comment.
The network of accounts, pages and groups used virtual private networks and other tools to make it appear they were operated from somewhere other than China, Facebook said.
Fewer than 3,000 people followed the fake American pages, while more than 100,000 accounts tracked those in Philippines.
The operation's U.S. assets, added between May and August, included a group called Biden Harris 2020 that had around 1,400 members and one called Trump KAG 2020 that said it supported Trump’s re-election and had just three members, according to analysis firm Graphika, which studied material from Facebook.

In Philippines, accounts supported both Duterte and his daughter, who might run to succeed him in 2022. They also criticized Rappler, an independent media group that is a frequent target of the Duterte government.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday that China must be held accountable for having ""unleashed"" COVID-19 on the world, prompting Beijing to accuse him of ""lies"" and abusing the U.N. platform to provoke confrontation.
China's President Xi Jinping struck a conciliatory tone in his pre-recorded virtual address to the General Assembly, calling for enhanced cooperation over the pandemic and stressing that China had no intention of fighting ""either a Cold War or a hot war with any country."" 
But China's U.N. ambassador Zhang Jun rejected Trump's accusations against China as ""baseless"" and said ""lies repeated a thousand times are still lies.""
Trump and Xi, leaders of the world's two largest economies, laid out competing visions at a time when relations have plunged to their worst level in decades, with coronavirus tensions aggravating trade and technology disputes. 
Trump, facing a November re-election battle with the United States dealing with the world's highest official number of deaths and infections from the coronavirus, focused his speech on attacking China. 
He accused Beijing of allowing people to leave China in the early stages of the outbreak to infect the world while shutting down domestic travel.
""We must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world, China,"" he said in remarks taped on Monday and delivered remotely to the General Assembly due to the pandemic.
""The Chinese government, and the World Health Organization – which is virtually controlled by China – falsely declared that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission,"" he said.
""Later, they falsely said people without symptoms would not spread the disease ... The United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions.""
The president promised to distribute a vaccine and said: ""We will defeat the virus, and we will end the pandemic."" 
'GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER'
Xi's address contained what appeared to be an implicit rebuke to Trump, calling for a global response to the coronavirus and a leading role for the WHO, which the U.S. president has announced plans to leave.
""We should enhance solidarity and get through this together,"" he said. 
""We should follow the guidance of science, give full play to the leading role of the World Health Organization and launch a joint international response ... Any attempt of politicizing the issue, or stigmatization, must be rejected.”
The WHO rejected Trump's remarks. 
""No one gov't controls us,"" its communications director, Gabby Stern tweeted, adding: ""On Jan. 14 our #COVID19 technical lead told media of the potential for human-to-human transmission. Since February, our experts have publicly discussed transmission by people without symptoms or prior to symptoms.""
Russian President Vladimir Putin told the General Assembly the WHO should be strengthened to coordinate the global response to the pandemic and proposed a high-level conference on vaccine cooperation.
China has portrayed itself as the chief cheerleader for multilateralism at a time when Trump's disregard for international cooperation has led him to quit global deals on climate and Iran, as well as the U.N. Human Rights Council and the WHO.
Xi took an apparent swipe at Trump's ""America First"" policy in a statement on Monday to a meeting celebrating the U.N.'s 75th anniversary.
""No country has the right to dominate global affairs, control the destiny of others, or keep advantages in development all to itself. Even less should one be allowed to do whatever it likes and be the hegemon, bully or boss of the world. Unilateralism is a dead end,"" he said.
The U.S. coronavirus death toll surpassed 200,000 on Monday, by far the highest official number of any country.
Trump also attacked China's record on the environment, but leveled no direct criticism at Beijing over human rights. 
Trump, a frequent critic of the U.N., said that if it was to be effective, it must focus on ""the real problems of the world"" like ""terrorism, the oppression of women, forced labor, drug trafficking, human and sex trafficking, religious persecution, and the ethnic cleansing of religious minorities.""
In his U.N. address, French President Emmanuel Macron called for an international mission under U.N. auspices to visit China's Xinjiang region to look into concerns about alleged abuses of Muslims there.
China's envoy Zhang Jun issued a statement in response to Trump's remarks, accusing the United States of ""abusing the platform of the United Nations to provoke confrontation and create division.""
In his speech, Xi announced plans to boost China's Paris climate accord target and called for a green revolution, just minutes after Trump blasted China for ""rampant pollution.""
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world was ""moving in a very dangerous direction"" with U.S.-China tensions. 
""We must do everything to avoid a new Cold War,"" he said. ""Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a Great Fracture — each with its own trade and financial rules and Internet and artificial intelligence capacities.

""A technological and economic divide risks inevitably turning into a geo-strategic and military divide. We must avoid this at all costs.""

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast's ruling party said on Tuesday it will push ahead with the October election regardless of whether the opposition participate, comments likely to deepen political tensions in the world's top cocoa producer.
At least a dozen people have been killed since riots broke out last month after President Alassane Ouattara declared he would run for a third term, following the sudden death of his handpicked successor in July.
Last weekend, Ouattara's main challenger Henry Konan Bédié called for civil disobedience and reform of the electoral commission and the constitutional court, but opposition parties have stopped short of saying they would boycott the poll.
""We will go to the presidential elections in October with or without the opposition. President Ouattara is ready and will go to these elections alone if necessary,"" Adama Bictogo, executive director of Ouattara's party, told journalists.
The opposition has said that Ouattara, who has been in power for a decade, is violating the constitution by seeking another term. The 78-year old president says a constitutional change means his two-term limit has been reset.
Ivory Coast's Constitutional Council has cleared Ouattara, former president Bedie and two other candidates to contest in the vote.
""The opposition is not ready to go to the elections and is using tricks to delay or postpone them. There will be no postponement,"" Bictogo said.

The recent violence sparked memories of 2010-11, when 3,000 people died in the civil war in the country - the world's top producer of cocoa.

GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (Reuters) - Ecuador's navy said on Tuesday that Chinese fishing vessels have gradually left the area near the Galapagos (NASDAQ:GLPG) Islands and are now operating in international waters off Peru, following months of fishing that spurred criticism from environmental groups.
More than 300 vessels arrived in June to the area around the Galapagos, one of most biodiverse in the world, to fish for giant squid in international waters.
""We have done the monitoring and we know that they are in offshore waters off the Exclusive Economic Zone of Peru, in its southern part,"" Ecuadorean Commander of Naval Operations Rear Admiral Daniel Ginez, said in an interview. ""We know they are there, we have them monitored.""
Since 2017, Chinese vessels have been spending the summer months on the outskirts of the protected area of ​​Galapagos, home to marine species including some that are endangered.
This year's fleet was larger than those registered in previous years, Ginez said.
""With such a large number of fishing boats we have the risk that certain species are diminished,"" explained Ginez.
""We need to identify measures that allow us to avoid the presence of such a large number of fishing vessels, which without a doubt can be classified as vessels that are preying on fishing resources.""
Environmentalists say this type of fishing takes advantage of species that cross into the high seas from the protected waters around the islands, which served as the basis for 19th century British scientist Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.
No vessels of the fishing fleet entered Ecuadorean waters while operating near the Galapagos, Ginez said, adding that fuel was supplied by vessels belonging to the same fleet.
The fleet's presence led Ecuador to ask regional organizations for greater control over fishing in international waters. Ecuadorean officials have said some vessels turned off satellite communication systems, in violation of applicable fishing protocols.
China has promised a ""zero tolerance"" policy toward illegal fishing and has proposed a moratorium in the area near the Galapagos between September and November.

(Reuters) - A Louisiana megachurch pastor charged with repeatedly violating state coronavirus orders was denied entry to his court hearing Tuesday morning after refusing to wear a face mask.
Tony Spell, pastor of Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge, was charged in late March with violating stay-at-home orders implemented by Governor John Bel Edwards. His lawyer pleaded not guilty Tuesday morning while Spell remained outside.
Spell has made national headlines since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic for defying public health safety rules. He continued to hold church services despite restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people, including a Palm Sunday gathering he has claimed exceeded 1,000 congregants. 
Since then, his standoffs with authorities have grown increasingly heated. In April he was charged with aggravated assault and arrested after backing up a bus towards a protester standing outside his church. 
He has continued to hold boisterous church services for large, unmasked indoor congregations. ""We never said anybody wouldn't get sick, we never said anybody wouldn't die,"" he said in a recording of a Sept. 20 service posted by a local outlet called Central City News. ""We did say we would never close, even if we die."" 
In interviews with local media, Spell has downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic, telling The Advocate in May that 80,000 deaths were ""not a large number,"" and vowing not to heed state health restrictions.

Public officials have not released any data about whether any congregants at Life Tabernacle have been infected with the virus. The Advocate newspaper and other local outlets reported in April that a 78-year-old congregant had died after contracting the virus, a claim Spell disputed.

PARIS (Reuters) - Mali's military junta must restore power to civilians and arrange quick elections, France's president said on Tuesday, warning that the French role in fighting Islamist militants in the region would depend on it. 
Former Mali defence minister and retired colonel Bah Ndaw was named interim president on Monday while the leader of the junta that seized power last month, Colonel Assimi Goita, was appointed vice president. 
France, the former colonial power in Mali and now with some 5,100 troops fighting jihadists across the Sahel region, worries that the Aug. 18 military coup will set a dangerous precedent and undermine the campaign against militant Islam.
""They (the junta) must put Mali on the irreversible path of returning to civilian power and organise rapid elections,"" Macron said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly. ""France, like its African partners in particular, can only remain engaged on this condition.""
Despite France's military involvement and the support of the United States and some European powers, security has been progressively worsening since Paris intervened in 2013 to stop a jihadist advance to the Malian capital, Bamako.
Critics in the region have increasingly scorned Paris for failing to restore stability. Anti-French sentiment has grown as militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State have strengthened their foothold, making large swathes of the West African country ungovernable and stoking ethnic violence.
""The second these states want us to leave or consider that they can fight terrorism on their own, we will withdraw,"" Macron said. ""On this subject we will remain extremely vigilant.""

Several dozen people held an anti-French protest in downtown Bamako on Tuesday, the day Mali also celebrated the 60th anniversary of its independence from France. They chanted anti-French slogans and decried the presence of French troops in Mali, while some waved Malian and Russian flags.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's president told the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that the United States could impose ""neither negotiations nor war"" on the Islamic Republic amid heightened tension between the longtime foes over Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers. 
""Iran is not a bargaining chip in U.S. elections and domestic policy ... Any U.S. administration after the upcoming (U.S.) elections will have no choice but to surrender to the resilience of the Iranian nation,"" Hassan Rouhani told the annual U.N. gathering in a video message. 
The U.S.-Iranian confrontation has intensified since 2018 when President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers and unilaterally reimposed sanctions that have hobbled the Islamic Republic’s economy.
Trump wants a broader agreement with Tehran's clerical rulers that would further restrict Iran’s nuclear programme, halt its ballistic missile development work and end its support for proxy forces around the Middle East.
Iran has refused to hold talks with the United States unless Washington lifts sanctions on Tehran and returns to the original agreement. In retaliation for U.S. pressure, Tehran has scaled back compliance with nuclear capacity limits set by the deal.
In his U.N. address earlier on Tuesday, Trump said: ""We withdrew from the terrible Iran nuclear deal and imposed crippling sanctions on the world’s leading state sponsor of terror"". Iran denies supporting terrorism.
The Trump administration on Monday slapped new sanctions on Iran to support the U.S. assertion that all United Nations sanctions against Tehran that were lifted under the 2015 agreement are now reinstated. 
That move was rejected by key European allies as well as U.S. adversaries such as Russia and China who are all parties to the nuclear accord.
""This is a victory not just for Iran, but for the global community - during the transitional international order in the post-Western world - that an aspirant to hegemony is humiliated in such self-created isolation,"" Rouhani said, referring to the Trump administration. 
In his address to the General Assembly, French President Emmanuel Macron said the Trump's administration's ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Iran had so far failed. Macron dismissed U.S. efforts to restore U.N. sanctions against Tehran as Washington had already left the nuclear deal.

The government had earlier this month said only students who are taking their final examinations would return to school.
Tuesday's announcement by information minister Monica Mutsvangwa came after teachers unions said their members would boycott classes to press authorities to pay them a COVID-19 risk allowance and a pay rise.
Mutsvangwa said the first group of primary and secondary pupils would go back to class on Oct. 26 while the rest would follow on Nov.9.
Unions say that the government has not put enough measures in schools to combat COVID-19 and that they were not consulted on the re-opening schedule. 
Since schools closed in March to curb the spread of coronavirus, only pupils from the most wealthy families -- those sending their children to private schools or with access to the internet -- would have received any online lessons.
Zimbabwe has recorded 7,706 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 226 deaths.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian lawmakers cheered a crushing referendum victory that will cut their numbers - safe in the knowledge that their parliamentary life will probably be extended by the reform.
This week about 70% of Italians backed slashing the number of parliamentary seats to 600 from 945, in a reform championed by the co-ruling anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
Now constituency boundaries will have to be redrawn, a two-month-long process, and parliamentarians will think twice before triggering a new election.
""A smaller parliament is one with fewer places, so the current crop of lawmakers feel more threatened and will want to hang on to their seats,"" said Lorenzo Pregliasco, head of polling and political analysis firm YouTrend.
Maurizio Gasparri, a senator from Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party who has been in parliament for 28 years, said lawmakers would seek any excuse ""from a bad apricot harvest to the European soccer championships"" to avoid an early ballot.
In addition, regional elections ended with the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) keeping three of the seven regions at stake, while Matteo Salvini's rightwing League stole just one, failing to deal the fatal blow to the coalition government Salvini had promised.
The chances of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte serving to the end of his mandate in 2023 appear to have risen significantly. 
Spared constant worries about his government's survival, Conte can concentrate on trying to revive an economy brought to its knees by the COVID-19 crisis.
From 2021, Rome will get more than 200 billion euros ($234 billion) from the European Union's Recovery Fund designed to help the EU economies worst-hit by the coronavirus.
The ruling parties have every incentive to stick together to decide how to hand out the resources, reducing the risk of a new phase of political instability.
SALVINI'S DECLINE
Analysts say the electoral changes brought about by the referendum will go beyond the redrawing of constituency boundaries. 
Both the 5-Star and the PD have said they want to modify electoral rules to introduce a fully proportional system, a process that will require painstaking, drawn-out negotiations.
Former prime minister Matteo Renzi, who heads the Italia Viva party, a tiny but crucial part of the ruling majority, is already opposing talk of raising the voting threshold required for parties to win parliamentary seats.
Yet another obstacle to an early vote is a constitutional rule barring the president from dissolving parliament in the last six months of his mandate, which in President Sergio Mattarella's case means from end-July, early-August 2021.
""I think the only space for an early election is now a very narrow window between January and June 2021,"" Pregliasco said.
Salvini's declining fortunes offer further reassurance to Conte. After eight straight regional election victories in 2018 and 2019, the anti-immigrant politician appears to be losing his allure for many Italians.
The League remains Italy's most popular party, but polls suggest it has lost around 9 points since it won 34% of the vote at European elections in May. 
A similar fall in Salvini's personal approval ratings have prompted talk of a challenge to his party leadership from Luca Zaia, the popular head of the northern Veneto region.

In the regional election Zaia won 77% of the vote and his personal list of candidates got 45%. The League's official party list took just 17%.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - The mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, declared a state of emergency and closed much of downtown to vehicles on Tuesday ahead of an expected decision by a grand jury on whether to indict the police officers involved in killing Breonna Taylor, a Black medical worker, in a botched raid.
Although the timing of any decision remains unclear, courthouses, offices and restaurants were already boarded up on Tuesday in the mostly deserted blocks around the city's Jefferson Square Park, the site of regular demonstrations against police brutality that have spread across the nation. 
Concrete barriers ringed the area, with a handful of checkpoints manned by police who would only allow people with essential business to drive downtown. Pedestrians were free to walk the streets, but few did.
""Our goal with these steps is ensuring space and opportunity for potential protesters to gather and express their First Amendment rights,"" Mayor Greg Fischer, a white Democrat, said in a statement. ""At the same time, we are preparing for any eventuality to keep everyone safe."" He emphasized he did not know when any decision might come.
Taylor, 26, was killed shortly after midnight on March 13 when three plainclothes officers used a battering ram to force their way in to her Louisville home with a so-called no knock warrant. Fearing intruders, her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired a gun. The three officers fired their guns, striking Taylor five times.
Taylor's death, alongside that of George Floyd, a Black man who died in May after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck, helped spark a nationwide wave of protests demanding racial justice and an end to the use of excessive force by law enforcement.
Residents walking downtown's nearly empty streets on Tuesday said they were saddened by the boarded-up businesses.
""It breaks my heart,"" said Rena Brown, a 59-year-old retail worker and lifelong Louisville resident who recalled her parents would take the family shopping downtown when they had extra cash. ""The police officers that killed Breonna should be charged, tried, and let the jury decide their fate.""
Robin Sellers, 56, who works downtown in human resources, called it ""a depressing sight.""
Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Black Republican, has said his investigation into Taylor's death is ongoing, but has declined to confirm media reports that he is convening a grand jury to vote on whether to bring criminal charges against the officers.

The city's main federal courthouse has also been closed all week in an order by Chief Judge Greg Stivers of the Western District of Kentucky.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The British government has forwarded to U.S. authorities evidence in its possession regarding two accused Islamic State militants known as the ""Beatles"" being held by the U.S. military and suspected of involvement in beheadings of Western hostages.
In a court ruling on Tuesday, two British High Court judges rejected a request from the family of one of the accused which sought to block the transfer of evidence to the United States.
In a message posted on Twitter, Priti Patel, Britain's interior minister, confirmed the transfer of the evidence regarding alleged militants Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh to U.S. authorities.
""Pleased to say that the further evidence to support the prosecution of Kotey & El Sheikh has now finally been transferred to the US. I sincerely hope that justice for the victims and their families will now be served,"" Patel wrote.
The pair are suspected of membership in a four-strong Islamic State cell known as the Beatles because they were English speakers. The group is alleged to have detained or killed Western hostages in Syria, including U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig.
U.S. Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi said: ""We are pleased with the UK High Court’s decision and we are grateful that the British government has passed its evidence to us and confirmed its commitment to cooperate with our efforts to investigate and prosecute the two ISIS terrorists currently being held in U.S. military custody."" 
In a letter to Patel last month, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said that if Britain granted a mutual legal assistance request for evidence regarding Kotey and Elsheikh, U.S. prosecutors will not seek the death penalty in any cases against them and would not carry out executions if it were to be imposed.

The pair are being held by the U.S. military in an unidentified overseas location after being captured in 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping announced plans to boost his country's Paris climate accord target on Tuesday and called for a green revolution, just minutes after U.S. President Donald Trump blasted China for ""rampant pollution.""
Addressing the U.N. General Assembly, Xi said China would achieve a peak in carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060, the first time the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide has pledged to end its net contribution to climate change. 
""China will scale up its intended Nationally Determined Contributions (to the Paris agreement) by adopting more vigorous policies and measures,"" Xi said, urging all countries to pursue a ""green recovery of the world economy in the post-COVID era."" 
Xi used the lectern to call for multilateral action on climate change, drawing a stark contrast with Trump, who blasted China on its environmental record and for causing the coronavirus pandemic, and referred to withdrawing the United States from the ""one-sided Paris Climate Accord.""
Trump has referred to climate change as a ""hoax,"" and in 2017 pulled the United States out of the Paris accords laying out an international approach to global warming. Joe Biden, his Democratic presidential challenger and former vice president, has included climate change on his list of major crises facing the United States.
Trump, who has rolled back or pared down hundreds of environmental regulations, said the United States had reduced its carbon emissions by more than any country in the agreement. 
""Those who attack America’s exceptional environmental record while ignoring China’s rampant pollution are not interested in the environment. They only want to punish America. And I will not stand for it,"" Trump said. 
China had been aiming to bring its total greenhouse gas emissions to a peak by “around 2030,” while the European Union has asked Beijing to bring the date forward to 2025. 
Li Shuo, a veteran climate diplomacy expert at Greenpeace, said Xi’s climate pledge, minutes after Trump’s speech, was ""clearly a bold and well calculated move."" 

""It demonstrates Xi’s consistent interest in leveraging the climate agenda for geopolitical purposes,"" he said.

Senior military officials from the both countries met on Monday and exchanged ideas on their contested border, Chinese defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian said.
A joint press release issued by the Indian government in New Delhi said that both sides had agreed to ""avoid misunderstandings and misjudgments"", and ""refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground.""
""The two sides also agreed to hold the 7th round of Military Commander-Level Meeting as soon as possible,"" the release said.
Thousands of Indian and Chinese troops are currently amassed along a disputed stretch of border in the Ladakh region, bordering Tibet. 
After weeks of tensions, a stand-off in the remote western Himalayan region erupted into a bloody hand-to-hand clash in June in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed and China suffered an unspecified number of casualties.
Both countries have since said they are attempting to resolve the situation through diplomatic and military channels but talks appeared to have made little head-way so far.
Tensions remains high, with Indian and Chinese troops separated by only a few hundred meters in some areas and both sides bringing up reinforcements and supplies.
China and India said on Sept. 11 that they had agreed to de-escalate the situation and restore ""peace and tranquillity"" following a high-level diplomatic meeting in Moscow.
Both sides agreed at the time that troops from both sides should quickly disengage and ease tensions.
The nuclear-armed neighbours have not been able to agree on their 3,488-km-long border, despite several rounds of talks over the years. The two countries fought a brief but bloody border war in 1962 and distrust has occasionally led to flare-ups ever since.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's Supreme Court must establish whether a judge or the attorney general's office is responsible for deciding the future of a house arrest order against ex-president Alvaro Uribe, a magistrate said on Tuesday.
Uribe and several allies are being investigated for allegedly engaging in witness tampering in an attempt to discredit allegations the former president had ties to right-wing paramilitaries.
Uribe's lawyer had asked a judge to free him while the case continues. The judge said in a hearing she could not rule on the motion until the high court, which was in charge of the case until earlier this month, determines whether she or the attorney general's office had authority over the decision.
Uribe, a mentor to current President Ivan Duque, had been serving as a senator but resigned after the August house arrest order, while insisting on his innocence. 
The resignation led the court, charged with investigating cases involving lawmakers, to transfer the case to the attorney general's office, which critics have alleged will be less rigorous than the court.
Tuesday's development is the latest twist in a years-long legal saga between the right-wing Uribe, who was president between 2002 and 2010, and leftist Senator Ivan Cepeda.
In 2012, Uribe accused Cepeda of orchestrating a plot to tie him to right-wing paramilitary groups.
But in 2018, the Supreme Court said Cepeda had collected information from former fighters as part of his work and had not paid or pressured former paramilitaries. Instead, it was Uribe and his allies who pressured witnesses, the court said.

Duque has called Uribe's house arrest unfair, comparing it to former rebel leaders who have been allowed to remain free during war crimes proceedings. They received special terms under a peace deal reviled by Uribe.

The investigation into the girl's disappearance 13 years ago is now focused on a 43-year-old German identified as Christian B., named by the prosecutor in June.
Madeleine vanished from her bedroom on May 3, 2007 during a family holiday in the Algarve while her parents dined with friends in the resort of Praia da Luz. 
In June, prosecutors in the German city of Braunschweig made a public appeal for clues to help them find concrete evidence against Christian B., who had been living in the Algarve at the time and had a string of prior convictions.
On Tuesday, the prosecutor said he had started his own investigation at the end of June into the case of a young Irish woman after the victim spoke to British media about being raped at knifepoint nearby.
""(The investigations) are ongoing,"" said Hans Christian Wolters, adding the case was not as extensive as Madeleine's and not all the files from Portugal had been submitted.
According to Portuguese court documents seen by Reuters, Irish babysitter Hazel Behan, 20, reported to Portuguese police that she had been raped in June, 2004. 
The victim woke up with a man she did not know wearing black gloves and a hood standing next to her with a knife to her neck, say the documents. He raped her on a table and tied her up with rope. He took photographs of her and cut her clothes with scissors.
The victim gave a physical description of the attacker and said he spoke English but sounded German, Belgian or Dutch.
Christian B. is in a prison in Kiel serving a sentence for drug dealing but has been seeking parole.

Between January and June this year, 81 social, political and community leaders were killed in Colombia, up from 61 in the first half of last year even though incidents of violence and attacks fell 2%, according to a study by local civil rights group the Electoral Observation Mission (MOE).
The report did not specify which armed groups were responsible for the murders, attacks and threats. The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.
The government accuses left-wing guerrillas from the National Liberation Army, ex-members of the FARC rebels who reject a 2016 peace deal and criminal groups of former right-wing paramilitaries of attacking activists as the groups seek to control drug trafficking and illegal mining areas. 
Though the South American country of 50 million people had a national quarantine in place from late March until the end of August, violence in remote areas against social, political and community leaders did not let up, the report said. 
The attacks have become one of the main challenges for the government of President Ivan Duque, with advocacy groups and critics in the international community calling for action. 
""Local leaders continue to be victims of violence at the hands of armed groups and other actors who hold different economic, political, social and environmental interests,"" MOE director Alejandra Barrios said in the report.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Vatican officials have defended their intention to renew an accord with Beijing that gives the pope say over the appointment of Chinese bishops, following a highly unusual public call from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to abandon it.
In a series of Tweets and an editorial in a conservative U.S. Catholic journal published on Saturday, Pompeo said the Vatican should not renew the agreement, which was signed two years ago and expires next month.
""The Vatican endangers its moral authority, should it renew the deal,"" Pompeo Tweeted.
Three senior Vatican officials who spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity said the Holy See was taken aback by the comments by Pompeo, who is due to visit the Vatican at the end of this month.
Pope Francis has signed off on a two-year extension of the agreement with Beijing, which allows the pope final say over the appointment of bishops in China and also permits Chinese Catholics to recognise him as leader of the universal Church.
Before the deal, the state-backed official Catholic Church in China was barred from recognising the authority of Rome, while an underground, unofficial Church continued to do so.
Some conservative critics have condemned the deal as a sell-out to the communist government. President Donald Trump, who faces re-election in November, has campaigned on his willingness to take a tough line with China, and also has support among conservative Christians who have clashed with the pope.
In a Tweet, Archbishop Mark Coleridge of Brisbane, Australia, criticised Pompeo's comments as an ""attempt to pressgang the Holy See into a questionable domestic political/electoral agenda playing itself out on the international stage.""
Pompeo said that since the Vatican's deal with Beijing was reached, the conditions for Christians in China had worsened. 
""Now, more than ever, the Chinese people need the Vatican's moral witness and authority in support of China's religious believers,"" he said in an editorial in First Things journal.
In a clear comparison between Francis and Pope John Paul II, a hero to conservatives, Pompeo said the Church had inspired movements in Communist Eastern Europe that helped bring down the Berlin Wall in 1989.
""That same power of moral witness should be deployed today with respect to the Chinese Communist Party.""
NOT NORMAL DIPLOMACY
One of the senior Vatican sources said the Holy See was ""surprised"" about Pompeo's intervention, given his coming visit.
""This is not a normal way to go about setting an agenda. Normally between ministries you have confidential exchanges to determine what is going to be on the agenda.""
The Vatican had spoken to U.S. officials about the comments but was not planning to make a public comment about it, one of the sources said.
The journal in which the editorial appeared has been highly critical of Pope Francis. Last year, its editor wrote a long commentary titled ""A Failing Papacy"".
The three Vatican officials said the China deal was not perfect but gives the Vatican a direct channel for dialogue with Beijing after a break of nearly 70 years.
""Maintaining dialogue is one of the few, if not the only, tool of maintaining direct relations with China,"" one said.

In response to Pompeo's suggestion that the Vatican should take a tougher line, another one of the officials said: ""We can make grandiose statements, but there is no indication that it will have any effect, except possibly making the situation worse for our Catholics on the ground.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The level of violence in Afghanistan is unacceptably high and the United States expects further setbacks during talks, the Special Representative for Afghanistan said on Tuesday, as the Afghan government and Taliban remain far apart on even the most basic issues 10 days into talks meant to end two decades of war.
""By any measure, current levels of violence are too high,"" U.S. Special Envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad told a House of Representatives hearing.
""We know that reductions are possible,"" Khalilzad said.
Despite the difficulties, the talks are the best hope for peace in years and come as a result of a February pact between the Taliban and United States, allowing U.S. forces to withdraw in exchange for Taliban promises on terrorism.
But the militant group has refused to agree to a ceasefire and the war is grinding on. At least 57 members of the security forces have been killed in recent days in clashes across Afghanistan.
With all foreign troops due to be gone by May 2021, pressure is building on the U.S.-backed government in Kabul as it grapples with how to share power with its implacable foe or contend with a likely Taliban push for military victory.
Since the spotlight faded from the lavish Sept. 12 opening ceremony in the Qatari capital, Doha, attended by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the two sides have only confirmed that they are diametrically opposed on virtually every issue.
""While we have reasons to be hopeful, we are under no illusions about the challenges ahead. ... We expect that there will be setbacks and obstacles,"" Khalilzad said.
The United States is expected to reduce troop levels to 4,000 to 5,000 in the coming months and will look at further reductions based on conditions. 
David Helvey, who is performing the duties of assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, told the subcommittee hearing focusing on national security the Pentagon was carrying out ""prudent planning"" to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by May 2021 if conditions were met.

He added that for now Defense Secretary Mark Esper had not issued any orders to go below 4,000 troops.

""We will continue to narrow differences and resolve disputes with others through dialogue and negotiation. We will not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in zero sum game,"" Xi said in a pre-recorded video statement to the annual gathering of world leaders, conducted virtually this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Long-simmering tensions between the United States and China hit boiling point over the pandemic, spotlighting Beijing's bid for greater multilateral influence in a challenge to Washington's traditional leadership.
The coronavirus emerged in China late last year and Washington accuses Beijing of a lack of transparency that it says worsened the outbreak. China denies the U.S. assertions.
In what appeared to be a rebuke to U.S. President Donald Trump, though both leaders' speeches were pre-recorded, Xi called for a global response to the virus and giving the World Health Organization a leading role.
Trump has announced plans for the United States to leave the Geneva-based WHO, accusing the agency of being a puppet of China, a claim the WHO denied.
""Facing the virus, we should enhance solidarity and get through this together. We should follow the guidance of science, give full play to the leading role of the World Health Organization,"" Xi said. ""Any attempt of politicizing the issue or stigmatization must be rejected.""
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the 193-member General Assembly earlier on Tuesday that everything must be done to avoid a new Cold War, warning that ""we are moving in a very dangerous direction.""

""Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a great fracture,"" he said. ""A technological and economic divide risks inevitably turning into a geo-strategic and military divide. We must avoid this at all costs.""

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine must work ""constructively"" with the International Monetary Fund to secure 1.2 billion euros from the European Union to cope with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, the EU's top diplomat said on Tuesday. 
Threats to the independence of law enforcement bodies and the central bank have hobbled a $5 billion IMF deal since it was signed in June and raised red flags with Kyiv's main Western backers about progress on reforms. 
Criticism over the selection process of a new anti-corruption prosecutor also prompted a member of the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee to say Ukraine's prized visa-free access to EU countries was under threat. 
Western powers have backed Ukraine with aid and diplomatic support after the 2014 Maidan street protests ousted a Moscow-backed president and Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula, but they have repeatedly nudged Ukraine to move faster on reforms. 
""We also stand ready to provide 1.2 billion in macrofinancial assistance to help to limit the economic fallout that the coronavirus has created,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on a visit to Ukraine. 
""And Ukraine needs to constructively engage also with the International Monetary Fund and also the attached conditions about the rule of law of this help,"" he told reporters.
The deputy head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office said it was working on meeting the IMF's conditions and hoped to hold talks online with an IMF mission.
Asked whether the visa-free regime was under threat, Borrell said the EU had concluded at its latest review in July that Ukraine continued to meet the conditions for it to remain in place. 

But it also highlighted the need for ensuring ""the independence, effectiveness and sustainability of the anti-corruption institutional framework and avoid politicization of the work of all law enforcement agencies,"" he said.

If the improper procedures are confirmed, Ebrard said measures would have to be taken, without giving details. He called the abuse described in a whistleblower's complaint ""unacceptable.""
""This has to be cleared up. If it is confirmed it would be a major issue and not only punished but also other measures would be taken,"" he told a news conference. He said officials had so far spoken to six women, and that there could be more cases.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights investigator to Myanmar said on Tuesday an election set for November would fail to meet international standards because of the disenfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims.
Thomas Andrews, addressing the U.N Human Rights Council, said the polls could not be free and fair because of the exclusion of Rohingya of voting age living in the western Rakhine state and in refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh.
""The results of an election cannot accurately reflect the will of the people, when the right to vote is denied because of a person’s race, ethnicity or religion,"" he told the Geneva forum. 
""And, I have seen no evidence that the government is willing or prepared to facilitate the right to vote for hundreds of thousands of voting age Rohingya located in Rakhine State or in refugee camps in Bangladesh,"" he said.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar for Bangladesh in 2017 during a military-led crackdown the United Nations has said was executed with genocidal intent. The country denies the allegations and says it was targeting militants who attacked police posts.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya remain in Rakhine state where they are mostly confined to camps and villages.
Kyaw Tun, Myanmar’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told the U.N council the country's electoral body had ""set forth criteria for the elections to be free, fair, transparent, trustworthy and reflective of the desire of voters"".
He said the body had scrutinized applications to ensure all could patke part equally. 
""Every citizen without any discrimination who meets the criteria set in the election law can run for a public office,"" he said.
Of at least a dozen Rohingya who applied to run as candidates in the election, six were rejected after officials said they failed to prove their parents were citizens at the time of their birth, a requirement under the election law.
Myanmar does not recognise the term Rohingya or the community as an indigenous ethnic group.
Instead, they are derided as Bengalis, implying they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, despite tracing their history in Myanmar’s Rakhine State back for centuries.
Successive military governments that ruled Myanmar stripped the Rohingya of identity documents, leaving many with no proof of their origins.

Bolsonaro also defended his handling of the world's second-most deadly coronavirus outbreak after the United States. The far-right leader, who has repeatedly downplayed the gravity of the virus, lamented the deaths that have passed 137,200.
The Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest is experiencing its worst rash of fires in 10 years, while the Pantanal wetlands, the world's largest, has the most blazes ever recorded. 
Environmental advocates blame Bolsonaro for emboldening illegal ranchers and land speculators who set fire to land to increase its value for agricultural use.
The president rebutted the accusations and said Brazilian agriculture feeds one billion people in the world and that the country has the best environmental legislation.
""And yet we are the victims of one of the most brutal campaign of misinformation about the Amazon and the Pantanal,"" he said, without specifying what information was false.
His government has said criticism of its environmental policies are just a cover for protectionism in Europe, where farmers see Brazil as a competitor and businesses have threatened to boycott products from Brazil.
Bolsonaro said his government is still committed to concluding a free trade agreement between the European Union and the South American trade bloc Mercosur.
He blamed the media for ""politicizing"" the pandemic and causing panic among Brazilians by telling them to stay home, leading to ""social chaos"" while his government ""boldly"" took emergency economic measures to avoid a deeper crisis.
Environmental activists protested against Bolsonaro outside the U.N. headquarters on Monday. They carried banners that read ""Brazil in flames"" and ""No forest, No future"" to call attention to the destruction of the rainforest that scientists see as vital to curbing climate change.

Addressing the United Nations General Assembly in a video message, Erdogan said Turkey's primary preference was to solve disagreements ""justly and in an appropriate way"" through talks, but added that ""futile"" attempts to exclude Turkey from plans in the eastern Mediterranean could not succeed. 
NATO members Turkey and Greece are at odds over rights to potential energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean and the extent of their continental shelves. 
Tensions heated up last month when Turkey sent a seismic survey vessel to waters claimed by Greece and Cyprus, but they cooled a bit last week when Ankara recalled the ship in a move welcomed by Greece and the European Union. 

""I would like to reiterate our call to establish dialogue and cooperation with coastal states in the Mediterranean,"" Erdogan added. ""So we are proposing the holding a regional conference where the rights and interests of all coastal states are taken into consideration, and where Turkish Cypriots are present too.""

When the electricity generator runs out of diesel, nurse Mohammed al-Hattamy turns the blood-filtering machines by hand to prevent clots.
""We try to do our best,"" Hattamy said.
Northern Yemen, controlled by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement since it ousted the Saudi-backed government from power in Sanaa in late 2014, has suffered fuel shortages throughout a five-year war that has shattered Yemen's healthcare system.
Imports of fuel, needed for generators, water pumps and transporting goods, have dropped sharply in the past three months, the United Nations said, deepening a humanitarian crisis that has left 80% of Yemen's population reliant on aid.
The United Nations says fuel in the north's informal market is double the official price. Long queues at filling stations are common, and Ghazaaly said he paid an ""exorbitant"" amount for a taxi he eventually found willing to take him to hospital.
Imports into Houthi-held areas have to go through stringent controls imposed by a Saudi-led military coalition battling the group.
The Houthis accuse the coalition of waging economic warfare by holding U.N.-cleared commercial vessels which want to unload in the north. The coalition, which controls sea and air space, says it is preventing arms smuggling.
Two weeks ago, the Houthis suspended U.N and humanitarian flights to Sanaa in an apparent act of protest, further impacting aid provision as the ill-equipped country also battles the coronavirus pandemic. 
Testing and reporting of coronavirus cases in Yemen is low and the United Nations says the virus is circulating undetected.
Yemeni government authorities have declared 2,029 cases, including 586 deaths. Houthi authorities have not provided figures since May 16, when they reported four cases and one death.
Ahead of a possible second wave of the virus, the International Committee of the Red Cross this week opened a free 60-bed COVID-19 clinic in the southern port city of Aden, the Yemeni government's temporary capital. 
Fatima Elkendi, a volunteer doctor with a Yemeni charity, said it was hard to treat patients due to the lack of basic supplies.

""What's more, in Aden infectious diseases such as dengue fever and malaria are spreading. These diseases affect people greatly, due to the lack of proper nutrition and as most of the population is below the poverty line.""

Lebanon's Christian president, Michel Aoun, told fractious political leaders on Monday the country was heading ""to hell"" if a new cabinet was not formed swiftly to dig the nation out of its worst crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.
But the nation's sectarian politicians remain deadlocked over how to pick ministers to draw up economic reforms.
Politicians had told President Emmanuel Macron during his visit after a huge August explosion in Beirut that they would form a cabinet of experts in 15 days, accelerating a process that usually takes months. That deadline passed last week.
Nerves in the nation were further rattled on Tuesday after a blast rocked southern Lebanon. A security source said it occurred at an arms depot of Hezbollah, a heavily armed and politically powerful Shi'ite Muslim group.
Political talks have hit a logjam over a demand by Hezbollah and its ally, Lebanon's other main Shi'ite group, the Amal Movement, that they name several ministers including the finance minister.
The source said Paris was reluctant to set a new deadline and was instead giving politicians more time provided they worked towards a French demand for a cabinet of ministers with expertise to deliver reforms.
""France is letting them move forward, but within a reasonable timeframe,"" the French source told Reuters. 
France has said it was ready to host an international conference in the second half of October to secure aid from donors, who demand reforms before giving cash. Paris has drawn up a roadmap for a new government to tackle corruption and rebuild the economy.
But there has been no indication that Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib, a Sunni under Lebanon's sectarian system of power sharing, is any closer to naming a cabinet.
A senior Shi'ite political source said the two main Shi'ite groups insisted on choosing the finance minister or they would not take part in a government, a move that would likely mean any government policies would be blocked once sent to parliament.
""Everyone is waiting,"" said another source familiar with the cabinet process. ""I don't think the French initiative is dead.""

The prizes, due to be announced next month, will instead be handed out during a televised ceremony in December with laureates receiving their awards in their own countries. 
The Nobel Foundation had already cancelled the glittering banquet which marks the end of the annual festivities in December. It was the first time since 1956 that the banquet had been cancelled. 
""We had decided already in spring that we would not have a traditional prize ceremony,"" Nobel Foundation Chairman Lars Heikensten told news agency TT. ""But we wanted to wait over summer to see what would happen before we communicated that.""
He said that each laureate would receive their prize either at a Swedish embassy or the institution where they work. 
The ceremony for the high-profile Peace Prize takes place in Oslo as it is chosen by a Norwegian committee.
The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were created and funded in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901.

More than 5,850 people in Sweden have died in the COVID-19 pandemic, far more in relation to the size of its population than in the rest of the Nordic region, though less than countries such as Britain and Spain.

The security source said the arms depot blast, which sent a huge column of black smoke into the sky, was caused by a ""technical error"".
The explosion rocked the village of Ain Qana in south Lebanon, a political stronghold of the heavily armed and politically powerful group which has fought wars with neighbouring Israel.
The blast has further rattled a nation grappling with its worst crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war and still reeling from a devastating explosion at Beirut port that ripped through the capital, killing at least 190 people.
Since the Beirut blast on Aug. 4, subsequent fires at the port and elsewhere in the capital have caused panic in Beirut and the country, whose economy is in meltdown.
Another security source said Hezbollah had set up a security cordon around the blast site, about 50 km (30 miles) south of Beirut. Journalists were prevented from approaching the area.
There was no immediate statement from Hezbollah.
Security sources said there were several injuries without giving figures.
A witness near the village said they felt the ground shake.
Footage from the area broadcast by Al-Jadeed showed men walking over scorched ground littered with debris. Damage was shown in an adjacent house where the floor was covered in glass and what appeared to be a pool of blood.

At least one fire was still burning in the location, the footage showed.

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic played down hopes on Tuesday that a U.S.-mediated agreement on economic cooperation with Kosovo could lead soon to a political deal with the former province.
Political normalisation with Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 nearly a decade after it was protected by NATO in a bombing campaign, is a pre-condition for Serbia's entry into the EU.
Serbia and Kosovo agreed to take steps towards economic cooperation, including working on joint infrastructure projects, in agreements signed at the White House this month, which U.S. President Donald Trump called a ""breakthrough"".
In his first interview with a Western news organisation since his trip to Washington, Vucic described the agreements as a big step in the right direction, but a long way from political normalisation.
""I think such agreements are very important in order to preserve peace and that once and for all we resolve our problems to have clear future for our children,"" Vucic told Reuters. 
""I am not saying that we are close to a political solution,"" Vucic said, though he described economic cooperation as ""key"" for any future political deals.
On Tuesday, a U.S. delegation headed by Trump's special envoy for talks between Serbia and Kosovo, Richard Grenell, arrived in Serbia to discuss possibility of financing projects.
The delegation visited Kosovo on Monday.
'ARGUMENTS WITH EVERYONE EQUALLY'
Vucic, a former ultra-nationalist who pivoted towards a pro-European stance in 2008, is determined to bring his country into the EU, which requires some form of accommodation with Kosovo.
Serbia and its ally Russia reject Kosovo's declaration of independence. EU-mediated normalisation negotiations broke down in 2018 but resumed in July after Kosovo lifted import tariffs on Serbian goods.
In his interview, Vucic described a future for his country that would involve balancing ties with East and West, even if this meant occasionally angering both sides.
""If you live in a small country which is geographically at the crossroads, then your policy should be maintain peace and stability, either by not having arguments with anyone, which is impossible, or having arguments with everyone equally,"" he said.
""Serbia is on its European path, but Serbia has to live, and has friends in the U.S. but it also has friends and it is not ashamed of them in Moscow and in Beijing.""
Serbia accepted highly publicised offers of aid from China in fighting the coronavirus this year, annoying some European countries who saw the gesture as politicised.
More recently, Vucic risked friction with the Kremlin by steering clear of joint military exercises in Belarus, refusing to be drawn into a show of support for embattled leader Alexander Lukashenko, a Russian ally.
""Sometimes we have to protect our military neutrality by being all alone,"" Vucic said.
Vucic said he hoped Trump would visit Serbia.
His delegation was warmly met in the United States, long the main supporter of Kosovo's independence, and the trip irked Moscow. Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman compared Vucic's White House visit to an explicit film scene, prompting Vucic to accuse Moscow of stooping to ""primitivism and vulgarity"".

In Washington, both Kosovo and Serbia also agreed to move their embassies in Israel to Jerusalem, a Trump administration priority. Vucic said Serbia's chamber of commerce would open in Jerusalem first, with the embassy move to follow.

RAMALLAH, West Bank/GAZA (Reuters) - Palestine has quit its current chairmanship of Arab League meetings, the Palestinian foreign minister said on Tuesday, condemning as dishonourable any Arab agreement to establish formal relations with Israel.
Palestinians see the accords that the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed with Israel in Washington a week ago as a betrayal of their cause and a blow to their quest for an independent state in Israeli-occupied territory.
Earlier this month, the Palestinians failed to persuade the Arab League to condemn member nations breaking ranks and normalising ties with Israel.
Palestine was supposed to chair Arab League meetings for the next six months, but Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki told a news conference in the West Bank city of Ramallah that it no longer wanted the position.
""Palestine has decided to concede its right to chair the League's council (of foreign ministers) at its current session. There is no honour in seeing Arabs rush towards normalisation during its presidency,” Maliki said.
After initial remarks, Maliki read from a letter he said he sent to Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit informing him of the Palestinian move and criticising the UAE and Bahrain, both Gulf Arab nations that share Israeli concerns about Iran.
The UAE's deal with Israel ""created a deep crisis in the Arab League"" and the accord was followed ""by a similar collapse by the Kingdom of Bahrain"", Maliki said, quoting from the letter.
In a new move addressing internal Palestinian divisions, officials from West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah faction and the Islamist Hamas movement were due to hold reconciliation talks in Turkey on Tuesday.

Hamas seized the Gaza Strip in 2007 from Fatah forces during a brief round of fighting. Differences over power-sharing have delayed implementation of unity deals agreed since then.

Investors are bracing for an extended period of market volatility as worries over political uncertainty and the coronavirus roil stocks.
The Cboe Volatility Index, known as ""Wall Street's fear gauge,"" hit its highest level in nearly two weeks on Monday. VIX futures show that investors are betting that market swings will persist beyond the presidential election and into December, reflecting the possibility of a contested election and concerns that a deeply divided government will fail to agree on providing more fiscal stimulus to support the U.S. economy.
GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
Trump officials are rushing to introduce new laws that would make it tougher for skilled foreign workers to gain U.S. visas. A fast-track regulation under review would narrow the definition of a ""specialty occupation"" eligible for a skilled-worker visa under the H-1B program. Trump has made immigration a focus of his campaign.

U.S. authorities arrested a woman on the Canada-U.S. border on Sunday, at the so-called Peace Bridge that runs between Fort Erie, Ontario, and Buffalo. 
She is due to make her initial appearance at U.S. District Judge H. Kenneth Schroeder Jr. at 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT). She has yet not been officially identified.
The envelope was intercepted at a government mail center before it arrived at the White House, Canadian police said on Saturday.
Canadian police on Monday searched an apartment in a Montreal suburb linked to the woman. She has joint Canadian and French citizenship, two sources said.
The woman is suspected of sending a total of six letters, with the other five addressed to law enforcement and detention facilities in South Texas, according to a U.S. law enforcement source.
So far no links to political or terrorist groups have been found, but the investigation is ongoing, the source said. 
The police department in Mission, Texas, received a suspicious letter within the last week, Art Flores, a spokesman for the department, said on Monday. The department did not open the envelope and turned it over to the FBI, he said.
Flores also said the Mission police had arrested the woman now believed to be held in Buffalo in early 2019.

Callamard, speaking on a panel, read out a statement issued by 32 U.N. experts in late June, which she told Reuters ""is as relevant as ever"" as the Human Rights Council meets in Geneva.
Tens of thousands of people in the Philippines may have been killed in the war on drugs since mid-2016 amid ""near impunity"" for police and incitement to violence by top officials, the United Nations said in a landmark report in June. 
The chief presidential legal counsel and presidential spokesman did not respond immediately to Reuters' requests for comment. Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said last June that the ""rehashed claims"" of impunity were unfounded.
The U.N. report said the drugs crackdown, launched by President Rodrigo Duterte after he won election on a platform of crushing crime, has been marked by police orders and high-level rhetoric that may have been interpreted as ""permission to kill"". 
Callamard urged the 47-member forum to ""establish an on-the-ground international investigation"".
""I call on the International Criminal Court to prioritise the completion of its preliminary examination of the situation in the Philippines,"" she said. 
She urged states to ""apply sanctions against individual Filipino officials who have committed, incited or who have failed to investigate or prevent human rights violations including arbitrary killings.""
Iceland, working with the Philippines, is proposing a resolution for consideration at the Council next week. But activists said that the draft text, which calls for technical cooperation, was weak as it fails to establish an international investigative mechanism.
""The Philippines is hell-bent on getting itself off of the Human Rights Council agenda by any means except for actually improving the human rights situation on the ground,"" said Laila Matar of Human Rights Watch.
Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Amnesty International researcher, said: ""Despite increased international attention over the years, killings continue and there appears to be no end in sight to the trail of blood.""

""Amnesty and others definitely believe that the situation meets the threshold of crimes against humanity,"" she said, urging the Hague-based ICC to complete its probe this year.

130,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 08:40AM ET</span>",Revealed: the darkness behind the beauty of Britain's great houses,"By Estelle Shirbon
LONDON (Reuters) - Feted for their fine architecture and often used as lavish backdrops for period movies, Britain's great estates came under the spotlight on Tuesday for a darker reason: their links to colonialism or slavery.
The National Trust, which runs some 300 heritage buildings, said about a third of them had past owners who had profited from slavery, opposed its abolition, been involved in colonial expansion or administration or promoted imperialism.
""These histories are sometimes very painful and difficult to consider,"" it said in a report. ""They make us question our assumptions about the past, and yet they can also deepen and enrich our understanding.""
The National Trust is a household name in Britain and promotes the properties it manages in England, Wales and Northern Ireland as family days out.
But like other British institutions from Lloyd's of London to Oxford University, the trust was jolted by this year's wave of anti-racism protests into a reckoning with the past that has led to statues being toppled and legacies debated.
The trust said its 115-page report, which was not exhaustive, would be used to ensure that links to colonialism and slavery were properly explained at relevant places.
But the report was met with an instant online backlash because among a list of 93 properties listed was Chartwell, Winston Churchill's home from 1922 until his death in 1965.
Churchill has long been revered as a British national hero for his leadership during World War Two, but his legacy in other areas has come under increasingly critical scrutiny.
The report noted that he had voted against a 1935 India Bill aimed at giving Indians greater autonomy from their colonial rulers, and cited the Bengal Famine of 1943, during which critics say Churchill denied food supplies to India.
Churchill biographer Andrew Roberts was among numerous people who went on social media to accuse the National Trust of ""wokery"". 
""WHITE MAN'S BURDEN""
Another notable item on the list was Glastonbury Tor, a hill topped by a 15th century tower, close to the site of the famous music festival. It was one of 29 properties that had benefitted from a government scheme that compensated slave owners when slavery was abolished in 1833, the report said.
No compensation was paid to former slaves, but 20 million pounds, or about 40 percent of the government's annual expenditure at the time, was set aside for former slave owners. The loan needed to fund the compensation was only fully repaid in 2015.
The imposing Basildon Park mansion, featured in the 2005 film adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" starring Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFayden, was also on the list.
It was purchased in 1771 by Francis Sykes, one of the so-called ""nabobs"", British merchants who made huge fortunes on the Indian subcontinent in ways that would now be considered exploitative.
The list also included Bateman's, home of writer Rudyard Kipling from 1902 until his death in 1936. Kipling, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907, is known for enduring works of fiction such as ""The Jungle Book"". 

But he was also an influential apologist for imperialism, as epitomised by his poem ""The White Man's Burden"" which suggested white people had a moral duty to civilise countries inhabited by people of other ethnicities.

The protest was called by Biya's rival Maurice Kamto of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement party, who hopes to spark a popular revolt, the likes of which have been seen in other African nations such as Mali and Burkina Faso.
Security forces have in recent days packed the streets of Cameroon's largest cities, including the capital Yaounde, in anticipation of the planned demonstrations, raising concerns among residents of a return to the kind of violent crackdowns that have met protests in recent years. 
Hundreds of people gathered in the busy Ndokoti commercial district of Douala on Tuesday morning chanting ""Biya must go!"". Police, camped out in trucks at major intersections, chased some of the protesters across the neighbourhood and into their houses, the witnesses said. 
Long a bastion of calm in a turbulent region, Cameroon has descended into chaos in recent years as Biya fights Islamist insurgents in its far north and separatist rebels in the west.
Biya is also under pressure from young political activists in urban centres who want change, and say the 87-year-old has stolen elections and is the mastermind of a series of deadly backlashes against those who oppose him. 
The Cameroon government denies those charges.

Biya won a 2018 election that his closest rival Kamto said was fraudulent. Kamto was jailed for nine months in 2019 on insurrection charges following a protest. He was later pardoned, but his arrest galvanised the opposition and has led to sporadic protests ever since.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government plans to execute William LeCroy, a convicted rapist and murderer, on Tuesday, the sixth in a spate of federal executions after a long hiatus in capital punishment.
The Department of Justice says it will kill LeCroy using lethal injections of pentobarbital, a barbiturate, at its execution chamber in Terre Haute, Indiana.
Under President Donald Trump, who took office in early 2017 and has long been an outspoken advocate for capital punishment, the federal government has executed more men than all of Trump's predecessors combined going back to 1963.
Another execution is planned for Thursday, when Christopher Vialva, a convicted murderer, is set to become the first Black man to face the federal death penalty under Trump. 
Trump's administration ended an informal 17-year-hiatus in carrying out the death sentence after announcing last year it would use a new one-drug lethal-injection protocol, replacing the three-drug protocol used in the last federal execution in 2003.
The new protocol revived long-running legal challenges to lethal injections. While a U.S. District Court judge, Tanya Chutkan, in Washington, D.C., last month sided with condemned men who sued the government, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the judge had made ""insufficient findings and conclusions"" in blocking the execution of Keith Nelson over an issue related to federal safety law on prescription drugs.
Chutkan has previously issued multiple orders halting planned executions while litigation continued, but which were soon overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, whose conservative majority said that legal challenges to pentobarbital injections, which are also used by several state governments to execute prisoners, were unlikely to prevail.
On Sunday, Chutkan declined to halt this week's executions, saying the government's violation of prescription laws did not itself amount to ""irreparable harm."" She also ruled that the question of whether a condemned man would still be conscious after injection of the caustic drug and suffer agony as his lungs filled with bloody fluid prior to death was ""one upon which reasonable minds could differ.""
LeCroy was convicted and sentenced to death in Georgia in 2004 for the carjacking, rape and murder of Joann Tiesler, a 30-year-old nurse, after breaking into her home. He was caught two days later in Tiesler's vehicle at the U.S.-Canadian border with notes scribbled on the back of a torn map, according to prosecutors. 

""Please, please, please forgive me Joanne,"" read one note by LeCroy, who misspelled the victim's name. ""You were an angel and I killed you. Now I have to live with that and I can never go home. I am a vagabond and doomed to hell.""

PABRADE, Lithuania (Reuters) - A new contingent of U.S. troops and armour will be deployed in Lithuania in November but their presence is not linked to the situation in neighbouring Belarus, Lithuania's defence minister said on Tuesday.
Belarus has undergone six weeks of protests since a contested Aug. 9 election which President Alexander Lukashenko said he won.
Since then, Lukashenko has accused NATO of a buildup near its borders, begun military drills near the borders with Lithuania and Poland, and put half his army on the highest state of readiness. 
More than 500 U.S. soldiers, about 25 Abrams tanks and about 30 Bradley armoured transports will replace a contingent that arrived in Lithuania on Sept. 4 for a two-month stay near the Belarus border. The new force will stay until mid-June 2021. 
Defence Minister Raimondas Karoblis said the U.S. military arrivals in Lithuania were not connected to the situation in Belarus.
Belarus military activity near the border has reduced this month compared to manoeuvres in August, Karoblis said.
""The U.S. presence makes us calmer, it's a powerful deterrent, but it's not connected specifically to the situation in Belarus, rather to the geopolitical situation after Russia began its aggression in Ukraine and Georgia,"" Karoblis told reporters at the Pabrade Military Training Grounds.
Russia, which sees Belarus as a buffer state against the EU and NATO, supported Lukashenko and has accused the United States of fomenting revolution in its neighbour.
The U.S. ambassador to Lithuania, Robert Gilchrist, also said there was no connection between the troop presence and Belarus.

""It's about readiness, it's about working with our allies. There's no link (to Belarus),"" he said.

135,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. and UAE eye December goal to agree on F-35 deal,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and the United Arab Emirates hope to have an initial agreement on the sale of F-35 stealth fighter jets to the Gulf state in place by December, as the Trump administration studies how to structure a deal without running afoul of Israel.
Sources close to the negotiations said the goal is to have a letter of agreement in place in time for UAE National Day celebrated on Dec. 2.
Any deal must satisfy decades of agreement with Israel that states any U.S. weapons sold to the region must not impair Israel's ""qualitative military edge,"" guaranteeing U.S. weapons furnished to Israel are ""superior in capability"" to those sold to its neighbors.
With that in mind Washington is studying ways to make the  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) F-35 more visible to Israeli radar systems, two sources said. Reuters could not determine if this would be done by changing the jet or providing Israel with better radar, among other possibilities.
Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz was due to meet his U.S. counterpart Mark Esper in Washington on Tuesday.
The UAE embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment. 
A Pentagon spokeswoman told Reuters, ""as a matter of policy, the United States does not confirm or comment on proposed defense sales or transfers until they are formally notified to Congress.""
Once a letter of agreement is signed, a fine may be levied against any party that terminates the deal. Several political and regulatory hurdles must be cleared before the sale may be completed and Capitol Hill aides cautioned a deal may not be possible this year.
Ellen Lord, the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, told reporters in August that in general, the United States aims to complete a letter of agreement for new F-35 sales in about six months.
Because of the qualitative military edge restriction, the Lockheed Martin-made F-35 has been denied to Arab states, while Israel has about 24 jets.
The United Arab Emirates, one of Washington's closest Middle East allies, has long expressed interest in acquiring the stealthy jets and was promised a chance to buy them in a side deal made when they agreed to normalize relations with Israel.
Sources familiar with the negotiations said a working idea was for Israeli air defenses to be able to detect the UAE F-35s with technology that effectively defeats the stealth capabilities of the jets.
F-35 fighter jets sold to the United Arab Emirates could also be built in a way that ensures the same planes owned by Israel outperform any others sold in the region, defense experts say.
Washington already demands that any F-35 sold to foreign governments cannot match the performance of U.S. jets, said both a congressional staffer and a source familiar with past sales.
The F-35's technical sophistication is tied to its mission systems and processing power and ""it's the computing power that allows you to sell a higher tech jet to Israel than to the UAE,"" said Doug Birkey, executive director of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in Washington.
""When foreign pilots are in training in the U.S. they type a code into a user interface as they board the jet, the code will pull a different jet for each pilot based on legal permissions,"" Birkey said.

Either way, actual delivery of new jets is years away. Poland, the most recent F-35 customer, purchased 32 of the jets in January, but will not receive its first delivery until 2024.

The Geneva-based body has said that 156 nations have joined the so-called COVAX plan to deliver some 2 billion vaccine doses globally by the end of next year but big countries such as China, Russia and the United States are missing.
About 64 wealthy nations have signed up and more are expected despite missing an official deadline. However, some of those supporting the plan such as France are reluctant to use it to secure vaccines and have instead struck separate supply deals. 
""What we've announced is the beginning. It's going to continue,"" WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said, calling the number of sign-ups to date ""brilliant"". ""We all need to be in this together in order to finish this pandemic.""
She declined to comment on specific countries and said discussions were ongoing.
Asked to elaborate on delays to joining, Harris said some were due to paperwork and the need for parliamentary approval. 
Other countries, however, appear to have no intention of signing up.
A Russian government source told Reuters there was no need for his country to take part in the programme since it was developing and producing its own vaccine.
""Nevertheless, we do not rule out the possibility that our vaccine will in future be offered to participants of COVAX,"" the source said.
The Russian health ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
""China will continue to work with WHO, Gavi and relevant countries on vaccine development,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a news briefing on Tuesday.

At the same briefing, Harris said the WHO would make public a WHO internal app giving information on the pandemic which would include comprehensive global and regional overviews.

Schembri was arrested just after midnight, hours after a court issued an order for all his assets and those of his family and companies to be frozen, police sources confirmed.
Schembri, who has always denied wrongdoing, resigned in November, shortly before Muscat announced he was too was stepping down. 
The resignations followed the arrest and arraignment of Yorgen Fenech, suspected by police of being the mastermind in the 2017 murder of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Fenech has denied complicity in the killing.
Schembri had been a close friend of Fenech and attended meetings during which Muscat was briefed by the police on the murder investigations.
The allegations of kickbacks of up to 100,000 euros from passport sales and the laundering of the funds were made three years ago by then opposition leader Simon Busuttil. A magisterial inquiry into the allegations was concluded earlier in September but its outcome was not revealed. 
Malta started selling passports to wealthy foreigners in 2014, with strong take-up mostly from rich Russians, Chinese and others in the Arab gulf. 

In a court application through his lawyers shortly after his arrest, Schembri protested that he had not been made aware of the contents of the inquiry report.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican doubled down on its opposition to euthanasia on Tuesday, calling it an ""act of homicide"" that can never be justified or tolerated.
A new document, issued as more countries consider legalising euthanasia or assisted suicide, said legislators and politicians who support such laws are ""accomplices"".
Catholic healthcare workers must never give active or passive collaboration and governments the right to conscientious objection, it said.
The 20-page document, titled ""The Good Samaritan"" and written by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican's doctrinal office, incorporated past statements by the Roman Catholic Church on end of life issues but used tougher language.
""Euthanasia, therefore, is an intrinsically evil act, in every situation or circumstance,"" the document said. ""Euthanasia is an act of homicide that no end can justify and that does not tolerate any form of complicity or active or passive collaboration."" 
One section singled out lawmakers, saying that if they approve laws on euthanasia and assisted suicide they become ""accomplices of a grave sin that others will execute"".
Euthanasia involves a physician taking an active role in ending a patient's life whereas in assisted suicide, the doctor provides a lethal substance for the patient to self-administer.
Both are legal to various degrees in about 10 countries and several U.S. states.
In February, Portuguese legislators approved bills that would decriminalise euthanasia and assisted suicide. They have not yet become law. New Zealand is due to hold a referendum on both in October. 
The document called legitimatising euthanasia or assisted suicide ""a sign of the degradation of legal systems"".
In a section addressed to Catholic health workers, the document said their cooperation ""must be excluded"" because ""we must obey God rather than men"".

Governments ""must acknowledge the right to conscientious objection"" by health care workers, it said.

TEOTIHUACAN, Mexico (Reuters) - Among the many mysteries surrounding the ancient Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan, one has been especially hard to crack: how did its residents use the many signs and symbols found on its murals and ritual sculptures?
The city's towering pyramids reopened to visitors earlier this month as pandemic restrictions eased. But perhaps its most interesting and extensively-excavated neighborhood, featuring a patio floor with rare painted symbols, or glyphs, remains off-limits to tourists.
The discovery in the 1990s of the puzzling red glyphs, most laid out in neat columns, has led a growing number of scholars to question the long-held view that writing was absent from the city, which thrived from roughly 100 B.C. to 550 A.D.
Their ultimate ambition is to harness the steady drip of new finds to one day mimic the success their peers have had decoding ancient Maya or Egyptian hieroglyphics.
Teotihuacan – which lies in a dusty plain about 30 miles (50 km) outside the modern Mexican capital - was once the largest city in the Americas, home to at least 100,000 people.
Yet much is unknown about the civilization that inhabited it, including what language its native inhabitants spoke and whether they developed a system of writing akin to that of the Aztecs, who dominated the area some eight centuries later and revered its ruins.
Experts have debated several theories for the glyphs. They say they may have been used to represent symbols used to teach writing, or place-names of subjugated tribute-paying cities, or even as signs used in disease-curing rituals.
Art historian Tatiana Valdez, author of a book published this year on the glyphs of Teotihuacan, says the patio's 42 glyphs, many in linear sequences, amount to the longest text ever found at the city's ruins.
Overall, she says more than 300 Teotihuacano hieroglyphics have been tentatively identified so far.
Countless ancient Mexican codices - accordion-style folded paper books covered in hieroglyphics - were ordered burned in colonial times by Catholic authorities. Only about a dozen still exist. 
Valdez is convinced such books were also part of Teotihuacan's literary tradition, over a millennium before the bonfires. 
""I think Teotihuacan used hieroglyphics, and used them well because we've found so many,"" she said, pointing to thousands of mostly clay figurines with painted or incised glyphs that have been found on the site.
Valdez said the sheer number of figurines found with glyphs on tiny headdresses or on their foreheads could mean some access to writing was available to commoners.
Walking around La Ventilla, where the glyphs patio is located, is tantamount to exploring an ancient neighborhood, featuring temples, artisan workshops, intricate apartment compounds and finely painted murals.
The government-run National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) said additional work is still needed to be able to open it to tourists, but did not offer any timeline. 
The neighborhood's major excavations were completed years ago.
ELUSIVE TEXTS
Drawings and photos of the city's most recently confirmed glyph are set to be published in a scholarly paper next year. Found in 2016 on the back of a miniature stone altar, it features a triangle in a round cartouche with three dots underneath. The single glyph likely represents the specific year it was dedicated.
It is the kind of find expected by Joyce Marcus, an archeologist at the University of Michigan who has argued that writing was absent in the city.
""So far, we have not seen the long texts,"" she wrote in an email. 
""Writing is rare at Teotihuacan when its 'texts' are compared/contrasted with those at Maya sites,"" she added, pointing to the Mayan city of Tikal, a contemporary of Teotihuacan in present-day Guatemala. Tikal is home to monuments with columns of glyphs that in recent decades have been largely deciphered.
A painted mural uncovered in the 1960s in Teotihuacan shows what appears to be a priest holding a book. It was a ""hugely important"" discovery, said Christophe Helmke, a leading scholar of the city's writing system at the University of Copenhagen. 
He cautioned against expecting texts on public monuments or sculptures in the city, and said writing in Teotihuacan was probably mostly confined to its books.
He suggested future advances will likely come from new mural or ceramic finds, but not books, which are unlikely to turn up due to the speed of deterioration of the paper or animal skins used by ancient scribes.
David Stuart, a University of Texas archeologist and epigrapher who has pioneered the decipherment of ancient Maya writing, said the lack of knowledge about what language was spoken at Teotihuacan complicates efforts to read its glyphs.
""It's true that many still say that Teotihuacan had no writing system,"" he said. 

""But in fact it's there.""

World Food Programme (WFP) warned on Tuesday.
Militant attacks in gas-rich Cabo Delgado province, near the border with Tanzania, began in 2017. The violence has gathered pace in 2020, with insurgents seizing key towns for brief periods and hitting military and other key targets.
Operations and pitched battles in the region's remote villages between government forces and insurgents have often led to civilian casualties and destruction of infrastructure, with dozens of schools and homes burned down.
A WFP statement said over 300,000 people had fled Cabo Delgado to neighbouring provinces, in many cases crossing the northern border into Tanzania out of reach of humanitarian assistance.
""The latest findings from famine early warning system FEWSNET indicate that communities will continue to face 'crisis' levels of food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) into early 2021,"" the WFP statement said. ""The situation is even more worrisome given that Cabo Delgado has the second highest rate of chronic malnutrition in the country."" 
The UN body also warned that the migration caused by the violence risked accelerating the spread of coronavirus. The impoverished southern African nation has nearly 7,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 44 deaths. 
WFP said it needed $4.7 million per month to assist those internally displaced in northern Mozambique.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Until this year, West Africa looked to have shed its ""coup-belt"" moniker, winning plaudits as a model of democratic progress on the continent. But last month's putsch in Mali is fuelling fears among activists that gains of the past decade are unravelling.
The power grab came at a time when the presidents of Ivory Coast and Guinea are seeking third terms after winning referendums to alter constitutions that barred them from running again.
While elections are now held consistently across the region, such moves, combined with governments' attempts to stifle political opposition, are making many West Africans lose faith in the ballot box as a way of holding leaders accountable, activists and analysts say.
""We are asking for strong institutions. But while the institutions exist on paper, the politicians manipulate them from the inside until there's nothing left,"" said Veronique Tadjo, an Ivorian novelist who co-authored a manifesto against third terms. 
Political instability could further undermine security in a region where militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State are threatening to overrun state forces in inland countries like Mali and extend their influence into coastal nations like Ivory Coast.
Complaints that the March legislative elections in Mali lacked credibility were one factor behind last month's coup, and tinkering with term limits can also breed instability, experts said. 
More than a dozen people have been killed in protests in Ivory Coast since President Alassane Ouattara announced last month that he would seek a third term in October. His opponents called on Sunday for a fresh civil disobedience campaign. 
In Guinea, at least 30 people have died during demonstrations since last year against constitutional changes that allow President Alpha Conde to contest next month's vote. 
Both Ouattara and Conde say they have the right to run again, arguing that the new constitutions - approved in 2016 and this March, respectively - reset term limits. Their opponents dispute this. 
""In democracy, there is nothing more legitimate than the popular will expressed at the ballot box,"" Tibou Kamara, one of Conde's spokesmen, told Reuters. 
Conde, whom critics have long accused of angling for a third term, says he needs more time to carry out his development agenda, which was interrupted by the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak.
An Ivorian government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Ouattara said in March that he wouldn't be a candidate, but reversed himself after his preferred successor, Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly, died in July. Ouattara called the decision to run a ""true sacrifice"", necessary to protect the economic and social gains of his presidency. 
DOUBLE STANDARD? 
Already in 2019, West Africa showed the greatest decline in political rights and civil liberties of any region in the world, according to U.S. watchdog Freedom House, which cited flawed elections in Senegal and Nigeria and political crackdowns in Benin.
There is no single reason for the democratic backsliding, although several experts pointed to the waning influence of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) bloc.
In 2015, the 15-member body came close to banning third terms in what would have been a first for an African regional body. But analysts say ECOWAS failed to follow through on the issue, weakened by divisions between Francophone and Anglophone countries and regional powerhouse Nigeria's preoccupation with domestic concerns.
International powers such as the United States have become less outspoken on democracy issues, said Mathias Hounkpe, one of the experts commissioned by ECOWAS who recommended the two-term limit. 
""What we are experiencing today is a weakening of the position of the international community when it comes to liberal values,"" he said. 
ECOWAS leaders took a hard line against the Mali coup by immediately imposing economic sanctions.
Those measures, which were softened when some leaders demanded exceptions for fuel and other essential products, failed to force the junta to restore the deposed president. 
The coup leaders did, however, announce on Monday that a civilian interim president had been appointed, acceding to one of ECOWAS's main demands.
The bloc's actions have also drawn criticism from pro-democracy activists who see a double standard at play in its forceful condemnations of the coup, the second in Mali in eight years, but official silence on Ouattara and Conde's candidacies.
An ECOWAS spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.
Analysts say it is more difficult for ECOWAS to mobilise its members against constitutional changes that were approved by referendums and domestic courts than extra-legal coups. 
'CONTAGION EFFECT'
Analysts say they don't expect a return to the days of West African coups in the years after independence. The region also bears little resemblance to other parts of Africa, where some leaders have managed to cling to power for decades. 
In East Africa, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni will seek to extend his 34-year rule next year, while in Central Africa, Equatorial Guinea's Teodoro Obiang and Cameroon's Paul Biya have governed for even longer. 
Of ECOWAS members, only Togo's president has served more than two terms. Niger's Mahamadou Issoufou and Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari have both promised to step down after completing their second terms. 
But some other presidents could be toying with the idea of hanging on.
After previously ruling out a third term bid in 2024, Senegal's Macky Sall refused to confirm that position when asked by journalists last year, saying his ministers would stop working hard if he did.
On Sunday, the head of the majority in parliament, Aymirou Gningue, told a radio station that Sall has the right to run for a third term. Sall's spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
""It is always a contagion effect,"" said Christopher Fomunyoh, senior associate for Africa at the National Democratic Institute in Washington, citing previous waves of military coups and democratic reforms across the continent. 

""If the pendulum begins to swing backward, copycat actions ... (are) quite likely.""

Sebahat Tuncel was sentenced last week to 11 months and 20 days for calling Erdogan an enemy of Kurds and women in a speech in 2016, comments one of her lawyers defended as legitimate criticism of a political opponent.
Tuncel had served in Turkey's parliament for the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP). Her lawyer said her words had been taken out of context
""The defendant said that the president was an enemy of women and Kurds,"" said attorney Sivan Cemil Ozen.
Her statements were ""criticism of a political rival, which is within the boundaries of freedom of expression,"" she said.
In a July hearing, Tuncel denied the charge, saying she should be able to criticise a political opponent. The charges against her were an attempt to ""prevent freedom and thought, expression and organisation, especially the freedom of politics,"" she said.
Last year, Tuncel was jailed for 15 years for spreading terrorist propaganda and belonging to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is banned in Turkey and branded a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union. She had denied the charges.
Charges of insulting the president carry a maximum four-year prison sentence. Such cases rose by 30% in 2019, with 26,115 people investigated, some 5,000 facing court hearings and 2,462 jailed, according to data from the justice ministry.

On Monday, Sweden's state-owned space company said it would not renew contracts with China or accept new Chinese business due to changes in geopolitics. 
Since at least 2011, the Sweden Space Corporation (SSC) has had contracts giving Beijing access to its antennas in Sweden, Chile and Australia. It told Reuters those contracts would not be renewed.
There is at least a decade left on the contract for the Australian antenna, which has not been used or visited by working personnel from China for many years, state-backed tabloid Global Times reported, citing Chinese space insiders. 
The Australian antenna is located next to an SSC satellite station used mainly by the United States and its agencies, including NASA. 
China's contract in Australia started in 2009, and is ""good for decades,"" the insiders told the paper, published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party. 
China will renew its collaboration with SSC after the current contract expires, they added, without saying if that covered the Australian facility. 
SCC's global capabilities and management have attracted many countries and firms, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a regular briefing on Tuesday, when asked how politics had affected the contract. 
China last used the Yatharagga Satellite Station, 350 km (250 miles) north of Perth, in 2013, to support the three-person Shenzhou-10 mission which completed a series of space docking tests.
The Australian facility played a far less important role than the Kiribati ground station on that mission, the insiders said. 
Global Times said China's homegrown Beidou navigation system had inter-satellite links to reduce reliance on ground stations and ensure the continuity of high-precision global services.
Global Times did not mention the SSC contracts with China in Sweden and Chile.

BERLIN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German's Angela Merkel embarks this week on her third bold attempt to reshape European migration, but she faces an uphill task convincing other EU leaders to host refugees, even if her plan contains generous incentives.
Having taken in a million refugees in 2015 and struck a deal with Turkey to cut Mediterranean arrivals a year later, Merkel is the driving force behind a new European Union migration pact to be unveiled on Wednesday.
It seeks to share the task of accepting the hundreds and sometimes thousands of refugees arriving by boat every week - an idea that one EU official said Germany's veteran chancellor is hoping will serve as a cornerstone of her political legacy.
But the same states that, five years ago, rejected an EU quota system for refugees from Syria's war remain firmly opposed to accepting those who continue to flee conflict or poverty in parts of the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
""It's a strong proposal in support of Angela Merkel's call for EU solidarity. It's Merkel's legacy exercise,"" the official said. ""But it won't fly.""
Asked about the official's remarks, a German government spokesman said: ""We will comment on the European Commission's proposals once the Commission has published them.""
The plan would oblige each EU state to accept a number of refugees in return for 10,000 euros ($11,750) per adult taken in, funded from the bloc's budget, according to officials and diplomats familiar with Wednesday's policy blueprint.
Nations that fail to honour their commitments would face infringement proceedings in EU courts that could lead to hefty fines. But such penalties tend to take years to enforce.
The plan would also aim to step up returns - including by cracking down on visas for citizens of countries that refuse to take their nationals back - and support foreign states in managing migration before people reach Europe, among others.
The roughly 140,000 people who arrive in the EU seeking asylum each year represent a fraction of the 2 million who enter legally.
But Poland and Hungary, which have consistently objected to the principle of obligatory relocation, are likely to reject the proposal.
""We cannot accept the paradigm according to which solidarity is based on obligatory measures, including relocation,"" Poland's ambassador to the EU, Andrzej Sados, wrote on Monday in online newspaper Euractiv.
'NORMALISING THE DEBATE'
Merkel, who has said she will not seek re-election as chancellor when Germany votes in 2021, has already overcome stiff opposition in the EU this year, persuading the bloc's more frugal states to jointly borrow 750 billion euros for a pandemic recovery fund that includes non-repayable grants.
While the ink has yet to dry on that ground-breaking deal, she has the wind at her back diplomatically in Brussels and enjoys high domestic approval ratings, both on immigration and for her handling of the coronavirus crisis.
After opening Germany's doors to Syrian refugees back in 2015, she suffered electoral setbacks as the far right surged on anti-immigration sentiment.
But in a sign of the changing mood, German mayors offered this month to take in refugees after an overcrowded camp on the Greek island of Lesbos burnt to the ground. Protesters took to the streets in many German cities chanting ""We have space!"".
The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party is also drifting lower in opinion polls.
However, a clutch of EU states also including Austria, Slovenia and the Czech Republic remain either reluctant to endorse or firmly opposed to Merkel's push for solidarity. 
They say it would oblige them to host people who would harm the social fabric, burden state services and pose security risks.
That is one reason, officials say, why Merkel hesitated for a week before agreeing to take 1,500 of the 12,000 refugees made homeless by the Moria fire. In accepting them, she called on other EU members to also do their part.
So far, nine other EU states have agreed to accept 400 children from the camp. 
""We have to normalise the debate about migration,"" a second EU official said. ""Whatever difficult steps there are to be taken, it's easier to take them now, while the situation on the borders is not a crisis.""

MARSEILLE, France (Reuters) - David Fleyrat had almost cleared his Marseille hospital's intensive care ward of COVID-19 patients during the summer lull in new cases. Now the private unit is filling fast again and Fleyrat can barely conceal his frustration.
""It's not doing our job that is tiring. What's tiring is a second wave because people do not respect social distancing,"" Fleyrat, who is managing director of the private Clinique Bouchard-Elsan told Reuters.
Marseille is at the epicenter of a resurgence in novel coronavirus cases throughout France. Intensive care wards in the Mediterranean city's public hospitals are full and so hospitals like Fleyrat's are handling the spillover.
Some of France biggest cities outside of Paris, including Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have imposed new restrictions in an attempt to slow the virus' spread and reduce the number of intensive care admissions. Some 638 COVID-19 sufferers were admitted into ICU over the past seven days, official data shows.
For Nathalie Roche, a nurse in the clinic's COVID-19 unit, lessons learnt during the first wave bring reassurance, and there are none of the acute shortages of face masks and gloves that compounded the stress of the job in the spring. 
""But of course, psychologically, it's still an extra weight,"" Roche said of the increasing number of patients being brought in for life-saving treatment.
New coronavirus cases are spiraling in France, Spain, Britain and beyond in Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron is determined to avoid a second nationwide lockdown and says the country must learn to live with the virus.
But with no clarity on when a vaccine will be developed, his government is struggling to find the balance between allowing citizens to live their lives and containing the virus.
""During the first wave, staff were quite willing to venture into the unknown,"" intensive care doctor Jean-Gabriel Castagnedoli said. ""This time, the atmosphere is not the same. The staff are less willing, they don't want to relive it all.""

There were no reliable estimates of the number of people who were still missing after the three-storey building came down just before dawn on Monday, when many of the people in the 54 apartments would either of been getting up for work or school, or still in their beds. 
Satya Pradhan, the head of the National Disaster Response Force, tweeted an update on the search and rescue effort
in a series of grim bullet points:
""20 dead extracted
20 rescued alive

The rescue work was being conducted in difficult and risky conditions, according to Pradhan. Emergency service workers were removing debris by hand, or using digging equipment, but building was located in a cramped alley, making it hard to bring in heavy lifting equipment.
They were also contending with the risk of falling masonry, as loose slabs hung from those walls and ceilings still left standing. 
It was unclear why the building collapsed, but such disasters are commonplace in India during the monsoon season, as the torrential rains can destabilise old and often illegally constructed buildings.

Last month, more than a dozen people were killed when a building collapsed in the industrial town of Mahad, 165 km (100 miles) south of Mumbai.

PENGHU, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen praised on Tuesday the ""heroic performance"" of air force pilots who have been intercepting Chinese jets that have approached the island, as Beijing steps up military pressure on democratic Taiwan.
Tension between China and the island Beijing claims as sovereign Chinese territory have spiked to their highest in years, with Taiwanese fighters jets scrambling to intercept the Chinese aircraft last week.
Visiting a major air force base on Penghu in the sensitive Taiwan Strait that divides the two sides, Tsai told pilots and engineers she was aware of their ""heroic performance"" when intercepting and driving away Chinese aircraft.
""I have a lot of confidence in you. As soldiers of the Republic of China, how could we let enemies strut around in our own airspace?"" she said, using Taiwan's formal name.
""I'm aware that facing the provocative behaviour of the communist planes that have encircled the island and damaged regional peace in recent days, your duty at the front line of the airspace in Penghu must be even heavier."" 
The base, now home to F-CK-1 Ching-kuo Indigenous Defence Fighters (IDF) which first entered service in 1997, is at the front line of Taiwan's response to Chinese military intrusions.
Wang Chia-chu, one of the senior officers of the ""Heavenly Colt"" IDF squadron, told Reuters there is just five minutes' time to scramble fighters once Chinese aircraft are spotted.
""We will defend our airspace in real time as long as there's a threat,"" Wang said.
Another senior officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the Penghu-based IDFs are now scrambling ""almost every day"" as tension run high.
The air force also put on display its new Wan Chien air-to-ground cruise missiles that entered service in 2018 and can be fired from IDFs at targets about 200 km (125 miles) away, putting Chinese facilities or approaching ships in their sights. 
Unusually, Chinese aircraft last week breached the mid line of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial barrier for combat aircraft of both sides, although they have not flown over mainland Taiwan.
On Monday, China's foreign ministry said the line did not exist, provoking condemnation from Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu.
In Taipei on Tuesday, Wu called the line an important ""symbol"" for avoiding military clashes, and urged other countries to condemn China.
""We demand the international community strongly condemns China's words and actions and demand the Chinese government stops everything that it has been doing,"" he added.
China has been angered by stepped-up U.S. support for democratic Taiwan, including a visit to Taipei last week by U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach.

Taiwanese fighters have scrambled many times this year to intercept Chinese aircraft.

The Ho Chi Minh City court found 17 of the defendants guilty of terrorism and convicted three for illegal use of explosives, over an attack in the same city that police said was funded by an exiled anti-government group. 
The two-day trial was the latest in a series of high-profile cases in Vietnam that are being decided in the run-up to a five-yearly shakeup in January of the leadership of the ruling Communist Party. 
Those include the jailing of a man for terrorism in April over a bomb at a tax office and last week's sentencing to death of two bothers for killing three policemen during a clash over land rights. 
The defendants' lawyer, Nguyen Van Mieng, said all 20 had pleaded guilty and would be held under house arrest after they leave prison.
""The sentences given at the trial are too harsh,"" Mieng told Reuters.
Despite increasing openness and tolerance to social change, the party that has controlled Vietnam for nearly five decades tolerates little dissent and has recently stepped up a crackdown on its detractors. 
The Ministry of Public Security said ahead of this week's trial that the defendants had received money from an exiled organisation, Trieu Dai Viet, to buy explosives and detonators for ""terrorism activities to overthrow the state of Vietnam.""
The ministry said they detonated two bombs at a police station. Police said the explosions injured three people..
Canada-based Trieu Dai Viet, or Viet Dynasty, also had plans to bomb state targets elsewhere, according to police, which said the group's motto was ""fire all"", ""kill all"", ""destroy all"", ""steal all"".
Reuters could not reach Trieu Dai Viet for comment. 

The public security ministry said the group was founded by a Ngo Van Hoang Hung, who it says broke out of prison in 1982 and fled to Canada.

Once a farmer, it was the death of Mbambu's husband ten years ago that forced her to find a new way to support her six children in a city where the majority of people live in extreme poverty on less than $1.90 a day.
She sank her savings into a red motorbike, known locally as a ""boda"", and hit the road. 
Decades of unrest, including a civil war that ended in 2003 and an ongoing Islamist insurgency, has made violence against women commonplace in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, ranked one of the 10 most dangerous countries to be a woman by a  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation poll in 2018. 
According to the United Nations, documented cases of sexual violence in the east of the country rose 34% last year.
The novelty of a woman riding a motorbike taxi has won Mbambu loyal clients, but also saved her life.
""One time I was riding from the countryside when I was ambushed by bandits,"" Mbambu said.
""They were dressed in red blood-stained clothes and wanted to harm me, but when they noticed that I was a woman on a motorbike, they got very surprised and urged me to go on with my journey.""
Since launching her business, Mbambu has picked up a number of regulars, with many women preferring her services to take them to and from the market.

154,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China sharply expands mass labor program in Tibet,"By Cate Cadell
BEIJING (Reuters) - China is pushing growing numbers of Tibetan rural laborers off the land and into recently built military-style training centers where they are turned into factory workers, mirroring a program in the western Xinjiang region that rights groups have branded coercive labor.
Beijing has set quotas for the mass transfer of rural laborers within Tibet and to other parts of China, according to over a hundred state media reports, policy documents from government bureaus in Tibet and procurement requests released between 2016-2020 and reviewed by Reuters. The quota effort marks a rapid expansion of an initiative designed to provide loyal workers for Chinese industry.
A notice posted to the website of Tibet's regional government website last month said over half a million people were trained as part of the project in the first seven months of 2020 - around 15% of the region's population. Of this total, almost 50,000 have been transferred into jobs within Tibet, and several thousand have been sent to other parts of China. Many end up in low paid work, including textile manufacturing, construction and agriculture.
""This is now, in my opinion, the strongest, most clear and targeted attack on traditional Tibetan livelihoods that we have seen almost since the Cultural Revolution"" of 1966 to 1976, said Adrian Zenz, an independent Tibet and Xinjiang researcher, who compiled the core findings about the program. These are detailed in a report released this week by the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based institute that focuses on policy issues of strategic importance to the U.S. ""It's a coercive lifestyle change from nomadism and farming to wage labor.""
Reuters corroborated Zenz's findings and found additional policy documents, company reports, procurement filings and state media reports that describe the program.
In a statement to Reuters, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly denied the involvement of forced labor, and said China is a country with rule of law and that workers are voluntary and properly compensated.
""What these people with ulterior motives are calling 'forced labor' simply does not exist. We hope the international community will distinguish right from wrong, respect facts, and not be fooled by lies,"" it said.
Moving surplus rural labor into industry is a key part of China's drive to boost the economy and reduce poverty. But in areas like Xinjiang and Tibet, with large ethnic populations and a history of unrest, rights groups say the programs include an outsized emphasis on ideological training. And the government quotas and military-style management, they say, suggest the transfers have coercive elements.
China seized control of Tibet after Chinese troops entered the region in 1950, in what Beijing calls a ""peaceful liberation."" Tibet has since become one of the most restricted and sensitive areas in the country.
The Tibetan program is expanding as international pressure is growing over similar projects in Xinjiang, some of which have been linked to mass detention centers. A United Nations report has estimated that around one million people in Xinjiang, mostly ethnic Uighurs, were detained in camps and subjected to ideological education. China initially denied the existence of the camps, but has since said they are vocational and education centers, and that all the people have ""graduated.""
Reuters was unable to ascertain the conditions of the transferred Tibetan workers. Foreign journalists are not permitted to enter the region, and other foreign citizens are only permitted on government-approved tours.
In recent years, Xinjiang and Tibet have been the target of harsh policies in pursuit of what Chinese authorities call ""stability maintenance."" These policies are broadly aimed at quelling dissent, unrest or separatism and include restricting the travel of ethnic citizens to other parts of China and abroad, and tightening control over religious activities.
In August, President Xi Jinping said China will again step up efforts against separatism in Tibet, where ethnic Tibetans make up around 90% of the population, according to census data. Critics, spearheaded by Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, accuse the Chinese authorities of carrying out ""cultural genocide"" in the region. The 85-year-old Nobel Laureate has been based in Dharamsala, India, since he fled China in 1959 following a failed uprising against Chinese authorities.
ELIMINATE 'LAZY PEOPLE'
While there has been some evidence of military-style training and labor transfers in Tibet in the past, this new, enlarged program represents the first on a mass scale and the first to openly set quotas for transfers outside the region.
A key element, described in multiple regional policy documents, involves sending officials into villages and townships to gather data on rural laborers and conduct education activities, aimed at building loyalty.
State media described one such operation in villages near the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. Officials carried out over a thousand anti-separatism education sessions, according to the state media report, ""allowing the people of all ethnic groups to feel the care and concern of the Party Central Committee,"" referring to China's ruling Communist Party.
The report said the sessions included songs, dances and sketches in ""easy to understand language."" Such ""education"" work took place prior to the rollout of the wider transfers this year.
The model is similar to Xinjiang, and researchers say a key link between the two is the former Tibet Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, who took over the same post in Xinjiang in 2016 and spearheaded the development of Xinjiang's camp system. The Xinjiang government, where Chen remains Party boss, did not respond to a request for comment.
""In Tibet, he was doing a slightly lower level, under the radar, version of what was implemented in Xinjiang,"" said Allen Carlson, Associate Professor in Cornell University's Government Department.
Around 70% of Tibet's population is classified as rural, according to 2018 figures from China's National Bureau of Statistics. This includes a large proportion of subsistence farmers, posing a challenge for China's poverty alleviation program, which measures its success on levels of basic income. China has pledged to eradicate rural poverty in the country by the end of 2020.
""In order to cope with the increasing downward economic pressure on the employment income of rural workers, we will now increase the intensity of precision skills training ... and carry out organized and large-scale transfer of employment across provinces, regions and cities,"" said a working plan released by Tibet's Human Resources and Social Security Department in July. The plan included 2020 quotas for the program in different areas.
Some of the policy documents and state media reports reviewed by Reuters make reference to unspecified punishments for officials who fail to meet their quotas. One prefecture level implementation plan called for ""strict reward and punishment measures"" for officials.
As in Xinjiang, private intermediaries, such as agents and companies, that organize transfers can receive subsidies set at 500 yuan ($74) for each laborer moved out of the region and 300 yuan ($44) for those placed within Tibet, according to regional and prefecture level notices.
Officials have previously said that labor transfer programs in other parts of China are voluntary, and many of the Tibetan government documents also mention mechanisms to ensure laborers' rights, but they don't provide details. Advocates, rights groups and researchers say it's unlikely laborers are able to decline work placements, though they acknowledge that some may be voluntary.
""These recent announcements dramatically and dangerously expand these programs, including 'thought training' with the government's coordination, and represent a dangerous escalation,"" said Matteo Mecacci, president of U.S. based advocacy group, the International Campaign for Tibet.
The government documents reviewed by Reuters put a strong emphasis on ideological education to correct the ""thinking concepts"" of laborers. ""There is the assertion that minorities are low in discipline, that their minds must be changed, that they must be convinced to participate,"" said Zenz, the Tibet-Xinjiang researcher based in Minnesota.
One policy document, posted on the website of the Nagqu City government in Tibet's east in December 2018, reveals early goals for the plan and sheds light on the approach. It describes how officials visited villages to collect data on 57,800 laborers. Their aim was to tackle ""can't do, don't want to do and don't dare to do"" attitudes toward work, the document says. It calls for unspecified measures to ""effectively eliminate 'lazy people.'""
A report released in January by the Tibetan arm of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a high-profile advisory body to the government, describes internal discussions on strategies to tackle the ""mental poverty"" of rural laborers, including sending teams of officials into villages to carry out education and ""guide the masses to create a happy life with their hardworking hands.""
MILITARY DRILLS AND UNIFORMS
Rural workers who are moved into vocational training centers receive ideological education - what China calls ""military-style"" training - according to multiple Tibetan regional and district-level policy documents describing the program in late 2019 and 2020. The training emphasises strict discipline, and participants are required to perform military drills and dress in uniforms.
It is not clear what proportion of participants in the labor transfer program undergo such military-style training. But policy documents from Ngari, Xigatze and Shannan, three districts which account for around a third of Tibet's population, call for the ""vigorous promotion of military-style training."" Region-wide policy notices also make reference to this training method.
Small-scale versions of similar military-style training initiatives have existed in the region for over a decade, but construction of new facilities increased sharply in 2016, and recent policy documents call for more investment in such sites. A review of satellite imagery and documents relating to over a dozen facilities in different districts in Tibet shows that some are built near to or within existing vocational centers.
The policy documents describe a teaching program that combines skills education, legal education and ""gratitude education,"" designed to boost loyalty to the Party.
James Leibold, professor at Australia's La Trobe University who specializes in Tibet and Xinjiang, says there are different levels of military-style training, with some less restrictive than others, but that there is a focus on conformity.
""Tibetans are seen as lazy, backward, slow or dirty, and so what they want to do is to get them marching to the same beat... That's a big part of this type of military-style education.""
In eastern Tibet's Chamdo district, where some of the earliest military-style training programs emerged, state media images from 2016 show laborers lining up in drill formation in military fatigues. In images published by state media in July this year, waitresses in military clothing are seen training at a vocational facility in the same district. Pictures posted online from the ""Chamdo Golden Sunshine Vocational Training School"" show rows of basic white shed-like accommodation with blue roofs. In one image, banners hanging on the wall behind a row of graduates say the labor transfer project is overseen by the local Human Resources and Social Security Department.
The vocational skills learned by trainees include textiles, construction, agriculture and ethnic handicrafts. One vocational center describes elements of training including ""Mandarin language, legal training and political education."" A separate regional policy document says the goal is to ""gradually realize the transition from 'I must work' to 'I want to work.'""
Regional and prefecture level policy documents place an emphasis on training batches of workers for specific companies or projects. Rights groups say this on-demand approach increases the likelihood that the programs are coercive.
SUPPLY CHAIN
Workers transferred under the programs can be difficult to trace, particularly those sent to other parts of China. In similar mass transfers of Uighur people from Xinjiang, workers were discovered in the supply chains of 83 global brands, according to a report released by the The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).
Researchers and rights groups say transfers from these regions pose a challenge because without access they can't assess whether the practice constitutes forced labor, and transferred workers often work alongside non-transferred counterparts.
Tibetan state media reports in July say that in 2020 some of the workers transferred outside of Tibet were sent to construction projects in Qinghai and Sichuan. Others transferred within Tibet were trained in textiles, security and agricultural production work.
Regional Tibetan government policy notices and prefecture implementation plans provide local government offices with quotas for 2020, including for Tibetan workers sent to other parts of China. Larger districts are expected to supply more workers to other areas of the country - 1,000 from the Tibetan capital Lhasa, 1,400 from Xigaze, and 800 from Shannan.
Reuters reviewed policy notices put out by Tibet and a dozen other provinces that have accepted Tibetan laborers. These documents reveal that workers are often moved in groups and stay in collective accommodation.

Local government documents inside Tibet and in three other provinces say workers remain in centralised accommodation after they are transferred, separated from other workers and under supervision. One state media document, describing a transfer within the region, referred to it as a ""point to point 'nanny' service.""
The Tibetan Human Resources and Social Security Department noted in July that people are grouped into teams of 10 to 30. They travel with team leaders and are managed by ""employment liaison services."" The department said the groups are tightly managed, especially when moving outside Tibet, where the liaison officers are responsible for carrying out ""further education activities and reducing homesickness complexes."" It said the government is responsible for caring for ""left-behind women, children and the elderly.""

KABUL/JALALABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Heavily pregnant Taj Bibi prays for her fourth husband as the Afghan soldier sets off to battle the Taliban, hoping his fate won't be the same as that of his three brothers, her first three husbands, all killed fighting the militants.
Clashes between Afghan government forces and Taliban insurgents have not died down despite peace talks in Qatar that have raised hopes for an end to Afghanistan's seemingly endless cycle of war.
At least 60 members of the Afghan security forces were killed in the past week across the country.
Bibi, watching her husband, Aminullah, set off for a three-month stint on the front line, has a simple plea: she hopes the men in power don't make her a widow for a fourth time.
""I can't afford to see my five children being orphaned again,"" said Bibi, 33, who lives in the Sadeqabad area of mountainous Kunar province in eastern Afghanistan.
Bibi was 18 when she got married for the first time, to Aminullah's oldest brother, who was a soldier.
Life was good, Bibi says, until her husband was killed in a battle with the Taliban. Within months, she married her his younger brother, also a soldier.
It is common in ethnic Pashtun society for widows to marry their brothers-in-law because of a belief that a widow should not marry outside the family.
But even before she came to terms with her new life, a pregnant Bibi had to identify the bloody body of her second husband, who was killed defending a check-point from a Taliban attack.
'BLAME MYSELF'
After 90 days of mourning, she agreed to her father-in-law's request that she marry his third son, a police officer. He was killed in a clash with the Taliban in 2017.
That same year, Bibi married Aminullah, the fourth brother, who accepted his three-time widowed sister-in-law as his wife along with her children.
""Sometimes I blame the Taliban, sometimes I blame the Afghan government, sometimes I blame the foreign forces but mostly I blame myself for all this pain,"" Bibi told Reuters over the telephone.
Bibi is a devout Muslim and prays five times a day.
""Islam teaches us not to kill anyone, but here in our land we just kill anyone and everyone,"" she said.
""I don't know if Allah understands my pain and loss.""
She says she begs Aminullah to quit the army but he promises he'll be back from his tours of duty. She also prays that peace will save him.
""My life depends on seeing my husband alive,"" she said.
Bibi spends much of her time sewing clothes for her children, and cares for them and an extended family of 15 people on Aminullah's monthly income of $300, and pension allowances for her dead husbands.
She said people die once but after losing three husbands, she felt like she'd already died three times.

""Maybe I'm just unlucky.""

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's ruling Labour Party has lost some support since July as the coronavirus resurged in Auckland, but it is still set to win the upcoming general election on Oct 17 comfortably, an opinion poll showed on Tuesday.
The 1News-Colmar Brunton poll showed support for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's party, which is seeking a second term in office, at 48%, down 5 percentage points since the last poll in late July.
The opposition National party also lost 1 percentage point taking it to 31%, under newly elected leader Judith Collins.
The results mean Labour would get 62 seats, and can govern alone without any coalition.
Small parties like the Green Party got 6% support while the ACT New Zealand surprised with 7% support. But populist New Zealand First Party, a kingmaker in the last election, dropped to 2%, which means it would not get into parliament if it does not win an electorate seat.
All recent polls have pointed to a comfortable victory for Ardern, who has won global praise for her leadership during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Ardern and Collins will face each other in the first live TV debate for the election later on Tuesday.
Ardern has called it a 'COVID election' and focused her campaign on highlighting the government's success is tackling the health and economic challenges thrown up by the pandemic.
The 40-year-old, who became the world's youngest female leader after unexpectedly winning power in 2017, holds huge appeal domestically and globally where she has garnered praise for her views on issues such as women’s rights, climate change and diversity.
Her response to last year's terror attack by a white supremacist, a fatal volcanic eruption and the recent COVID-19 have helped boost her party's standing.
Ardern's stardom, however, masks some of the domestic issues that the ruling coalition has failed to tackle including a shortage of affordable housing, child poverty, and tax reforms.

Collins, popularly known as 'Crusher Collins', will look to highlight these shortcomings. The 61-year-old, who became National Party's third leader this year, has promised massive infrastructure spending, reduced taxes and a boost to the economy.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong has no legal basis to demand that any particular rights be extended to 12 Hong Kong people detained in China as they tried to flee by boat and they will have to face the law there, the city's chief executive said on Tuesday.
The 12 were arrested on Aug. 23 for illegal entry into mainland Chinese waters after setting off from Hong Kong in a boat bound for self-ruled Taiwan following a crackdown on pro-democracy activists in the former British colony.
Their failed bid to flee to Taiwan has highlighted the fears that many people feel in semi-autonomous Hong Kong about what they see as China's determination to end any push for greater democracy in the financial hub.
Chinese police have said the 12 were suspected of illegal border crossing. China's foreign ministry has called them ""separatists.""
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam was asked at her weekly news conference if she could ensure that the 12 would be afforded human rights safeguards such as presumption of innocence, fair trial and legal representation.
""We do not have the legal basis to do the things that you want us to do,"" she said.
Mainland authorities have said the legitimate rights of the 12 were being protected according to the law.
China's legal system is controlled by and loyal to the ruling Communist Party, meaning courts do not usually challenge party or government accusations.
Lam said the 12 would have to face the law in mainland China before they could return to Hong Kong to face justice for any crimes committed at home.
All 12 were suspected of crimes in Hong Kong related to anti-government protests that erupted last year. Ten had been charged, released on bail and not allowed to leave the city. 
They are being detained in the neighbouring city of Shenzhen.
Their fate is being closely watched in Hong Kong amid apprehension about Beijing's greater control over the city especially since it imposed a national security law in June.
Beijing and Hong Kong government say the law is aimed at tackling subversion, separatism, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.
Critics say it undermines the special status the city was guaranteed when Britain handed it over to China under ""one country, two systems"" formula in 1997.

Supporters of the law say it will bring stability and safeguard prosperity after a year of unrest.

158,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 01:42AM ET</span>",Australia attempts to rescue hundreds of stranded pilot whales,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Rescuers were trying to refloat hundreds of whales stranded on a sandbar off the remote west coast of the Australian island of Tasmania on Tuesday, hoping to end one of the country's worst beaching events.
Government scientists estimated about 90 of around 270 pilot whales trapped in shallow water had died since the stranding was reported a day earlier. 
Aerial footage showed large numbers of the animals largely prone on a wide sandbar at Macquarie Harbour, about 200 kms (120 miles) northwest of the state capital Hobart, while others floundered in slightly deeper water. 
""We've got animals that are semi-buoyant so it probably won't take too much to refloat those animals closer to the deeper water, and will involve just a bit of grunt from specialised crew in the water,"" Kris Carlyon, a wildlife biologist with the state government, told local media.
Pilot whales are a species of oceanic dolphin that grow to 7 metres (23 ft) long and can weigh up to 3 tonnes. Drawing them back out to sea is a labour intensive process that can include physically pushing the animals or using specialised tarpaulins and pontoons to drag them to deeper water. Rescuers try to keep the whales upright to avoid disorientation.
Around 40 government scientists, 20 police officers, and local fish farmers and volunteers were involved in the rescue attempt, which experts said was the hardest they had encountered.
While the wet, cool conditions were beneficial for the whales, the rough waters and remote location were more challenging for their rescuers. 
""It's pretty ugly out there for people on the ground, but as far as the whales go it's ideal,"" Carlyon said. ""If the conditions stay the same they can survive quite a few days.""

Scientists do not know why whales, which travel together in pods, sometimes beach themselves but they are known to follow a leader, as well as gather around an injured or distressed whale.

160,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 06:10PM ET</span>",Palestinians arrest supporters of Abbas rival based in UAE,"RAMALLAH, West Bank/GAZA (Reuters) - Palestinian security forces arrested over half a dozen supporters of an exiled Palestinian politician who some have accused of involvement in the United Arab Emirates deal to forge ties with Israel, a spokesman for his faction said.
Mohammed Dahlan has lived in the UAE since being driven out of the Israeli-occupied West Bank in 2011 after a bitter row with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his political party Fatah, of which Dahlan is a member. 
The Gulf Arab country's deal to establish diplomatic relations with Israel has angered Palestinians and stirred widespread speculation that Dahlan played a role. 
Dahlan's faction has criticised Arab countries forming relations with Israel before its conflict with the Palestinians is resolved, though he has not outright denied involvement. 
On Monday, seven members of Dahlan's faction were arrested by security forces from Abbas's Palestinian Authority (PA), which has limited self-rule in the West Bank, according to Dahlan faction spokesman Imad Mohsen, who called the arrests ""politically motivated"".
The arrests were carried out in the West Bank and included Haytham al-Halabi and Salim Abu Safia, both senior members of Dahlan's faction, a statement from the group said. 
In a statement, the Palestinian security forces said they had detained Halabi from a village near the West Bank city of Nablus as part of ""a continuation of efforts to impose security and order"".
The statement did not mention any other arrests. 
The PA's interior ministry declined comment. 
A former Gaza security chief, Dahlan has long been floated as a potential successor to Abbas. He has cultivated close ties with UAE leaders since his exile. 
The UAE and fellow Gulf Arab state Bahrain signed normalisation agreements with Israel at the White House last week in a ceremony hosted by U.S. President Donald Trump.
The deals were the first such accommodations between Arab countries and Israel in more than 20 years, and were forged partly through shared fears of Iran. 

Palestinians have called the moves a betrayal, fearing they would weaken a longstanding pan-Arab position that calls for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory and acceptance of a Palestinian state in return for normal relations with Israel.

161,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 05:41PM ET</span>",Taiwan military says it has right to counterattack amid China threats,"By Yimou Lee
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan said on Monday its armed forces have the right to self-defence and counterattack amid ""harassment and threats"", in an apparent warning to China, which last week sent numerous jets across the mid-line of the sensitive Taiwan Strait.
Tensions have sharply spiked in recent months between Taipei and Beijing, which claims democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory, to be taken by force if needed.
Chinese aircraft crossed the mid-line to enter the island's air defence identification zone on Friday and Saturday, prompting Taiwan to scramble jets to intercept them, and President Tsai Ing-wen to call China a threat to the region.
Taiwan's defence ministry said it had ""clearly defined"" procedures for a first response amid ""high frequency of harassment and threats from the enemy's warships and aircraft this year"".
It said Taiwan had the right to ""self-defence and to counterattack"" and followed the guideline of ""no escalation of conflict and no triggering incidents"".
Taiwan would not provoke, but it was also ""not afraid of the enemy"", it added.
MID-LINE ""DOES NOT EXIST""
Taiwanese and Chinese combat aircraft normally observe the mid-line of the Taiwan Strait and do not cross it, although there is no official agreement between Taipei and Beijing on doing so, and the rule is observed unofficially.
""Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters in Beijing. ""The so-called mid-line of the Strait does not exist."" 
Since 2016 Taiwan has reported only five Chinese incursions across the line, including the two last week.
Late on Monday, Taiwan's Defence Ministry reported two Chinese anti-submarine aircraft had flown into Taiwan's air defence identification zone - but not over the mid-line - to the island's southwest, and were warned away by Taiwanese fighters.
The drills came as Beijing expressed anger at the visit of a senior U.S. official to Taipei. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday accused Beijing of bluster when asked about the Chinese activity.
A senior Trump administration official on Monday said the Chinese aircraft movements were ""consistent with past Chinese behavior"" during heightened tensions and appeared more a reaction to Taiwan domestic politics. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington did not believe China was seeking to escalate into a military confrontation.
On Monday, the official China Daily newspaper said the United States was trying to use Taiwan to contain China but nobody should underestimate its determination to assert its sovereignty over the island.
""The U.S. administration should not be blinkered in its desperation to contain the peaceful rise of China and indulge in the U.S. addiction to its hegemony,"" it said in an editorial.
China has been angered by stepped-up U.S. support for Taiwan, including two visits by top officials, one in August by Health Secretary Alex Azar and the other last week by Keith Krach, undersecretary of state for economic affairs.

The United States, which has no diplomatic ties with the island but is its strongest backer, also plans new arms sales to Taiwan.

162,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>",UK Labour leader Starmer urges voters to 'take another look' at his party,"LONDON (Reuters) - British opposition leader Keir Starmer will appeal on Tuesday to former supporters of his Labour Party to return to the fold with the message that it is now under ""new leadership"" and shares their patriotic values.
Labour suffered heavy losses at last year's election, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives won over many voters in the party's heartlands with a promise to ""get Brexit done"" and by tapping discontent with ex-leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Starmer, elected Labour leader in April, wants to win back so-called 'Red Wall' seats in northern and central England taken by the Conservatives, but also faces a tough struggle to convince voters in Scotland to return to the party.
Addressing the party's virtual conference from the northern English town of Doncaster, Starmer will tell Labour members: ""To those people in Doncaster and Deeside, in Glasgow and Grimsby, in Stoke and in Stevenage to those who have turned away from Labour, I say this: we hear you.""
""I ask you: take another look at Labour. We're under new leadership. We love this country as you do,"" the 58-year-old former chief prosecutor will say, according to excerpts from his speech.
Starmer will also set out his vision for Britain, saying a Labour government would properly fund public services, create a world-class education system, invest in skills and become ""an active force for good in the world"" by tackling climate change.
With an election still nearly four years away, Starmer is trying to navigate Labour's way in winning back former supporters while holding the Conservative government to account without being seen as unnecessarily critical at a time when the country is struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.
Labour has caught up with the Conservatives for the first time since Johnson became prime minister in July last year, according to a YouGov opinion poll published last Friday that put both parties on 40%.

But the Conservatives, who have an 80-seat parliamentary majority, are hoping that, by the time of the next election, they will have recovered strongly from the current criticism of their handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday slapped new sanctions on Iran's defense ministry and others involved in its nuclear and weapons program to support the U.S. assertion that all U.N. sanctions against Tehran are now restored, which key European allies as well as Russia and China reject.
Iran said the new U.S. sanctions, which targeted 27 Iranian entities and people in the nuclear, missile and conventional arms sectors, would have no effect and accused the United States of seeking publicity.
The latest sanctions on the oil-exporting nation include a new executive order signed by President Donald Trump targeting those who buy or sell Iran conventional arms that was previously reported by Reuters. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters Washington had put new sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro under the order, accusing Iran and Venezuela of having worked ""to flout the U.N. arms embargo"" for nearly two years.
Under the same order, the United States also imposed penalties on Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics, as well as its Defense Industries Organization and its director, Mehrdad Akhlaghi-Ketabchi.
Others targeted under different programs include senior Atomic Energy Organization of Iran officials as well as people associated with its liquid propellant ballistic missile organization, Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group.
The impetus for the U.S. action is the impending expiry of a U.N. arms embargo on Iran and an effort to warn foreign actors that they will face U.S. sanctions if they buy or sell arms to Iran. U.S. entities are already barred from such trade.
Under the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran struck with six major powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - the U.N. conventional arms embargo is to set to expire on Oct. 18, shortly before the Nov. 3 U.S. election.
""No matter who you are, if you violate the U.N. arms embargo on Iran, you risk sanctions,"" Pompeo told a news conference with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Robert O'Brien, the national security adviser.
The United States, which abandoned the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018 and subsequently restored its own bilateral sanctions, says it triggered a ""snap back,"" or resumption, of virtually all U.N. sanctions on Iran, including the arms embargo, on Saturday.
The other parties to the nuclear deal and most U.N. Security Council members have said the U.S. move has no legal effect.
""NOTHING NEW"" 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif brushed aside the announcement as ""nothing new.""
""The United States has exerted all the pressure it could on Iran. It had hoped that these sanctions will bring our people into their knee. It did not,"" Zarif, speaking from Tehran, told a virtual meeting of the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations.
Zarif also struck a conciliatory note by repeating that Tehran is ready to exchange prisoners with Washington. 
Elizabeth Rosenberg, a sanctions expert at the Center for a New American Security, said that Monday's action did not significantly “move the needle,” either in raising pressure on Iran or in punishing those who deal with it. 
""The United States has already significantly targeted Iran, and this new action doesn't ... cause much more significant pain,"" she said.
A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, on Sunday told Reuters Iran may have enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by the end of the year and that Tehran has resumed long-range missile cooperation with nuclear-armed North Korea. He did not provide evidence for either assertion.
It was not clear whether the official meant Iran may have sufficient low-enriched uranium (LEU) for a bomb if it were further purified.
Tehran has gradually breached its central limits in the two years since Trump abandoned the nuclear deal, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says, including on its LEU stockpile and the level of purity to which it was allowed to enrich uranium.
Asked about the U.S. official's comment, Zarif called his reasoning flawed and denied Iran has any intention of building a bomb because atomic weapons would not make Iran more secure.
""Now we have about 3,000 kg which based on these analysis is enough for three bombs already. So we do not need to wait until the end of the year,"" he said. ""But we do not need to build a bomb."" 

The IAEA has said Iran is still enriching uranium only up to 4.5%, beyond the 3.67% purity limit set by the nuclear deal but well below the 20% it achieved before the 2015 agreement, let alone the roughly 90% purity that is considered weapons-grade.

LONGUEUIL, Quebec (Reuters) - Canadian police on Monday searched an apartment in a Montreal suburb linked to the woman arrested for sending a ricin-filled envelope to the White House and to five other addresses in Texas, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said.
U.S. authorities arrested a woman at the U.S.-Canada border near Buffalo, New York, on Sunday on suspicion that she sent the deadly poison by mail, addressed to the White House. The woman has joint Canadian and French citizenship, two sources said on Monday.
She will appear on Tuesday at 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) in Buffalo before Judge H. Kenneth Schroeder, Jr., a spokeswoman for the federal court in the Western District of New York said. 
""We believe a total of six letters were sent, one to the White House and five to Texas,"" RCMP officer Charles Poirier said outside the modern brown and grey building where the search was taking place. ""We can't confirm that she lived in (the apartment), but it is connected to her."" 
Poirier could not say where in Texas the envelopes were mailed, but the police department in Mission, Texas, received a suspicious letter within the last week, Art Flores, a spokesman for the department, said. The department did not open the envelope and turned it over to the FBI, he said.
Flores also said the Mission police had arrested the woman now believed to be held in Buffalo in early 2019, but said he did not have records related to the arrest and referred further inquiries to the FBI.
The FBI is investigating several suspected ricin letters sent to law enforcement and detention facilities in South Texas, a U.S. law enforcement source told Reuters.
So far they have not found any link to political or terrorist groups, but the investigation is ongoing, the source said.
The RCMP's special Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosives team is leading the operation, the RCMP said.
On Saturday, the RCMP confirmed the White House letter had apparently been sent from Canada and said the FBI had requested assistance.
The envelope was intercepted at a government mail center before it arrived at the White House. 

Ricin is found naturally in castor beans but it takes a deliberate act to convert it into a biological weapon. Ricin can cause death within 36 to 72 hours from exposure to an amount as small as a pinhead. No known antidote exists.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's largest unions lead protests on Monday against the social and economic policies of President Ivan Duque, seeking to revive mass demonstrations after recent incidents of police brutality in which 13 people died and hundreds were injured.
Protesters rode to the labor ministry on bicycles, motorcycles and in cars decorated with green balloons and signs. The caravan was an attempt by demonstrators to comply with coronavirus restrictions which mandate face masks and ban large crowds.
""I'm here to demand respect for life, respect of the rights of workers, an end to worsening police violence against protesters,"" said 38-year-old lawyer Diana Amezquita, as she waved a white flag outside the ministry.
The death this month of a man detained and repeatedly stun-gunned by police lead to several nights of protests in the capital Bogota and satellite city Soacha. The deaths and injuries during the demonstrations stoked anger among some Colombians already distraught at mass murders and assassinations of human right activists.
On Monday, Bogota's mayor Claudia Lopez said public transport would shut at 8 p.m. and encouraged people to return home as early as possible.
Union and student leaders hope to rejuvenate widespread protests which took place in November and December last year. Isolated looting associated with the protests lead to the first curfew declarations in a generation in Bogota and Cali, but demonstrations fizzled ahead of the Christmas holidays.
Earlier this year, the coronavirus pandemic stymied supporters of the protests, as more than 765,000 Colombians were infected and more than 24,000 died. The country gradually loosened lockdown measures between March and the end of August.
The economy took a big hit from the lockdown. Urban unemployment surged to nearly 25% and the government predicts economic contraction of 5.5% this year. 
The downturn could galvanize protesters who believe potential pension and tax reforms will hurt workers. The government has not yet announced specific reform plans.

Lawyers for Jacob Gardner, 38, had expected him to return to Omaha after a grand jury returned a four-count indictment on Sept. 15. The development was unexpected after prosecutors initially decided against bringing charges, Stu Dornan, one of Gardner's attorneys, said on Sunday.
""He was really shook up, because the grand jury indictment was a shock to him, it was a shock to us and it was a shock to many people,” Dornan told reporters.
Police in Hillsboro, Oregon, a suburb just west of Portland, confirmed in a statement that Gardner's body was found on Sunday outside a medical clinic, but did not immediately classify it as a suicide. 
Gardner's lawyers said he fled to Northern California and later Oregon on their advice due to death threats on social media after Douglas County District Attorney Don Kleine declined to charge him in the death of 22-year-old James Scurlock. 
Grainy video taken outside Gardner's bar shows two men in an altercation during sometimes violent protests on the night of May 30 that swept through Omaha and other U.S. cities following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
An investigation into Scurlock's death led to a grand jury charging Gardner with manslaughter, use of a deadly weapon, attempted assault and terroristic threats.
Special prosecutor Frederick Franklin told reporters much of the evidence that led to the indictment came from Gardner's cellphone, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) messages and video from inside the bar.
Gardner's attorneys, noting that he was an Iraq war veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, said they were confident he would have been acquitted.

Poland has been embroiled in a long-running row with the European Union about judicial reforms which critics say increase political control over the courts. In July, a Dutch court refused to extradite a suspect in a drugs case to Poland citing doubts about the independence of judges there.
On Monday, the Warsaw District Court, accepting a request from the prosecutor, refused to extradite the couple who had fled to Poland from the Netherlands with their autistic son, who had been taken into care by the authorities. 
The couple had been subject to a European Arrest Warrant, which usually ensures transfers of EU citizens, if requested, throughout the bloc, although there are some limited exceptions.
""The court paid a lot of attention ... to the issues of the independence of the Dutch judiciary and the independence of judges in the Netherlands,"" Deputy Justice Minister Michal Wojcik told Reuters.
""... the Dutch system is disproportionately politicised in relation to the Polish system ... in the Netherlands, politicians play a very strong role in the process of judicial appointments,"" he said.
The Dutch Justice Ministry could not immediately be reached for comment.
Polish state news agency PAP reported that the judge also noted that in the Netherlands euthanasia was legal after the age of 12, which could pose a threat to the boy's life.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - A man has been arrested in northern India after slashing his pregnant wife's stomach with a sickle, leaving her critically ill and causing the death of their unborn baby boy, police and her relatives said.
The woman was in intensive care in a hospital in the capital, New Delhi, said police in Budaun, Uttar Pradesh state, following Saturday's attack.
Her brother said the attack took place because the husband wanted to know the baby's gender. The couple already had five daughters.
""He attacked her with a sickle and ripped her stomach saying that he wanted to check the gender of the unborn child,"" the woman's brother, Golu Singh, told the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation.
Police said the baby was stillborn late on Sunday and a man had been remanded in custody.
Daughters are often seen as a burden in India, with families having to pay dowries when they marry, while sons are prized as breadwinners who inherit property and continue the family name.
Abortions of female fetuses have been banned in India, where the preference for boys has led to a dwindling number of girls.
According to a government survey released in July, India's gender ratio, or the number of females per 1,000 males, was 896 between 2015 and 2017, down from 898 in 2014-2016 and 900 in 2013-2015.
Indian law bans doctors and health workers from sharing an unborn child's sex with the parents, or carrying out tests to determine the child's gender, and only registered medical practitioners are allowed to perform abortions.

Washington has long demanded that Iran release U.S. citizens including Iranian-American father and son Baquer and Siamak Namazi, who it says are political prisoners.
Tehran denies it holds people for political reasons and has accused many of the foreigners in its jails of espionage. It says Iranians detained in the U.S., mostly for breaking sanctions, are being unjustly held.
""There are Iranians in U.S. prisons who are there only because they refuse to betray their country (Iran). We are prepared to exchange all of them and all those who have been kept in jail,"" Zarif said.
""I repeat, we can exchange all prisoners. Period.""
The two sides have done two prisoner exchanges despite a deterioration in relations in 2018 when U.S. President Donald Trump exited Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers and re-imposed sanctions on Tehran that have crippled its economy.
Washington piled more pressure on Iran at the weekend when it said it had triggered a snapback of U.N. sanctions and slapped new sanctions on Iranian officials on Monday.
Navy veteran Michael White, detained since 2018, returned home in June in return for the United States allowing an Iranian-American physician Majid Taheri to visit Iran. White said he contracted COVID-19 while in detention.

In December 2018, Washington and Tehran worked on a prisoner exchange in which Iran freed U.S. citizen Xiyue Wang, who had been held for three years on spying charges, and the United States freed Iranian Massoud Soleimani, who faced charges of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers failed to agree sanctions against Belarusian officials on Monday, despite an appeal by the country's main opposition leader.
After a sixth straight weekend of huge protests against President Alexander Lukashenko, opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya travelled to Brussels to try to convince the EU to follow through on a sanctions threat it announced last month.
So far the bloc has yet to approve a list of some 40 Belarusian officials to be hit with travel bans and asset freezes. Cyprus has been seen as blocking approval by tying the Belarus measures to unrelated sanctions it wants on Turkey in a gas exploration dispute.
""Although there is a clear will to adopt the sanctions, the required unanimity was not reached,"" the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell, who chaired the meeting of foreign ministers, told reporters, referring to EU rules that all 27 states must agree.
Approval is still possible by EU leaders at a summit on Thursday and Borrell said that by the next time foreign ministers meet on Oct. 12, the sanctions would be agreed. But he also acknowledged the paralysis was damaging for the EU's image.
""If we are not able to (approve Belarus sanctions), then our credibility is at stake,"" Borrell told a news conference.
Back in Minsk, a city court rejected a legal appeal from the defence team of Tsikhanouskaya's political ally, Maria Kolesnikova, against her detention. 
Kolesnikova was jailed after ripping up her passport to prevent the Belarusian authorities from forcibly expelling her to Ukraine. She was charged last week with calling for ""actions aimed at undermining Belarusian national security"".
About a hundred supporters gathered in and around the courthouse. Kolesnikova was not in court in person but when she appeared on a video screen people inside began to applaud.
""BE BRAVE""
Though the EU announce plans for the sanctions last month, enacting them requires support from all 27 member states. Cyprus wants a deal first on measures in its dispute against Turkey.
""Our reaction to any kind of violation of our core, basic values and principles cannot be a la carte. It needs to be consistent,"" Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulides said.
The presidents of Lithuania, Poland and Romania said on Monday they will ask EU leaders at this week's summit to offer an economic support package for Belarus if it holds a democratic election. That would include a favourable trade regime with the EU, visa-free travel and support as a candidate for the World Trade Organization.
""EU leaders have reasons not to push sanctions but I asked them to be more brave,"" Tsikhanouskaya, who fled to Lithuania after the election, told reporters after meeting foreign ministers.

""Sanctions are important in our fight because it's part of pressure that could force the so-called authorities to start dialogue with us in the opposition council.""

They and three other soldiers were arrested after a video surfaced on social media in July 2018 showing uniformed men levelling rifles and firing at the victims, one of whom had a baby strapped to her back. 
The video was one of several to emerge in recent years of alleged atrocities by Cameroonian forces during operations against Islamist Boko Haram militants in the north and Anglophone separatists in the west. 
The trial started in January and has been conducted behind closed doors. On Monday, the court found three of the soldiers guilty of murder, while their commander Etienne Fabassou was found guilty of complicity in murder, according to his lawyer Sylvestre Mbeng.
All four were given ten years. 
Another soldier received a two-year sentence for violating orders, while two others were found not guilty on all counts and released, Mbeng told Reuters.
Under Cameroonian law, some of the defendants could have faced the death penalty, although Cameroon has not executed anyone since 1997. 
Mbeng said Fabassou would likely appeal the verdict as witnesses gave contradictory accounts of whether he gave the order to shoot.
Government and army officials initially dismissed the video as ""fake news"".
But the soldiers' eventual arrest and prosecution were welcomed by activists, including Amnesty International, who accuse government soldiers of repeatedly engaging in torture and extra-judicial killings in the far north. 
The government denies systematic abuses.
""All victims of human rights violations perpetrated by Cameroonian security forces in the fight against Boko Haram deserve fair justice granted by ordinary courts,"" said Amnesty's regional director Samira Daoud in response to the ruling.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan's main opposition Islamist party said on Monday it will run in its November parliamentary election to prevent a packing of the assembly with pro-government deputies and advance demands for democratic reform and a crackdown on corruption.
But the Islamists, who are affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and boycotted elections for a decade until 2016, warned they could reconsider its approach if its candidates came under state pressure to drop out.
""We call on the government to lift its ...security grip over these elections in all its aspects,"" said Murad al Adailah, general secretary of the Islamic Action Front, the political arm of Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood.
He said any repeat of irregularities that had marred previous elections would stoke public discontent as Jordan grapples with its worst economic crisis in many years, with unemployment and poverty aggravated by the COVID-19 outbreak.
""Meddling in these elections is playing with security and stability of the country...In such conditions, it would create a social explosion,"" Adailah said. ""We don't accept any pressure from anyone, or a diktat as to whom we nominate or don't.""
Analysts say electoral laws that favour tribal areas rather than cities, where Islamists enjoy most support, mean they are unlikely to dominate the vote, but they could still shake up Jordan’s sclerotic political scene.
The Islamists' comeback in the 2016 election, when they gained 16 of parliament's 130 seats as part of a broad civic alliance, ended a decade of boycott that had reduced voting to nominal contests between tribal leaders, establishment figures and independent businessmen.
Adailah said an Islamist voice was needed in parliament to help expose rampant corruption and stand up to tough laws restricting public freedoms as well as oppose any normalisation deals with Israel, with which Jordan has a peace treaty.
Jordan came close to banning the Brotherhood in recent years in what the Islamists said was a settling of scores over their instigation of protests seeking democratic reforms that would limit the powers of pro-Western King Abdullah.

Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was speaking in a virtual address to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
Iran's hardline judiciary said last week that Afkari, 27, a national champion Greco-Roman wrestler, was executed for murder. But his family and rights groups said he was tortured into making a false confession and his attorney said there was no proof of his guilt. 
""We have an independent judiciary and the government is not involved in the decision-making of the judiciary...This gentleman ... was executed not because of participation in the demonstrations but because of a murder,"" Zarif said.
""Many people participate in demonstrations (in Iran) and none of them are executed (for involvement in them)."" 
Iranian state media reported Afkari's execution on Sept. 12, saying Afkari had been convicted of stabbing a security guard to death during anti-government protests in 2018.
U.S. President Donald Trump had called on the Islamic Republic not to execute Afkari.
The European Union condemned Afkari's execution, calling it cruel and inhumane punishment, while U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called it ""an outrageous assault on human dignity, even by the despicable standards of this regime"".

177,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",Explainer: Democratic 'court packing' would prompt a gloves-off political fight,"By Andrew Chung
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The vow by Republican President Donald Trump and the Republicans to quickly fill U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat despite a looming election has revived talk among some Democrats of expanding the number of justices on the court. 
These Democrats, along with progressive activists, say all options must be considered to counter what would become an entrenched 6-3 conservative majority that could threaten access to healthcare, abortion, and civil rights. 
A plan to expand the court would likely lead to a bare-knuckles political fight with unpredictable consequences for both parties. Here are a few things to consider about ""court packing."" 
SIZE OF THE COURT 
The number of justices on the high court has remained at nine since 1869, but Congress has the power to change the size of the bench and did so several times before that. 
LAST PACKING PLAN FAILED
In 1937, President Franklin Roosevelt, facing a court that repeatedly struck down his New Deal legislation, proposed adding up to six justices, one for each member of the court over the age of 70. The plan faced considerable opposition, including in Roosevelt's own Democratic party, and was never enacted.
ABOLISHING THE FILIBUSTER
It is not clear Democrats would pursue a court packing plan. Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer told fellow Democrats on Saturday that ""nothing is off the table for next year"" if Republicans move forward with Trump's nominee. 
But expanding the court would require Democrats to control Congress and the White House. They would need to ditch a longstanding procedural rule in the Senate requiring 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, a tactic frequently used by the minority party to hold up legislation. 
DIVIDED DEMOCRATS
Democratic Senator Ed Markey wrote on Twitter on Friday that if Republicans seat a new justice during an election year, after refusing to give former President Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland a hearing in 2016, ""when Democrats control the Senate in the next Congress, we must abolish the filibuster and expand the Supreme Court.""
The party's presidential nominee Joe Biden has opposed the idea in the past. ""I'm not prepared to go on and try to pack the court, because we'll live to rue that day,"" he told the Iowa Starting Line in 2019. His running mate, Kamala Harris, however, told Politico last year that she was open to court packing. 
THE COURT'S LEGITIMACY
In an era of hyper partisanship, the high court's legitimacy has been increasingly called into question, particularly since the fight over Garland's nomination. Packing the court could prompt future Republicans to further expand the institution and could strengthen the view that the court is purely partisan and renders decisions based on politics rather than the law.
OTHER OPTIONS

Besides packing the court, activist groups and Democrats have broached the idea of imposing term limits for justices. This would likely require a constitutional amendment, though some scholars have proposed ways to accomplish term limits by statute.

Index has been the largest media organisation in Hungary that is critical of the government, and almost its entire staff resigned over what they called an ""open attempt to exert pressure"" on the site after the owner sacked their editor-in-chief.
The move raised concerns that Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government was intensifying efforts to muzzle critical voices. The government has denied what they called ""untrue accusations"".
Economia, whose titles include financial daily Hospodarske Noviny and weekly magazine Respekt, is one of the largest Czech publishing houses and has been owned by Czech businessman and investor Zdenek Bakala for over a decade.
""Telex's commitment to delivering outstanding journalism, particularly at a time when it is most needed, resonated strongly with us,"" chair of the board at Economia, Zuzana Reznickova said in a statement.
""In a spirit of solidarity, the Board and owner of the media house have decided to support the Telex project with a donation in the amount of EUR 200,000 to the early costs of launching the medium.""
The former journalists of Index have launched a campaign to collect subscriptions and donations for Telex and more than 32,000 people have already contributed. It is not clear yet when the new site will be launched.
Marton Karpati, managing director of Telex, confirmed they held talks with Economia.
""They signaled their intention to help us with a donation, and we are open to this,"" Karpati said, adding the details of the deal still needed to be worked out.
He said Economia would not get a stake in Telex in exchange for the support.

Negotiating teams representing the Taliban and the Afghan government have been meeting in the Qatari capital since talks started on Sept. 12. But little headway has been made, particularly on a ceasefire, which many international capitals have called for but which the insurgent group has rejected.
Sunday night's bloodiest clashes were in the central province of Uruzgan, where 24 members of the Afghan security forces were killed when Taliban fighters attacked security checkpoints, Deputy Governor of the province Sayed Mohammad Sadat said.
Clashes and casualties were also reported in the provinces of Takhar, Helmand, Kapisa, Balkh, Maidan Wardak and Kunduz, provincial officials told Reuters.
In Balkh, the Taliban took hostage three members of Afghanistan's spy organisation, the National Directorate of Security, according to Monir Ahmad Farhad, spokesman for Balkh provincial governor.
The Taliban did not confirm casualties on their side, but according to a spokesman for the Pamir military corps, Abdul Hadi Jamal, 54 of the insurgents were killed in clashes in Kunduz, Takhar and Baghlan provinces on Sunday night.
A spokesman for the provincial government of Maidan Wardak, Muhibullah Sharifzai, said 26 Taliban fighters were killed in clashes there.
Interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said Taliban attacks had killed 98 civilians and injured 230 others in the last two weeks across 24 provinces.
At least 12 civilians were killed on Saturday in airstrikes on a Taliban base in the northeastern province of Kunduz. Defence ministry officials said 40 Taliban fighters were killed, but they did not confirm civilian casualties. 
Despite international pressure, particularly from Washington, the Taliban continue to reject a ceasefire until the two sides reach an agreement. 
The almost daily meetings in Doha have been unable to make it past debating rules and regulations of the process, and the sides remain far apart on most matters.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's centre-left looked set to rebuff a strong challenge by the right in a regional vote, holding onto its historic Tuscan stronghold, early count projections showed on Monday, in a boost to the fragile coalition government.
As the initial count proceeded, the centre-left was forecast to hold on to three regions it already rules, while the right made one gain and stayed in charge of two other regions. 
Earlier this month, the de-facto head of the rightist bloc, League leader Matteo Salvini, had predicted a clean sweep.
In a national referendum held alongside the local ballots, Italians voted strongly in favour of cutting the number of lawmakers in the upper and lower houses of parliament to 600 from 945, projections based on an initial count showed.
An estimated 68% of voters backed the measure -- a clear victory for the co-ruling 5-Star Movement, which has championed the reform, arguing that it would reduce costs and improve parliamentary efficiency.
""This is an historic result. We can go back to having a normal parliament, with fewer privileges and 345 fewer seats,"" said Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, a top 5-Star official.
Italian sovereign debt spreads narrowed on the projections, with investors hoping the results of the Sept. 20-21 vote would bolster stability at a time when the government is battling the economic slump triggered by the coronavirus.
In the regional ballot, the right easily kept control of both Veneto and Liguria, which it already runs, while the PD looked sure to retain Campania, early vote projections showed. 
The right was on course to take Marche from the PD, but the centre-left incumbent led the field in Puglia, the heel of Italy, defying recent polls that suggested he would lose.
Most attention was fixed on the picturesque region of Tuscany, which is focused on Florence and is a centre-left stronghold. An initial projection based on very early counting, suggested the PD candidate led his challenger from the League by 4.2 percentage points.
Salvini had campaigned tirelessly in the region, as he had earlier in the year when he tried, but failed, to win another leftist bastion -- Emilia-Romagna. A loss in Tuscany would dent his hopes of trying to bring down the central government and trigger early elections. 

The seventh regional vote that took place over the past two days was in the tiny, French-speaking Valle D'Aosta. It has its own party system and a League-backed list was seen in front, a RAI exit poll said.

GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - A total of 156 countries have joined the global COVAX scheme intended to ensure fair distribution of supplies of future vaccines against COVID-19, an alliance led by the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday.
The list includes 64 wealthier, self-financing countries, and accounts for about two-thirds of the global population, a statement issued by the WHO and GAVI vaccine alliance said, after a deadline of last Friday to make binding commitments.
The goal of COVAX is by the end of 2021 to deliver 2 billion vaccine doses around the world, with healthcare workers prioritised initially and then the most vulnerable 20% of people in every participating country, regardless of income level.
While many lower-income nations are seeking assistance via COVAX, some richer countries had been reticent in confirming their intentions. Some of those who have secured their own future supplies through bilateral deals, including the United States, do not plan to join COVAX. 
The plan has highlighted the challenge of distributing vaccines equitably around the world and stirred accusations of selfish behaviour by some wealthier nations.
The vaccine alliance said it expected another 38 wealthy countries to join the initiative in coming days. 
It said it had received commitments for $1.4 billion towards vaccine research and development, but a further $700 million-$800 million was urgently needed. 

The alliance did not say which countries were only providing funding but not planning to take supply of vaccines from the scheme. France and Germany have said they will only source potential shots via the European joint procurement scheme.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - President Michel Aoun warned on Monday Lebanon was going ""to hell"" if a new government was not formed, and said agreeing one could need a miracle after positions had hardened between rival factions.
His televised address underlined the severe challenges facing French efforts to get Lebanon's fractious leaders to form a new government and rescue the country from financial meltdown.
The crisis, exacerbated by the devastating August explosion at Beirut port, marks the worst threat to Lebanon's stability since the 1975-90 civil war. A deadline agreed with Paris for forming the government passed last week. 
The process hit a logjam over the demand of Lebanon's two dominant Shi'ite parties, Iran-backed Hezbollah and its ally the Amal Movement, to name Shi'ite ministers including the finance minister. 
Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, said his proposals for compromise had not been accepted. He depicted the problem as a standoff between the Shi'ite parties on the one hand and Sunni Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib along with former prime ministers who support him on the other.
When asked where Lebanon was headed if there was no agreement, Aoun said ""of course, to hell"". 
Asked by reporters if his comments meant there was no hope of a new government, he said: ""No, there might be a miracle"".
""We are today facing a government formation crisis which should not have happened because the events that await Lebanon do not allow a minute to be wasted,"" said the president, a Maronite Christian under the country's sectarian power-sharing system. 
Aoun said the premier did not want to consult parliamentary blocs, which should not be excluded. At the same time, he added, it was not permissible for one party to impose ministers and the constitution did not allocate any ministry to any specific sect. 
""With the hardening of positions there does not appear to be any solution on the horizon because all the proposed solutions amount to a 'victor and a vanquished',"" he said.
Adib called earlier for all sides to cooperate to form a government and secure the immediate success of French efforts.
Last week, reports suggested Adib may step down. He had proposed switching control of ministries, some of which have been held by the same factions for years.
French President Emmanuel Macron had called Lebanese politicians as Paris tried pressing them to name a cabinet swiftly and embark on reforms.
""The French initiative is the only hope left. The alternative is continuing the descent into the abyss,"" said Alain Aoun, a senior member of the FPM party founded by the president, his uncle. 
The economy is collapsing after decades of state waste, graft and mounting debt. Banks have frozen people out of their savings and the currency has crashed. Inflation and poverty have soared.
With the country running out of dollars, the central bank has helped subsidize fuel, wheat and medicine imports. 

Asked about dwindling foreign currency reserves after his Monday speech, Aoun said: ""The money will run out. What can we say? (To) those in charge of managing the money, why did this happen?""

The video, released on Saturday on the People's Liberation Army Air Force Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account, came as China carried out a second day of drills near Chinese-claimed Taiwan, to express anger at the visit of a senior U.S. State Department official to Taipei.
Guam is home to major U.S. military facilities, including the air base, which would be key to responding to any conflict in the Asia-Pacific region.
The Chinese air force's two minute and 15 second video, set to solemn, dramatic music like a trailer for a Hollywood movie, shows H-6 bombers taking off from a desert base. The video is called ""The god of war H-6K goes on the attack!"" 
Halfway through, a pilot presses a button and looses off a missile at an unidentified seaside runway.
The missile homes in on the runway, a satellite image of which is shown that looks exactly like the layout of Andersen.
The music suddenly stops as images of the ground shaking appear, following by aerial views of an explosion.
""We are the defenders of the motherland's aerial security; we have the confidence and ability to always defend the security of the motherland's skies,"" the air force wrote in a brief description for the video.
Neither China's defence ministry nor U.S. Indo-Pacific Command immediately responded to requests for comment on the video.
Collin Koh, a research fellow at Singapore's Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, said the video was aimed at highlighting China's growing prowess in long-range power projection.
""The video is meant to warn the Americans that even supposedly safe, rearward positions such as Guam may come under threat when conflicts over regional flashpoints, be it Taiwan or South China Sea, erupt,"" he said.
The H-6 has been involved in multiple Chinese flights around and near Taiwan, according to Taiwan's air force, including those last week.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks and other financial market participants in the European Union will have until mid-2022 to cut their ""excessive reliance"" on derivatives clearing houses in Britain, the bloc's executive European Commission said on Monday.
Britain, which hosts Europe's biggest financial hub in London, left the EU in January and its unfettered access to the bloc ends in December.
EU financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said he has approved a proposal to allow clearing houses or central counterparties (CCPs) in Britain to continue serving EU customers for 18 months from January 2021.
""This time-limited decision has a very practical rationale, because it gives EU market participants the time they need to reduce their excessive exposures to UK-based CCPs, and EU CCPs the time to build up their clearing capability,"" Dombrovskis said in a statement.
Clearers stand between the two sides of a trade, ensuring its orderly completion even if one side goes bust.
LCH, a unit of the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE), clears the bulk of euro-denominated interest rate swaps that are widely used by companies to hedge against adverse moves in borrowing costs. ICE Clear Europe (N:ICE) is also used by EU clients.
The Bank of England, which regulates LCH, said it welcomed the EU's decision, though a time-limited one, to avoid shifting contracts in a short period which would raise financial stability risks.
As of August 2020, there were 60 trillion pounds ($76.93 trillion) of derivative contracts between clearers in Britain and their EU members, with 43 trillion of this due to expire after December, the BoE said.
Brussels and the European Central Bank want euro clearing located in the bloc where it can be directly regulated, viewed in Britain as an attack on the City of London as a global financial centre.
""Accordingly, industry is strongly encouraged to work together in developing strategies that will reduce their reliance on UK CCPs that are systemically important for the union,"" the EU executive said.
Shifting existing swaps positions worth billions of euros from London would be a complex and costly undertaking for banks.

The king, in a cabinet statement reported by state news agency BNA, reaffirmed Bahrain's support for the Palestinians and for an Arab peace initiative drawn up in 2002 that offered Israel normalised ties in return for a statehood deal with the Palestinians and full Israeli withdrawal from territory captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates became the first Arab states in a quarter of a century to normalise ties with Israel but without a resolution of Israel's dispute with the Palestinians, in a strategic realignment of Middle East countries against Iran.
The accord called for ""full diplomatic relations"" but avoided the term normalization.
""Tolerance and co-existence define our true Bahraini identity...Our steps towards peace and prosperity are not directed against any entity or power, rather they are in everyone's interest and aim for good neighbourliness,"" King Hamad said, quoted by BNA.
Sporadic street protests have broken out in Bahrain since it signed the accord with Israel earlier this month.
Bahrain was the only Gulf Arab state to witness a sizeable pro-democracy uprising in 2011, which it quashed with Saudi and Emirati help. The Sunni-ruled country accuses Shi'ite Muslim Iran of backing subversion, a charge Iran denies.

192,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",Navalny demands Russia returns his clothes for Novichok investigation,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny told Russia on Monday to hand over the clothes he was wearing when he fell into a coma last month and accused Moscow of withholding an important piece of evidence in his case. 
The outspoken opponent of President Vladimir Putin said his clothes were taken away from him before he was flown to Germany for treatment from Siberia after he became violently ill on a domestic flight. 
Berlin says tests in Germany, France and Sweden have determined he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent and the West has demanded an explanation from Russia. 
Moscow has said it is yet to see evidence of a crime and has declined to open an investigation so far, instead opening a pre-investigation probe. The Kremlin has denied any involvement. 
""Before they allowed for me to be taken to Germany, they took off all my clothes and sent me completely naked,"" Navalny wrote on his website as he recovers in a German hospital.
""Considering Novichok was found on my body, and that infection through contact is very likely, my clothes are a very important piece of evidence,"" he said.
""I demand that my clothes be carefully packed in a plastic bag and returned to me,"" he said. 
Navalny's clothes were taken by investigators and are no longer in the hospital in Siberia's Omsk where he was initially hospitalised, the RIA news agency cited the local health ministry as saying. 
Russia has said it needs to see more evidence before a formal criminal investigation is opened and has asked Germany to hand over Navalny's medical data so it can be reviewed.
""The 30 days of 'pre-investigation probe' were used to hide this important evidence,"" Navalny said.
Ivan Zhdanov, a member of Navalny's team, said Russian transport police had summoned Navalny's spokeswoman and other team members for questioning as part of the pre-investigation probe.
Zhdanov said they would not attend as a 30-day deadline for police to decide whether to open a criminal case had passed. 

The transport police said the probe was still under way and that they had questioned 200 people and planned to carry out further checks. They have also sent requests for legal assistance to Germany, France and Sweden.

Polish state prosecutors have filed a motion to arrest Czarnecki and a Warsaw court on Friday said it would consider the matter next month, sending shares in his holding company and two banks he controls sharply lower.
Czarnecki is the majority shareholder in Idea Bank and the head of its supervisory board. 
Ziobro said on Monday that if the court decides to detain Czarnecki, Poland will issue an international arrest warrant because he is abroad. The crime Czarnecki is accused of can be punished with 15 years in prison, he added.
Last year Poland's antimonopoly office said that Idea Bank misled clients when selling them bonds issued by debt collector GetBack. Idea Bank sold GetBack in March 2016.
Roman Giertych, Czarnecki's lawyer and a former politician said that Ziobro's accusations are grotesque and are related to media speculations that he might be dismissed as a result of tensions in the ruling coalition. 
""The absurdity of the allegations is additionally illustrated by the fact that my client supervises over a dozen large companies, including many banks. However, he has never been on the management board of GetBack or on the Supervisory Board of this company,"" Giertych said in a statement.
GetBack ran into trouble in 2018 when it purchased large portfolios of distressed debt at higher prices than its competitors, funding this with short-term bond issues.
The court opened an accelerated restructuring procedure for GetBack, while the financial market regulator submitted a notice of offence to the prosecutor's office in relation to the company's activities.
Idea Bank said that it wants all issues related to GetBack and its financial instruments to be analysed and explained. 

""Idea Bank is operating without any disturbance. We remain in contact with the supervision authorities...,"" the bank's press office said.

""The geopolitical situation has changed since these contracts were signed in the early 2000s. We have to assess where we can do business and it's harder for us to make that assessment regarding the Chinese market now,"" Anni Bolenius, head of communications at SSC, told Reuters.
The contracts cover weather and earth-monitoring satellites. SSC did not disclose any further details about the contracts or say how many Chinese satellites it helps operate. Bolenius said such contracts typically last around 10 years.
Earlier on Monday, SSC said it would not renew a contract that gave China access to one of its ground stations in Australia.
Last year, the Swedish Defence Research Agency said in a report that China could make military use of its access to antennas at Sweden's Esrange ground station in the far north. China has denied that any satellites that are part of the contracts with Sweden are used military purposes.

""The uncertainty about the impact on pork sales, especially exports, following the discovery is making farmers very cautious about buying more pigs for breeding,"" one trader said. ""This will also hit farmers in countries which sell piglets to Germany for fattening, such as the Netherlands and Denmark.""
Prices in Germany were around 27 euros per breeding piglet on Monday, down from around 40 euros a piglet before the first ASF case was found in Germany on Sept. 10, German animal farming association VEZG said.
Before the coronavirus crisis in March, German prices were as high as 80 euros a piglet.
""Piglet prices are at a low level but at least are stabilizing,"" another trader said. ""The weak prices are especially bad news for the Dutch and Danish piglet suppliers.""
China and other pork buyers banned imports of German pork in September after the first case was confirmed. This caused falling German pig prices and uncertainty about pork demand. [nL8N2GB3HA] [nL8N2G720E] 
The disease is not dangerous to humans but it is fatal to pigs and a massive outbreak in China, the world's biggest pork producer, has led to hundreds of millions of pigs being culled.
Some 13 ASF cases were confirmed in wild boars in the eastern state of Brandenburg up to Friday. No farm animals have been infected.

Germany's agriculture ministry has warned that more cases in wild boar are to be expected as the animals move around in groups and the disease is easily transferable. [nL8N2GF453]

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended new laws aimed at lifting restrictions on farmers on Friday after protests by opposition parties, some farming bodies and even an ally of his Bharatiya Janata Party.
India's lower house of parliament on Thursday passed three emergency executive orders issued in June by Modi's cabinet which were targeted at reforming the antiquated Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act.
This includes a rule that forces growers to sell their produce only at India's more than 7,000 regulated wholesale markets and Modi said the new legislation would ""unshackle"" millions of farmers and help them get better prices. 
""It will also remove middlemen and let farmers sell their produce directly to buyers,"" Modi said.
Many farmer organisations oppose the legislation because they say that if big buyers start buying directly from producers, small growers will hardly have any bargaining power.
""The APMC Act forces every buyer to come to wholesale markets, which is designed to help farmers get competitive, assured and timely payments,"" Dharmendra Malik, a farm leader from Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, said.
If big institutions start purchasing directly from farmers, state governments will lose out on the tax that these buyers have to pay at wholesale markets, Malik said.
""The current system ensures that farmers are paid immediately after selling their crop in the market yard itself. If farmers sell outside, who will ensure that they are paid the promised price?"" a Maharashtra state official said.
Modi has said that the wholesale markets will operate as usual as the APMC Act has not been abolished and that farmers are simply being given an option to sell directly to buyers.
But Sudhir Panwar, chief of farmers' group Kisan Jagriti Manch, said if large buyers are allowed to buy directly from farmers, wholesale markets would gradually disappear.
India's food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned on Thursday, calling the legislation ""anti-farmer"".

Badal's Shiromani Akali Dal party is a BJP ally with a strong base in Punjab, one of India's two bread basket states, where farmers form an influential voting bloc.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia sees minimal chances of extending the New START treaty with the United States - their last major nuclear arms pact - as it does not accept conditions set out by Washington, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying on Monday. 
He spoke came after Marshall Billingslea, the U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Arms Control, told a Russian newspaper that Moscow must accept a joint agreement with Washington on extending the treaty before the U.S. presidential election in November.
""I suspect that after President Trump wins re-election, if Russia has not taken up our offer, that the price of admission, as we would say in the U.S., goes up,"" Billingslea told Kommersant newspaper in an interview.
Ryabkov said that position constituted an ultimatum and lowered the chances of reaching any kind of agreement to extend the deal, which expires in February next year. 
""We cannot talk in this manner,"" TASS news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying. Another news agency, RIA, quoted him as saying the chances of a treaty extension were ""minimal"".
The New START accord, signed in 2010, limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads that Russia and the United States can deploy.
Failure to extend it would remove the main pillar maintaining the balance of nuclear arms between the two countries, adding yet another element of tension to their already fraught relationship.
DISAGREEMENT ON CHINA
Billingslea said the U.S. side was looking for a framework political accord on extending New START. This framework, which would not have to be ratified by the U.S. Senate, would stipulate that a successor to New START must be multilateral and include China, he told Kommersant.
Ryabkov called that a ""deliberate distortion of our position."" He said China's decision on whether to take part in the talks was exclusively Beijing's to make. 
""We have not taken and do not intend to take any steps to bring China into these talks, something we have told our American colleagues on multiple occasions,"" TASS quoted Ryabkov as saying.
New START is a successor to the original Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) signed in 1991 between the then-Soviet Union and the United States.

Arms deals between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1980s, and their successors George H.W. Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s, underscored growing trust between the superpowers at that time and proved a contributor towards ending the Cold War.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar plans to push ahead with a November general election despite calls from opposition parties to postpone it because of a surge in novel coronavirus cases, officials said.
The Southeast Asian country reported 671 new cases of the coronavirus on Sunday, its highest daily toll since the beginning of its outbreak in March, taking its total to 5,541 infections and 92 deaths.
Myanmar had gone weeks without a case of local transmission before an outbreak in August in the western region of Rakhine that has spread across the country.
Analysts say the Nov. 8 election is a test of the extent of Myanmar's democratic reforms.
Parties halted campaigning in the commercial capital of Yangon on Monday after authorities imposed a citywide lockdown, forcing the majority of its five million residents to work from home in the toughest measure yet to combat the virus.
But the polls will go ahead, the national election commission told reporters.
""We don't have a plan to postpone the election for the reason of COVID-19,"" Myint Naing, a senior commission official told an online briefing on the weekend.
He said the number of polling stations would be increased from 40,000 to 50,000, to avoid overcrowding, staff would wear protective gear and voters would be told to wash their hands.
""We have arranged the situation so that there's nothing to worry about,"" he said.
Monywa Aung Shin, a senior official from the ruling National League for Democracy party, told Reuters he believed the election would make no difference to the trajectory of the pandemic.
""It is better to face the danger,"" he said.
Last week, 24 parties sent a letter to the election commission urging it to reconsider the polls.
""As a party that looks after the interests of the people, we suggested the commission consider moving the date,"" Nandar Hla Myint, a spokesman for the military-backed opposition Union Solidarity and Development Party, which proposed the delay, told Reuters.
Political analyst Yan Myo Thein said parties were moving their campaigns onto social media platforms because of the pandemic but needed more time to organise.
""Many voters are in remote areas and it is difficult to know how much access they have to online campaigns,"" he said.
Moe Kyaw, the secretary of the Arakan League for Democracy, one of the major parties in Rakhine State, which has been in lockdown for weeks, said candidates were unable to visit voters because of the restrictions.
""COVID is limiting our ability to campaign,"" Moe Kyaw told Reuters by telephone.
There are also internet curbs in parts of the state because of fighting between government troops and ethnic minority insurgents.
Yangon was quiet on Monday with markets and malls shuttered. Some people praised the government for its measures to curb the virus.
""The situation would be uncontrollably chaotic if the rules were not tight enough,” said resident Win Myint.

206,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Potential Trump Supreme Court pick Lagoa is fast-rising Cuban-American judicial star,"By Jan Wolfe
(Reuters) - Barbara Lagoa, the Cuban-American federal appellate judge under consideration by President Donald Trump for the U.S. Supreme Court, is a conservative jurist whose resume includes a role in a heated international custody battle and the distinction of being the first Hispanic woman to serve on Florida's top court.
If picked by Trump and confirmed by the U.S. Senate to replace liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died of pancreatic cancer at age 87 on Friday, Lagoa, 52, would become only the second Hispanic to serve on the Supreme Court, following current Justice Sonia Sotomayor. She would give the court a 6-3 conservative majority.
Lagoa has less than a year of experience as a federal judge, having joined the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last December after being appointed by Trump and confirmed by the Senate in a 80-15 bipartisan vote. The 11th Circuit is one of the regional appeals courts that are one step below the Supreme Court.
A victory in Florida is seen as crucial for Trump's Nov. 3 re-election chances. Choosing a Hispanic judge from the state potentially could give him a boost among Florida's voters.
While Lagoa has not served long on the 11th Circuit, she took part in a major ruling reversing a judge's decision striking down a Florida law that requires that people with past serious criminal convictions pay all fines, restitution and legal fees before regaining the right to vote. Critics have compared the Republican-backed law to poll taxes imposed in the past in some states to keep Black people from voting.
Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a close ally of Trump, named Lagoa to the Florida Supreme Court - his first official act in the job - in January 2019, a major career boost for the former federal prosecutor who had served on an intermediate state court since being appointed by Republican former Governor Jeb Bush in 2006.
Lagoa is a member of Florida's large and politically influential Cuban-American community. Her parents fled Cuba after Fidel Castro's communist revolution. She grew up in Hialeah outside Miami, graduated from Florida International University and earned her law degree at Columbia University, the same Ivy League school as Ginsburg did.
ELIAN GONZALEZ INCIDENT
In 2000, she played a role in a major international incident between the United States and Cuba involving a 5-year-old boy named Elian Gonzalez who was rescued from the ocean after his mother drowned while fleeing Cuba with him. The boy's father in Cuba sought his return and a legal battle ensued. 
Lagoa provided free legal services to Cuban-American relatives of the boy who had sought to keep him in the United States. Ultimately, he was sent back to Cuba.
Lagoa has said her parents' flight from Castro's Cuba shaped her views and career.
""In the country my parents fled, the whim of a single individual could mean the difference between food or hunger, liberty or prison, life or death,"" Lagoa said at an event last year. ""Unlike the country my parents fled, we are a nation of laws, not of men.""
The liberal activist group Alliance for Justice has said Lagoa's decisions ""raise concerns that she will side with the wealthy and powerful at the expense of everyday Americans as a federal judge.""
It also cited a 2019 ruling in which Lagoa sided with businesses challenging Miami Beach's minimum wage, as well as a decision she joined that made it harder for homeowners to fight foreclosure proceedings.
That year, Lagoa upheld DeSantis' suspension of a sheriff for alleged incompetence following a mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida.
Trump's advisers see Lagoa as someone who would be a reliable conservative vote on the Supreme Court, said University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias, who studies judicial nominations.
Leonard Leo, who has been a key figure in the Federalist Society conservative legal group and worked closely with Trump on his Supreme Court appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, interviewed and endorsed Lagoa when she was under consideration for Florida's top court.
""She doesn't shy away from her Federalist Society credentials and being conservative,"" Tobias said.
The Florida Family Policy Council, a group that opposes legalized abortion and LGBT rights, said last year Lagoa ""has a conservative judicial philosophy"" and ""is also deeply committed to her faith."" Lagoa is Roman Catholic and attends a church in Miami. 
In her interview for the Florida Supreme Court, Lagoa described herself as a ""legal nerd."" 
""I am a tough questioner and I ask pointed questions, but I always do so respectfully,"" Lagoa said.

Lagoa's husband, Paul Huck Jr., is a lawyer in the Miami office of Jones Day, a law firm often involved in Republican causes. They have three daughters. Lagoa's father-in-law, Paul Huck Sr., is a semi-retired federal judge in Miami, appointed by Democratic former President Bill Clinton. She speaks fluent Spanish.

207,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>","Advisory: As U.S. presidential election approaches, Reuters/Ipsos begins weekly state polls","By Chris Kahn
NEW YORK (Reuters) - While President Donald Trump trails Democrat Joe Biden in national public opinion polls, he does not need popular support to get re-elected, just a majority of votes in enough large, competitive states to win the Electoral College.
With that in mind, Reuters on Monday begins taking a closer look at America's swing states with polls nearly every week from now until Election Day on Nov. 3 in Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. 
Here is why Reuters decided to focus on those states, and what it will be looking for in the data.
WHAT IS SO INTERESTING ABOUT THESE STATES?
All six states have been competitive in recent elections, with nearly the same number of voters backing Democrats as Republicans. All six are large enough to tip a close election to either candidate.
In 2016, Trump won three of those states -- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan -- by less than 1 percentage point, and a fourth, Florida, by less than 2 points. Those states shifted the race decisively in the Republican's favor, netting Trump 75 of his 306 total electoral votes that year.
That Electoral College margin meant that Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.
This year, pre-election polls show that Biden is currently leading Trump in support by a few percentage points among likely voters in those states. But in some, like Florida, Biden's advantage in support has been shrinking. 
WHAT QUESTIONS WILL REUTERS ASK?
Besides their support for the president, the Reuters/Ipsos state polls will measure respondents' interest in voting and what is driving their vote choice this year. 
The polls will ask respondents about their perceptions of the United States: whether they think the country and the economy are headed in the right direction, their concerns about COVID-19 and their support for Black Lives Matter. The poll will also ask them which presidential candidate would be better at fixing the country's problems. 
The Reuters/Ipsos polls will also follow the latest news from the 2020 race and insert topical questions as they come up on the campaign trail.
WHAT WILL REUTERS LOOK FOR IN THE DATA?
The most interesting findings will come after the questions have been asked multiple times over a few weeks, revealing any changes in support for the candidates. 
This occurred four years ago, when national support for Democrat Hillary Clinton eroded in the final two weeks before the election, transforming what had been a comfortable lead in October into a dead heat in November. 
As of September 2020, roughly 1 in 10 likely voters have yet to pick a major-party candidate, according to Reuters/Ipsos national polling, meaning that Biden's small leads in some battleground states could disappear once all voters make up their minds. 
Besides shifts in support for the candidates, Reuters will also isolate the population of undecided voters. It will measure this group's political leanings and their support for various issues. This could provide insights about their decision-making. 
HOW OFTEN WILL REUTERS POLL BATTLEGROUND STATES?

In June, Turkish military support helped Sarraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) repel an assault on Tripoli by Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), which is supported by Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.
President Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey was upset by Sarraj's announcement that he planned to quit, but Kalin said Turkish support for the GNA and their bilateral agreements, which include a security pact signed last year, would continue.
Turkish officials may travel to Tripoli ""in the coming days"" to discuss developments, he added.
""These accords will not be impacted by this political period because these are decisions made by the government, not by any individual,"" Kalin told Demiroren News Agency. 
The GNA declared a ceasefire last month and called for the lifting of a months-long blockade on oil output. The leader of a rival parliament in eastern Libya also appealed for a halt to hostilities, offering hope for a de-escalation of the conflict across Libya since a 2011 uprising.

Haftar dismissed the calls, but said on Friday he would lift for one month his blockade on oil outputs and that he had agreed with the GNA on ""fair distribution"" of energy revenue.

Tensions have approached boiling point in recent weeks as a small coalition party headed by ultra-conservative Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro demanded the government take a tougher stance against gay rights and EU climate policy.
The parties also disagree over animal rights, and government plans to give officials immunity from prosecution for decisions taken to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
The main coalition party, Law and Justice, says Warsaw needs to be more pragmatic so as not to further strain relations with the European Union, already tense over Brussels' accusations PiS is subverting the rule of law.
""Today the situation is that there is no coalition and we will be discussing within PiS what's next. All scenarios are on the table,"" Krzysztof Sobolewski, a top official at PiS, told public radio on Monday. 
Sobolewski and other PiS representatives indicated that a minority government and then snap election was a possible scenario, although the situation is ""dynamic"", he said. 
""It is difficult to imagine a minority government functioning for the next three years,"" the prime minister's chief of staff, Michal Dworczyk, told private television broadcaster TVN24. Dworczyk also said the head of PiS, Poland's de facto leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, could become prime minister or deputy prime minister.
The PiS-led coalition holds 235 of the 460 seats in the lower house and would lose its majority without United Poland, which has 17 seats.
The coalition parties are seen as anxious to avoid a new election. If one were held now, polls show PiS would fall short of a majority and its two smaller coalition partners would fail to meet the threshold to win seats.

Addressing a parliamentary panel examining how Rio legally destroyed sacred and historically significant rockshelters in Western Australia state, the head of the Yinhawangka Aboriginal Corporation said Rio had stopped short of promising any review.
""Rio have stated in various forums that they will consider reviewing the agreement....(but) we don’t have a formal commitment,"" Chief Executive Grant Bussell told the inquiry. 
Rio's Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques and two deputies said this month they would step down following a public outcry over the incident in the state's Pilbara region, and how the company handled it.
Rio had not done an adequate job of protecting an existing sacred site, Yinhawangka archaeologist Anna Fagan told the inquiry, raising concerns over how the rest of the cultural heritage would be managed. 
""We have 327 heritage sites and 124 will be destroyed by the Western Ranges expansion project by Rio Tinto,"" she said.
The inquiry has revealed that Indigenous groups have been subject to confidential contracts barring them from objecting to any mining development on their ancestral land, prompting questions over whether the miners gained full and fair consent.
""No one says, in return for getting these (agreements), you don’t have any rights in protecting your country,"" Bussell said.
Peer BHP has promised not to act on historical approvals to damage sites while it held fresh talks with traditional owners.
In a statement, Rio said it was building on decades of deep engagement as it assessed the sites to gain better understanding of ""the cultural significance and values placed on these sites by the Yinhawangka People.""

It added that it had committed to modernise its pacts, including details around the issue of consent, with all the groups on whose lands it operates in the Pilbara.

213,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 04:51AM ET</span>",Around 270 whales stranded on sandbar off Australia's Tasmania,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Marine biologists were planning the rescue of around 270 whales stranded on a sandbar off the remote west coast of the Australian island of Tasmania on Monday.
Government scientists said it appeared that at least 25 of the animals, believed to be pilot whales, had already died. Pilot whales are a species of oceanic dolphin that grows 7 metres (23 ft) long and can weigh up to 3 tonnes.
""While strandings are not uncommon in Tasmania, and while strandings of this scale aren't (unprecedented), we certainly haven't had one for at least 10 years,"" Nic Deka, a regional manager for Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service, said.
Tasmania's Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment said the whales were stranded in three groups in shallow water at Macquarie Heads, some 200 kms (120 miles) northwest of the state capital Hobart.
Rescuers with specialised equipment arrived at the site on Monday afternoon to assess the situation. They were expected to regroup on the shore as it grew dark to discuss a rescue strategy.
Officials usually respond to reports of strandings of dolphins and whales in Tasmania once every two or three weeks, on average.
Government scientists had first thought the mass stranding involved about 70 whales when it was viewed from the air, but a closer inspection revealed the larger number.
The last mass stranding off the coast of Tasmania was in 2009, when around 200 whales beached themselves. In 2018, more than 100 pilot whales died after beaching themselves off the coast of New Zealand.
It is not known why whales, which travel together in pods, sometimes beach themselves but they are known to follow a leader, as well as gather around an injured or distressed whale.

""Their social groups and strong bonding between the groups causes often all of them to strand,"" Olaf Meynecke, a whale researcher and Project Manager of whales and climate at Griffith University, told Reuters.

The proposed package would include a favourable trade regime with the EU, visa-free travel and support in negotiations to enter the World Trade Organization, according to the statement from the three presidents to the EU leaders seen by Reuters.
Financial assistance for reforms, and help to diversify its energy sector and transition towards liberal economy was also part of the support package.
The support would only be offered after ""new, democratic elections"" with interational observers in the country, the Lithuanian president's office told Reuters.
""If Belarus citizens decide to undergo political and economic reforms in the country, to establish independent institutions to defend human rights and freedom of speech - we will help with our knowledge and experience"", Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said in a statement.
Poland wants the European Union to offer Belarus financial assistance of at least 1 billion euros ($1.18 billion) as part of a ""Marshal plan"" to rebuild the country, Prime Minster Mateusz Morawiecki said last Thursday.
Belarus was plunged into turmoil following a presidential election last month that President Alexander Lukashenko says he won by a landslide, but the opposition says was rigged. In power for 26 years, he has shown scant inclination to resign, buoyed by support from Russia.
The EU has said it would impose sanctions on Minsk for alleged election fraud and human rights abuses but has yet to do so.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A plaque placed by Thai protesters to declare that Thailand belongs to the people and not the king was removed from near the Grand Palace in Bangkok overnight and police said on Monday they may charge those behind the symbolic gesture.
The plaque was cemented in place on Sunday after a rally by tens of thousands of people who cheered calls for reforms to the monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the latest challenge since activists broke a longstanding taboo on criticising him.
Police said the plaque had been handed over by officials from the Bangkok city authority and the government's Fine Arts Department. One officer said it was ""to keep as evidence to press charges against protesters"".
Protesters voiced little surprise that the brass plaque had been removed after less than a day.
Protest leader Parit ""Penguin"" Chiwarak told reporters an electronic file of the plaque was being shared to enable people to make more of them and place them wherever they want.
""The plaque was already placed in the hearts of people. You may remove it but we will make a new one,"" he said.
Protesters have grown ever bolder during two months of demonstrations against Thailand's palace and military-dominated establishment. 
Criticising the monarchy is illegal under lese majeste laws, but recent arrests of more than a dozen activists - including Parit - were made on other grounds. All have since been released on bail.
Sunday's demonstration was the biggest since the 2014 coup that brought Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to power. Protesters called for his removal and for a new constitution and elections as well as for the royal reforms.
On Monday, Prayuth welcomed the fact the protest was peaceful.
""Nation, religion and monarchy are the upmost pillars of the Thai people,” he told reporters.
The demonstrators say the constitution gives the king too much power and that it was engineered to allow Prayuth to keep power after elections last year. He says that vote was fair.
The symbolism of the plaque is its resemblance to one that had commemorated the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 and which was removed from outside a royal palace in 2017, after Vajiralongkorn took the throne.
The plaque says ""this country belongs to the people and is not the property of the monarch as they have deceived us.""
Craig Kunakorn, 33, a barber who had been at the protests came to visit the spot where the plaque had been cemented into the ground on Monday.

""Everyone knew it would disappear soon but the success of creating it is something that will continue. It is still an important symbol,"" he said.

216,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>",Deep divisions as Afghan negotiators get down to details,"By Abdul Qadir Sediqi and Hamid Shalizi
KABUL (Reuters) - The Afghan government and Taliban militants remain far apart on even the most basic issues a week into talks meant to end two decades of war that has killed tens of thousands of people.
The chasm, not just on the predictably thorny problem of a ceasefire but on foundational issues, suggests major hurdles to any hopes of binding the wounds of a ravaged country.
Despite the difficulties, the talks are the best hope for peace in years and come as a result of a February pact between the Taliban and the United States, allowing U.S. forces to withdraw in exchange for Taliban promises on terrorism.
But the Taliban have refused to agree to a ceasefire and the war is grinding on. About 40 people were killed in Taliban attacks last week.
With all foreign troops due to be gone by May next year, pressure is building on the U.S.-backed government as it grapples with how it can share power with its implacable foe or contend with a likely Taliban push for military victory.
Since the spotlight faded from the lavish Sept. 12 opening ceremony in a hotel ballroom in the Qatari capital, Doha, attended by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the two sides have only confirmed that they are diametrically opposed on virtually every issue.
""We are talking to a side that is difficult and inflexible and therefore things are not moving forward,"" said a senior negotiator on the Afghan government side.
The two sides will have to tackle a diverse range of issues to secure peace, from the legitimacy of the Kabul government to women's rights.
""The first week has demonstrated how complex the talks will be in general, with the most crucial one being Afghanistan's future political system,"" said Graham (NYSE:GHM) Smith, an independent analyst tracking closely the talks based in Afghanistan. 
The Taliban emerged in the early 1990s from the chaos of factional strife between the Islamists who had battled occupying Soviet forces in the 1980s.
WISH FOR PEACE
Founded by religious students, the Pakistan-backed fighters brought a welcome but harsh peace, along with contempt for women's rights, blocking their education, forcing nearly all to quit work, restricting their movement and brutally enforcing a strict dress code.
In recent months, the Taliban have said they will respect women's rights under sharia but many educated woman who have come of age since the Taliban were ousted in 2001 for harbouring al Qaeda leader Osama bin laden have doubts.
Women could be the first casualty of the talks, some activists fear, if the government allows the rolling back of their rights to appease the Taliban.
Three diplomats overseeing the so-called intra-Afghan negotiations told Reuters the talks had bogged down over the finer points of Islamic law. 
The government and Taliban both follow the Hanafi school of jurisprudence within Sunni Islam, but their interpretations of sharia law are ""staunchly different"", said a senior Western diplomat in Doha who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the talks.
This affects positions on key issues like punishments for crime, women's rights and freedom of speech.
President Ashraf Ghani's spokesman questioned what he said was the Taliban insistence on settling the issue of the Islamic system so early in the talks.
""This doesn't resonate well with our people's wish for a lasting peace and the current political system of Afghanistan which is an Islamic Republic state and has legitimacy,"" said the spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi.
One of the diplomats trying to shepherd the talks said the focus was for now on keeping the negotiators at the table, talking over tea in the Gulf capital, 2,000 km (1,200 miles) from their war-scarred home.
""They're carving up their playing field, the challenge for us is to make sure that no one leaves the field,"" said the diplomat.

TAITUNG, Taiwan (Reuters) - In the forests and on remote offshore islands of Taiwan, a group of conservationists are racing to collect as many rare plant species as they can before they are lost to climate change and human encroachment.
Overseen by the Dr. Cecilia Koo Botanic Conservation Centre, the plant hunters are scouring sub-tropical Taiwan for as many rare plant samples as they can find, from the rugged eastern coast around Taitung to Dongyin, in the Matsu archipelago.
""I started collecting plants when I was still at school. I didn't used to think it was that important. But since I began working at the conservation centre, I have realised that many (living) things that used to be there, are there no longer,"" said Hung Hsin-chieh, a research assistant at the conservation centre.
""So for many things, if you don't conserve them properly then perhaps in the future you'll no longer be able to find them.""
Industrialised Taiwan is best known for its mass production of technological goods.
While it has a heavily populated, sometimes polluted, western coastal plain, about 70% of the island is covered in dense, mountainous forest, which is home to deer, wild boar and a threatened population of Formosan black bears.
(Graphic: Searching for Taiwan's disappearing plant species - https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-CHANGE/TAIWAN-PLANTS/gjnpwjwwkvw/chart.png)
Taiwan's government has made environmental protection and a shift to renewable energy a key priority, but the island still ranks poorly when it comes to tackling climate change.
Last year's Climate Change Performance Index ranked Taiwan third to last in the world, its worst rating ever, though Taiwan's government disputed the data.
The plant hunters face considerable obstacles, from steep cliff-faces to heavy rains.
""Not everyone can get to the places I go to. I can stay a long time out in the wild, in the mountains or forests. I go in scattered directions. I am very good at climbing trees - not everyone can climb trees,"" Hung said. 
Cheng Ken-yu, the moss and bryophyta collection manager at the centre, said some of the plants they collect may have properties people can use.
""Then we'll have these species that we can use. Or perhaps one day when a certain habitat needs this specific species, we can provide it.""
The goal is to ensure Taiwan's biodiversity is protected and that rare species that may have died out in their original habitat can one day be re-introduced.

""We hope that these species have a chance to return to their original habitat. Or one day, when we wish to create a (new) habitat, these species are able to live there happily,"" said Cheng.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland, which last fought a foreign war more than 200 years ago and has no discernable enemies, wants to spend billions on new fighter jets.
Many oppose the idea, saying the neutral country neither can afford nor needs cutting-edge warplanes to defend Alpine territory which a supersonic jet can cross in 10 minutes.
Ireland, Malta and Luxembourg don't have jets, they say, making the 6 billion Swiss franc ($6.6 billion) plan a waste of money.
""Who is our enemy? Who is attacking a small, neutral country - surrounded by NATO?"" asked Priska Seiler Graf, a member of parliament for the left-leaning Social Democrats. ""It's really absurd."" 
Voters get their say on Sunday Sept. 27. Approving funding in the binding referendum would let the government decide next year among the Eurofighter from Airbus, the Rafale from France's Dassault, Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s F/A-18 Super Hornet, or the  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F35-A Lightning II.
The aircraft would replace Switzerland's aging fleet of 30 F/A-18 Hornets which will go out of service in 2030.
Seiler Graf said cheaper alternatives, such as a fighter version of Leonardo's M346 trainer, offered better value than the ""expensive toys"" under consideration.  
""We need new aircraft, that is not disputed, but buying lighter, simpler aircraft would be enough,"" she said. ""It would be better to have a Fiat than a Maserati.""
Voters six years ago rejected the purchase of Gripen jets from Sweden. In 1989 a proposal to scrap its entire army got 35% of voter support.
Pollster Lukas Golder from GFS.Bern said voters are likely to back the plan to buy the jets. Armed neutrality is crucial to how Switzerland defines itself, he said, going back to the belief a strong army deterred invasion by Nazi Germany in World War II. The Pope's Swiss guards are also a reminder of the country's mercenary past.
Lawmaker Thomas Hurter from the right-wing Swiss People's Party, a former air force pilot, said Switzerland had to protect itself without relying on other countries.
""If we don't replace these old aircraft, that means we have no air force, there is no protection any more and we are not fulfilling our constitution,"" he said.
Smaller jets could not fly high enough, he said, or have the acceleration needed to react quickly to emergencies. 
""We don't know what's going to happen in the next 50 years,"" Hurter said. ""You need to have the fire brigade ready when there is a burning house, otherwise it's too late.""

BERN (Reuters) - Up to 400 protesters occupied a square near the Swiss National Bank and parliament in Bern on Monday, as leaders of a group that has also targeted banks including  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said they sought to highlight government inaction on climate change. 
A spokeswoman for the protesters, from various environmental campaign organisations, said they were building a camp at the so-called Federal Square in the heart of Bern's political centre to highlight demands to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2030. 
About 40 protesters chained themselves to objects or to each other to prevent them from being removed easily by police, should authorities object, a Reuters witness said.
""We woke up quite early and came here to the Federal Square to...demand net zero by 2030 and climate justice now,"" said Frida Kohlmann, the spokeswoman. ""We will be here from today until Friday.

""We root for Donald Trump's victory, because we know well American Democratic governments' diplomacy, built on moral imperialism. We have been forced to sample it before, we did not like it, we do not want seconds,"" Orban wrote in an essay.
Nationalist Orban faces a steep challenge to his decade-long rule in parliamentary elections due in early 2022 as Hungary braces for the economic and social impact of a second wave of coronavirus infections.
The vote would be decisive as the international liberal elite was out to destroy Christian conservatives in Europe, he wrote in the pro-government daily Magyar Nemzet.
""They prepare for a decisive battle in 2022, backed by the international media, Brussels bureaucrats, and NGOs disguised as civil organisations,"" Orban said. ""It is time for us to line up too."" 
Hungary and other central European countries would place economic efficiency over European Union policies such as ""climate goals elevated to absurdity, a social Europe, a common tax code and a multicultural society"", he said.
The EU will try to implement the multi-trillion euro post-pandemic revival plan with key political discussions yet to be conducted among member states, some of which want to regulate the self-styled illiberal Orban much more strongly.
The idea of strict conditions on the disbursement of EU aid and funds to the rule of law has prompted a threat of veto for the whole package from Orban, who said the system was more aptly described as ""rule of blackmail.""

Orban said the outcome much depended on the succession battle in Germany as Chancellor Angela Merkel's term nears an end.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - China will lose access to a strategic space tracking station in Western Australia when its contract expires, the facility's owners said, a decision that cuts into Beijing's expanding space exploration and navigational capabilities in the Pacific region.
The Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) has had a contract allowing Beijing access to the satellite antenna at the ground station since at least 2011. It is located next to an SSC satellite station primarily used by the United States and its agencies, including NASA.
The Swedish state-owned company told Reuters it would not enter into any new contracts at the Australian site to support Chinese customers after its current contract expires. However, it did not disclose when the lease runs out.
""Given the complexity of the Chinese market, brought about by the overall geopolitical situation, SSC has decided to focus mainly on other markets for the coming years,"" the SSC said in an emailed response to questions.
The site is owned by SSC subsidiary, SSC Space Australia.
The Australian government did not immediately respond to questions on Monday.
The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The expansion of China's space capabilities, which includes the growing sophistication of its Beidou navigation network, is one of the new frontiers of tension between the U.S. and China, who are clashing on everything from technology and trade to Chinese activities in the disputed South China Sea.
Australia has a strong alliance with the United States, which includes working together on space research and programmes, while Canberra's diplomatic and trade ties with Beijing have also been fracturing.
China last used the Yatharagga Satellite Station, located about 350 km (250 miles) north of the Australian city of Perth, in June 2013 to support the three-person Shenzhou 10 mission which completed a series of space docking tests, SSC said.
The SSC said the current contract supports Chinese scientific space missions within its programme for manned-space flights for telemetry, tracking and command services.
OVERSEAS EXPANSION
Ground stations are a vital part of space programmes given they create a telecommunications link with spacecraft. While stations have different capabilities, they can be equipped to co-ordinate satellites for civil-military Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as Beidou, Russia's GLONASS, the European Union's Galileo system and U.S.-owned GPS.
China's space programme has been increasing its access to overseas ground stations in recent years in line with the expansion of its space exploration and navigational programmes.
""Generally speaking anywhere you put a GNSS monitoring ground station will improve the accuracy of positioning for that region,"" said Joon Wayn Cheong, a senior research associate at the University of New South Wales' School of Electrical Engineering.
Christopher Newman, professor of Space Law and Policy at Northumbria University in Newcastle, England, said China wants to remove its dependence on GPS as part of broader plans to expand its global influence. 
""GPS could be made unavailable to them in a military conflict. An independent secure system is crucial for the capabilities of the People's Liberation Army in respect to targeting, weapons, navigation,"" Newman told Reuters. 
Beijing last year re-established diplomatic ties with the small Pacific island nation of Kiribati, where it has a mothballed ground station in the central Pacific Ocean.

Thousands of health workers, who call themselves ""priso-nurses"", had appealed to the government to let them travel, Reuters reported last week. The nurses say they feel underpaid, under-appreciated and unprotected in the Philippines.
President Rodrigo Duterte approved the proposal of the labour ministry to expand exemptions from the ban to those who had overseas contracts and complete documents as of Aug. 31, spokesman Harry Roque told a regular briefing.
So far only those with contracts as of March 8 have been allowed to travel.
Roque said the president's decision would benefit 1,500 health personnel. 
""These are nurses who already spent a lot (of money) processing their papers. They are not that many so we allowed them to leave,"" Roque said. 
Healthcare workers from the Philippines are on the front lines of the pandemic at hospitals in the United States, Europe and the Middle East as well as at home.
Duterte's government in April barred nurses, doctors and other medical workers from leaving, saying they were needed to fight the coronavirus crisis in the Philippines, which is still tackling its first wave of infections.
The country has the highest number of recorded coronavirus infections in Southeast Asia with 286,743 cases. Its 4,984 deaths are second only to Indonesia.
But Roque insisted there was no reason to panic and said: ""We are in control.""
""We know the enemy and we know how to fight the enemy through isolation, tracing and treatment,"" Roque added.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - World leaders will come together, virtually, on Monday to mark the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, as the deadly coronavirus pandemic challenges the effectiveness and solidarity of the 193-member world body.
As COVID-19, which emerged in China late last year, began to spread around the world, forcing millions of people to shelter at home and dealing a devastating economic blow, countries turned inward and diplomats say the United Nations struggled to assert itself.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told Reuters that the pandemic has exposed the world's fragilities. He plans to tell world leaders on Monday that they need to work together at a time when there is a surplus of multilateral challenges and deficit of solutions. 
The 15-member Security Council took months to back a call by Guterres for a global ceasefire - to allow countries to focus on fighting COVID-19 - due to bickering between the world's biggest powers: China and the United States.
The 193-member General Assembly only adopted an omnibus resolution on a ""comprehensive and coordinated response"" to the pandemic earlier this month and it was not by consensus. The United States and Israel voted no.
A $10.3 billion U.N. appeal to fund fighting the pandemic in vulnerable and low-income countries is only a quarter funded. Guterres now has taken a lead in pushing to make sure any vaccine for the coronavirus is made available to everyone globally. 
A senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the General Assembly should have acted months ago, but ""we were all hampered by, and hit, by the COVID-19."" 
'MOMENTS OF DISAPPOINTMENT'
The United Nations headquarters is in New York, which was hit hard by the coronavirus. U.N. member states had to decide how to work virtually, which they did for several months before resuming some in-person meetings recently. 
""We all suffered from the fact that we couldn't meet ... A lot of attention was paid to process more than substance unfortunately,"" said the European diplomat. ""I wouldn't put the blame on the U.N. as an organization, it's the member states that have to be more assertive and positive."" 
A U.N. report released on Monday found that six out of ten people believe the United Nations has made the world a better place, but looking ahead three-quarters see the world body as essential in tackling global challenges. 
""However, at the same time, over half still see the U.N. as remote from their lives and say they don't know much about it,"" the report said. 
The one-day special event on Monday comes ahead of the annual meeting of world leaders at the United Nations, which starts on Tuesday with no presidents or prime ministers physically present in New York. All statements have been pre-recorded and will be broadcast in the General Assembly hall.
The United Nations was created when countries came together after World War Two to prevent another such conflict. While there has not been World War Three, leaders will adopt a statement on Monday acknowledging ""moments of disappointment.""
""Our world is not yet the world that our founders envisaged 75 years ago. It is plagued by growing inequality, poverty, hunger, armed conflicts, terrorism, insecurity, climate change and pandemics,"" the statement says. 
""All this calls for greater action, not less,"" it says.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2020 11:55PM ET</span>",Explainer: Why is Taiwan-China tension rising and what are the risks?,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - China sent numerous aircraft close to Taiwan during two days of drills from Friday, causing the island's air force to scramble, as Beijing expressed anger at the visit of a senior U.S. official to Taipei.
WHY IS TENSION RISING NOW?
China claims democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory, to be taken by force if needed, a threat the island has lived with since 1949, when defeated Kuomintang, or Nationalist, forces fled there after their defeat by the Communists in the Chinese civil war.
China has been angered by stepped-up U.S. support for Taiwan, including two visits in as many months by top officials, one in August by Health Secretary Alex Azar and the other last week by Keith Krach, the undersecretary for economic affairs.
In addition, the United States is planning major new arms sales to Taiwan. China views all these steps as effectively being U.S. support for Taiwan independence, with the eventual establishment of a Republic of Taiwan, a red line for Beijing.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says the island is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name, and that the People's Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan and has no right to.
China calls Taiwan its most important and sensitive issue in U.S. ties. For China's ruling Communist Party, Taiwan is the last part of the nation still awaiting ""liberation"" after the 1949 victory, adding an extra historical significance.
WHAT ARE THE RISKS?
Taiwan and China do not have an official dialogue mechanism, meaning that any accidental clash between their fighter jets, for example, could quickly spiral out of control.
Taiwan's air force now regularly scrambles to see off approaching Chinese aircraft.
A conflict over Taiwan may suck in the United States and its Asian allies, though it is an open question whether Washington would, or could, come to Taipei's aid.
China may quickly overwhelm Taiwan with missile and cyber attacks before the United States even has a chance to respond.
However, any war would be damaging for China too, in terms of its international reputation and economically, especially if it is subject to broad Western economic sanctions. 
WHY IS TAIWAN STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT? 
Not only is Taiwan in a key geographic location on the edge of the Pacific between the disputed South China Sea and Japan, but it is a tech powerhouse, home to the world's biggest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd.
The United States views China's tech firms as a security risk and has moved to cut off its access to advanced chips, including those from Taiwan.
HOW DO THE ARMED FORCES OF THE TWO SIDES COMPARE?
Taiwan's military is well-trained and well-armed, but is dwarfed by China's People's Liberation Army, which is adding stealth fighters, aircraft carriers and advanced missiles in the throes of an impressive modernisation programme.
Tsai has made upgrading Taiwan's military a priority, stressing ""asymmetric warfare"", to make any attack as painful and as difficult for China as possible. This could include, for example, pinpoint strikes by long-range missiles on targets in China.
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A WAR BETWEEN TAIWAN AND CHINA?
While China could easily overwhelm Taiwan with missiles and air attacks, it has other options to bring the island to its knees, such as cyberattacks to take down basic infrastructure, or a naval blockade to force surrender.

Whatever happens, the reaction of the United States will be crucial.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Authorities have arrested a person suspected of sending the deadly poison ricin in an envelope addressed to the White House but intercepted before it could be delivered there, a law enforcement source said on Sunday.
In response to a Reuters query seeking confirmation of media reports that a woman accused of mailing the ricin-tainted letter had been taken into custody at the U.S.-Canadian border, the FBI field office in Washington issued a statement saying: “An arrest was made of an individual allegedly responsible for sending a suspicious letter."" 
The statement added: ""The investigation is ongoing."" 
The law enforcement source, familiar with the case but speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the ""suspicious letter"" referred to in the FBI statement was the same as the envelope found to have contained ricin.
The source also said the person arrested was a woman of Canadian citizenship.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Saturday that it had received a request for assistance from the FBI in the investigation and that the suspicious letter in question appeared to have been sent from Canada.
The RCMP further stated that an FBI analysis of a substance inside the envelope detected ""the presence of ricin,"" a highly toxic agent derived from castor beans. 
While naturally occurring, the toxin requires a deliberate act to convert it into a biological weapon, with exposure to an amount as small as a pinhead capable of causing death within 36 to 72 hours. No known antidote exists.
Initially asked about the incident on Saturday, the FBI said it had joined the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in the investigation of ""a suspicious letter received at a U.S. government mail facility.""
The envelope was intercepted at a U.S. government mail center before it could be delivered to the White House.
The Secret Service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police both declined comment on Sunday.
There have been numerous incidents involving envelopes mailed with ricin to U.S. officials in recent years.
In 2018, a Utah man was indicted on charges of making ricin-related threats to President Donald Trump, FBI Director Christopher Wray and other federal officials, with all the letters ""containing castor bean material.""
Two people have been convicted and sentenced to prison in separate incidents of sending ricin-tainted letters to Barack Obama while he was president.

LA BOQUILLA DAM, Mexico (Reuters) - Protesters gathered on Sunday in drought-hit northern Mexico in an attempt to retain control of a dam key to government efforts to diffuse tensions over a water sharing pact with the United States.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has been working to maintain a good relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, said on Friday that Mexico has to comply with its obligations.
Under the 1944 treaty, Mexico must deliver 1,750,000 acre-feet of water to the United States over a five-year period. Mexico also gets U.S. water from the Colorado River.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott last week asked the State Department to help enforce the agreement. Mexico has until October 24 to meet a five year quota, and owes nearly a year supply of water, Abbott said.
Protesters took control of the La Boquilla dam in Chihuahua, which borders New Mexico, in September. A week ago, a protester was killed in gunfire from the Mexican National Guard after the early protest.
Anger boiled over amid plans to divert additional water at the dam due to obligations. 
Several protesters told Reuters the water is being ""stolen"" and that they had gathered because they worried the National Guard would recover control of the dam.
""We're here united to defend Chihuahua, defend the water they're stealing from us,"" said Marisa Flores, 60. ""This is the most critical time we've been living in Chihuahua.""
The National Water Commission of Mexico shows in its drought monitor that large parts of Chihuahua have suffered moderate and severe drought for more than six months. Neighboring states Sonora and Coahuila are also affected.
Along the U.S. border in Chihuahua state, several areas on the commission's drought monitor are marked as in severe drought. Much of the rest is marked as abnormally dry.

JERUSALEM/TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduras hopes to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv by the end of 2020, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, a move likely to anger the Palestinians. 
""To strengthen our strategic alliance, we spoke to arrange the opening of the embassies in Tegucigalpa and Jerusalem, respectively,"" Hernandez wrote on Twitter. ""We hope to take this historic step before the end of the year, as long as the pandemic allows it.""
The Central American nation has signalled in the past that it may move its embassy to Jerusalem. Netanyahu said the intention was to open and inaugurate their embassies before the end of the year. Israel currently has no embassy in Honduras but opened a diplomatic office there last month.
Only two countries - the United States and Guatemala - have already opened embassies in Jerusalem. The Honduran statement followed announcements by U.S. President Donald Trump and Netanyahu this month who said Kosovo and Serbia would also open embassies in Jerusalem.
The status of Jerusalem has been one of the thorniest issues in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as the capital of a future state. 
Israel regards all of the city, including the eastern sector it annexed after the 1967 war, as its capital. 
Last Tuesday, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed agreements in Washington to establish formal ties with Israel, a move forged partly through shared fears of Iran but one that could leave the Palestinians further isolated.

Trump hosted the White House ceremony, capping a month when first the UAE and then Bahrain agreed to reverse decades of ill will without a resolution of Israel's dispute with the Palestinians.

A Newspoll conducted for The Australian newspaper showed Morrison's performance rating rose a percentage point to 65% from a month earlier, just short of highs of 68% in June and July.
Morrison also recovered ground as the preferred prime minister after a dip in the previous poll, with the number of people supporting him nudging a point higher to 59%, the poll showed.
Steps taken by Australia's federal government have helped the country to record far fewer COVID-19 infections and deaths than many other developed countries, although the restrictions have taken a steep toll on the economy.
The government introduced a wage subsidy scheme and other initiatives to help protect jobs and support the economy, boosting Morrison's popularity.
The lift in ratings follows a decision last week to raise the number of citizens allowed to return home each week to 6,000, while a second wave of coronavirus infections in Victoria state has been easing.
The federal Liberal-National coalition remained ahead of the opposition Labor party on a two-party preferred basis, at 51% to 49%.
Australia has so far recorded a total of just over 26,900 novel coronavirus infections and 851 deaths, mainly in Victoria.

The poll was based on surveys of just over 2,000 voters across the capital cities of states and other regions from Wednesday to Saturday.

232,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2020 05:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. to slap sanctions on over two dozen targets tied to Iran arms,"By Steve Holland and Arshad Mohammed
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday will sanction more than two dozen people and entities involved in Iran's nuclear, missile and conventional arms programs, a senior U.S. official said, putting teeth behind U.N. sanctions on Tehran that Washington argues have resumed despite the opposition of allies and adversaries.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said Iran could have enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by the end of the year and that Tehran has resumed long-range missile cooperation with nuclear-armed North Korea. He did not provide detailed evidence regarding either assertion.
The new sanctions fit into U.S. President Donald Trump's effort to limit Iran's regional influence and come a week after U.S.-brokered deals for the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalize ties with Israel, pacts that may coalesce a wider coalition against Iran while appealing to pro-Israel U.S. voters ahead of the Nov. 3 election.
The new sanctions also put European allies, China and Russia on notice that while their inclination may be to ignore the U.S. drive to maintain the U.N. sanctions on Iran, companies based in their nations would feel the bite for violating them.
A major part of the new U.S. push is an executive order targeting those who buy or sell Iran conventional arms that was previously reported by Reuters and will also be unveiled by the Trump administration on Monday, the official said.
The Trump administration suspects Iran of seeking nuclear weapons - something Tehran denies - and Monday's punitive steps are the latest in a series seeking to stymie Iran's atomic program, which U.S. ally Israel views as an existential threat.
""Iran is clearly doing everything it can to keep in existence a virtual turnkey capability to get back into the weaponization business at a moment's notice should it choose to do so,"" the U.S. official told Reuters.
The official argued Iran wants a nuclear weapons capability and the means to deliver it despite the 2015 deal that sought to prevent this by restraining Iran's atomic program in return for access to the world market.
In May 2018, Trump abandoned that agreement to the dismay of the other parties - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - and restored U.S. sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy.
Iran, in turn, has gradually breached the central limits in that deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), including on the size of its stockpile of low-enriched uranium as well as the level of purity to which it was allowed to enrich uranium.
""Because of Iran's provocative nuclear escalation, it could have sufficient fissile material for a nuclear weapon by the end of this year,"" the official said without elaborating except to say this was based on ""the totality"" of information available to the United States, including from the IAEA.
The Vienna-based agency has said Iran only began significantly breaching the 2015 deal's limits after the U.S. withdrawal and it is still enriching uranium only up to 4.5%, well below the 20% it had achieved before that agreement, let alone the roughly 90% purity that is considered weapons-grade, suitable for an atomic bomb.
""Iran and North Korea have resumed cooperation on a long-range missile project, including the transfer of critical parts,"" he added, declining to say when such joint work first began, stopped, and then started again.
Asked to comment on the impending new U.S. sanctions and the U.S. official's other statements, a spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations dismissed them as propaganda and said they would further isolate the United States. 
""The U.S.' 'maximum pressure' show, which includes new propaganda measures almost every week, has clearly failed miserably, and announcing new measures will not change this fact,"" the mission's spokesman, Alireza Miryousefi, told Reuters in an email. 
""The entire world understands that these are a part of (the) next U.S. election campaign, and they are ignoring the U.S.' preposterous claims at the U.N. today. It will only make (the) U.S. more isolated in world affairs,"" he said.
The White House declined comment in advance of Monday's announcements.
'SNAP BACK' OF U.N. SANCTIONS?
The U.S. official confirmed Trump will issue an executive order that would allow the United States to punish those who buy or sell conventional arms to Iran with secondary sanctions, depriving them of access to the U.S. market. 
The proximate cause for this U.S. action is the impending expiration of a U.N. arms embargo on Iran and to warn foreign actors - U.S. entities are already barred from such trade - that if they buy or sell arms to Iran they will face U.S. sanctions.
Under the 2015 nuclear deal the U.N. conventional arms embargo is set to expire on Oct. 18.
The United States says it has triggered a ""snap back,"" or resumption, of virtually all U.N. sanctions on Iran, including the arms embargo, to come into effect at 8 p.m. on Saturday/0000 GMT on Sunday.
Other parties to the nuclear deal and most U.N. Security Council members have said they do not believe the United States has the right to reimpose the U.N. sanctions and that the U.S. move has no legal effect.
On Friday, Britain, France and Germany told the Security Council that U.N. sanctions relief for Iran - agreed under the 2015 nuclear deal - would continue beyond Sunday, despite Washington's assertion.
In letters to the Security Council on Saturday, China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun and Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia both described the U.S. move as ""illegitimate"" and said the U.N. sanctions relief for Iran would continue.
Also on Saturday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council he cannot act on the U.S. declaration that U.N. sanctions had been reimposed because it was not clear whether they had snapped back. 
""It is not for the Secretary-General to proceed as if no such uncertainty exists,"" he said.
TARGETS INCLUDE IRAN'S NUCLEAR, MISSILE, ARMS GROUPS
The new executive order will define conventional weapons broadly as any item with a potential military use, meaning it could cover such things as speed boats that Iran retrofits to harass vessels in international waters, the U.S. official told Reuters.
It would also apply to conventional circuit boards that can be used in ballistic missile guidance systems, he added.
The more than two dozen targets to be hit with sanctions on Monday include those involved in Iran's conventional arms, nuclear and missile programs, the official said, saying some of the targets are already sanctioned under other U.S. programs.
That could prompt criticism that the U.S. move is redundant and designed for public relations purposes to look tough on Iran, a charge critics have made about past U.S. sanctions actions.
Peter Harrell, a sanctions expert at the State Department under Democratic former President Barack Obama, called the U.S. steps ""a diplomatic and signaling exercise"" to show Trump cared about the issue but unlikely to deter potential arms deals.
""I don't think it's likely to change any behavior,"" he said, adding most players were likely to hold off until the Nov. 3 election to see if there is a change in U.S. administration. 
The U.S. official said among Monday's targets will be Iran's ""most nefarious arms organizations,"" about a dozen senior officials, scientists and experts from Iran's nuclear complex, members of a procurement network that supplies military-grade dual-use goods for Iran's missile program, and several senior officials involved in Iran's ballistic missile program.
The official declined to name the targets, saying this would be made public on Monday, and stressed that the United States wants to deter foreign companies from dealing with them even if their governments believe this is legally permitted.

""You might have a split in some countries where a foreign government may claim that the U.N. sanctions don't snap back but their banks and companies will abide by U.S. sanctions because they want to make sure they are not a future target,"" he said.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivory Coast's main presidential election challenger and a group of opposition parties called on Sunday for a civil disobedience campaign to stop President Alassane Ouattara's bid for a third term on Oct 31.
The election is seen as one of the biggest tests of the stability of the West African nation since a disputed election led to a brief civil war in 2010-11.
Ivory Coast's Constitutional Council has cleared Ouattara, former president Henri Konan Bedie and two other candidates to contest in the vote.
Bedie told a packed opposition PDCI party hall in Abidjan that the parties, after a meeting on Sunday, had come together to stop Ouattara's third term bid. 
""It is left to us, in light of everything that has been said here, to protect the stability of the nation,"" Bedie said, adding that in the face of Ouattara's persistence, there was only one slogan left, ""civil disobedience"".
At least a dozen people have been killed since anti-Ouattara riots broke out last month after he declared he would run following the sudden death of his handpicked successor in July.
The opposition has said that Ouattara, elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2015, is violating the constitution by seeking a third term. The 78-year old president says a constitutional change means his two-term limit has been reset. 
The outbreak of violence sparked memories of 2010-11, when 3,000 people died in the civil war in the country - the world's top producer of cocoa.
Several opposition party leaders took to the floor and backed the idea of trying to stop Ouattara running again, calling for demonstrations to be held across the country.
""The political parties are demanding the withdrawal of Alassane Ouattara's candidacy, the dissolution of the Constitutional Council, and the dissolution of the Electoral Commission, because of its subservience to the ruling RHDP party,"" said Saraka Patrice, an opposition party leader.

A spokesman for the Ivory Coast government was not immediately available for comment.

Sudan's transitional government, in charge since the toppling of Omar al-Bashir last year, has been pushing to get off the U.S. list, which hinders its ability to access foreign loans to tackle an economic crisis.
In August, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raised the issue of Sudan establishing ties with Israel during a visit. Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok told him he had no mandate to do so.
The UAE, a key partner of the U.S., and Bahrain have normalized ties with Israel in deals brokered by Washington, the first Arab states in a quarter of a century to break a longstanding taboo. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he expects other Arab countries to follow suit.
Ties with Israel are a sensitive issue in Sudan, which was among the hardline Muslim foes of Israel under Bashir.
The ruling council said its head, General Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan, and Justice Minister Nasredeen Abdelbari were in the delegation set to fly on Sunday to Abu Dhabi, where they would first meet UAE officials to discuss regional issues.
Afterwards Abdelbari will meet U.S. officials present in the UAE to discuss the ""removal of (the) name of Sudan from the list of states sponsoring terrorism, support of the transitional period and writing off American debts on Sudan"".
It gave no details. 
The authorities are under pressure to fix the economic crisis, which has worsened since Bashir's ouster. Inflation hit almost 170% last month, the currency has been in freefall and the government has declared an economic state of emergency.
In February, Burhan met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Uganda, a meeting condemned by Sudanese protesters. He afterwards cast doubt on any rapid normalisation of relations, though Israeli aircraft soon began overflying Sudan.

MADRID (Reuters) - Protesters in some poorer areas of Madrid that are facing lockdown to stem a soaring COVID-19 infection rate took to the streets on Sunday to call for better health provisions, complaining of discrimination by the authorities. 
Madrid's regional government on Friday ordered a lockdown from Monday in some of the poorer areas of the city and its outskirts that are home to about 850,000 people after a surge in coronavirus cases there. 
The lockdown measures predominantly apply to areas of lower income and with higher immigrant populations. Peaceful protests were held in 12 of the 37 districts affected on Sunday. 
About 600 people demonstrated in the southern district of Vallecas, which has one of the highest infection rates in the Spanish capital - about six times higher than that of Chamberi, a wealthy area in the north of the city, according to regional government figures.
Tensions rose as protesters at one stage threatened to gain access to the regional government building. 
""It is illogical that you can go and do things in wealthier areas, but you cannot do the same in Vallecas. There is the same risk of contagion. They are discriminating,"" said Begona Ramos, 56, a protester, who is self-employed and lives in Vallecas.
Demonstrators chanted, ""Vallecas is not a ghetto"".
They also called for the resignation of Madrid regional leader Isabel Diaz Ayuso, who attracted criticism for saying this week that ""the way of life of immigrants"" was partly to blame for the rise in cases.
Madrid mayor Jose Luis Martínez-Almeida said the measures did not discriminate against the poor. 
""There are no first class residents and second class residents. We have to be together at this moment,"" he tweeted. 
Authorities in Madrid, which accounts for a third of all infections in Spain, announced the restrictions in areas where the contagion levels exceed 1,000 per 100,000 inhabitants. 
In those areas access to parks and public areas will be restricted, gatherings will be limited to six people, and commercial establishments will have to close by 10 p.m. 
Police will set up 60 checkpoints to enforce the measures, but will not impose fines on the first day, regional authorities said on Sunday. Fines can vary between 600 euros and 600,000 euros, they said.
Regional justice chief Enrique Lopez condemned the demonstrations. 
""We are clear that these are the areas with the highest level of infection. To call protests right now when what we want is to avoid this seems absolutely irresponsible,"" he told Cadena Ser radio.
However, Madrid regional health chief Enrique Ruiz Escudero said if these measures did not reduce coronavirus cases, a city-wide lockdown could follow. 
""If it is necessary to shut down Madrid, we will do it,"" he said in an interview with ABC newspaper published on Sunday. 
Spain has the highest number of COVID-19 cases in western Europe, but Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez ruled out a second national lockdown in an interview with La Sexta TV on Saturday. 

Some 640,040 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Spain, health authorities said on Friday, with a rise of 4,697 in the past 24 hours. Nearly 30,500 people have died.

236,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>",Bahrain says it foils 'terrorist attack' backed by Iran - media,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain said on Sunday it had foiled a ""terrorist attack"" backed by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Saudi state television Al-Ekhbariya and a local Bahraini newspaper reported, both citing Bahrain's interior ministry.
Bahrain, host to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet and other international naval operations, has often accused Shi'ite Muslim Iran of seeking to subvert the kingdom, which has a Shi'ite majority and is ruled by Sunnis.
It was the only Gulf Arab state to witness a sizeable pro-democracy uprising in the 2011 ""Arab Spring"", from a largely Shi'ite opposition movement, which it quashed with Saudi and Emirati help.
Interior ministry investigations showed a new terrorist group called the ""Qassem Soleimani Brigade"" was planning to attack several public and security structures in Bahrain, the media reports said. 
The group also tracked several personal guards of ""important personalities"" in Bahrain as part of a plot to assassinate them, local newspaper Akhbar al-Khaleej said. 
The attacks were planned to avenge the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in January by a U.S. drone strike.
Bahrain's security forces said they foiled the planned attacks after finding an explosive device in the Badei area meant to target a visiting foreign delegation.
The media reports did not say when the attack was meant to have taken place, but said a case was being prepared against 18 accused, of which nine are now in Iran.
Bahrain joined the United Arab Emirates in establishing relations with Israel on Sept. 11, a move forged partly through shared fears of Iran. 
The deal has led to a surge in popular anger but analysts argue it strengthens the government, since traditional allies are more likely to turn a blind eye to any further crackdown.

Many walked in a vast column that stretched back several kilometres, decked out in red-and-white opposition colours and chanting ""go away"" as helmeted riot police patrolled the streets with water canons on hand, a witness said.
Several protesters were dragged away from the crowd by security forces. In the city centre, riot police rhythmically beat their shields as a warning sound while several people threw glass bottles at them. 
Videos shared by local media outlets showed security forces in helmets or masks hauling protesters off the streets in simultaneous protests in other cities.
The eastern European country was plunged into turmoil following a presidential election last month that Lukashenko says he won by a landslide but the opposition says was rigged.
In power for 26 years, the former Soviet collective farm manager has shown scant inclination to resign, buoyed by support from Russia.
The European Union vowed weeks ago to impose sanctions on Minsk for alleged election fraud and human rights abuses, but is likely to miss its own Monday deadline for action.
POLICE DATA LEAKED
In tandem with the protests, anonymous hackers leaked the personal data of 1,000 police officers in retaliation for a crackdown in which thousands of people have been detained, many complaining of beatings and torture in jail.
The government has denied abusing detainees.
The loyalty of the security forces is crucial to Lukashenko's ability to cling on to power. Their faces are often obscured by masks, balaclavas or riot helmets. Some protesters have torn the masks off some officers.
""As the arrests continue, we will continue to publish data on a massive scale,"" said a statement distributed by the opposition news channel Nexta Live on the messaging app Telegram. ""No one will remain anonymous even under a balaclava.""
The government said it would find and punish those responsible for leaking the data, which was widely distributed on Telegram channels on Saturday evening.
""The forces, means and technologies at the disposal of the internal affairs bodies make it possible to identify and prosecute the overwhelming majority of those guilty of leaking personal data on the Internet,"" said Olga Chemodanova, the spokeswoman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
STRATEGIC BUFFER
At least 80 people were detained across the country on Sunday, the human rights group Spring-96 said. 
The Russian news agency TASS said at least ten people had been held, citing police. The government typically releases the final figures the following day. 
Footage shared by Belarusian media outlets showed police dragging people from the front of a column of protesters who had linked arms in the western city of Brest, and firing spray from a bottle into the face of one of them. One security officer fired a warning shot into the air in a separate incident.
Metro stations were closed in central Minsk and the mobile internet disrupted for several hours. 
The government said 390 women were detained for taking part in a protest on Saturday. Most have been released.
Minsk reacted angrily on Saturday to reports that Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the leading opposition candidate in last month's election, could soon meet EU foreign ministers. 
Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also criticised the EU for inviting Tsikhanouskaya to the ministerial meeting as well as for considering sanctions against Minsk, saying Brussels was trying to ""rock the boat"" in Belarus.
Russia sees Belarus as a strategic buffer state against the EU and NATO, and has accused the United States of fomenting revolution in its neighbour.
Moscow agreed to give a $1.5 billion loan to prop up Lukashenko's government following a meeting between him and Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

Belarus will channel about $330 million of its new loan to cover its outstanding debt to Russian gas giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP), Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov was quoted by TASS as saying.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian opposition sources said Russian jets bombed rebel-held northwestern Syria on Sunday in the most extensive strikes since a Turkish-Russian deal halted major fighting with a ceasefire nearly six months ago.
Witnesses said the warplanes struck the western outskirts of Idlib city and that there was heavy artillery shelling in the mountainous Jabal al Zawya region in southern Idlib from nearby Syrian army outposts. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
""These 30 raids are by far the heaviest strikes so far since the ceasefire deal,"" said Mohammed Rasheed, a former rebel official and a volunteer plane spotter whose network covers the Russian air base in the western coastal province of Latakia.
Other tracking centres said Russian Sukhoi jets hit the Horsh area and Arab Said town, west of the city of Idlib. Unidentified drones also hit two rebel-held towns in the Sahel al-Ghab plain, west of Hama province.
There has been no wide-scale aerial bombing since a March agreement ended a Russian-backed bombing campaign that displaced over a million people in the region which borders Turkey after months of fighting.
There was no immediate comment from Moscow or the Syrian army who have long accused militant groups who hold sway in the last opposition redoubt of wrecking the ceasefire deal and attacking army-held areas.
The deal between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russia's President Vladimir Putin also defused a military confrontation between them after Ankara poured thousands of troops into Idlib province to hold back Russian-backed forces from new advances.
Western diplomats tracking Syria say Moscow piled pressure on Ankara in the latest round of talks on Wednesday to scale down its extensive military presence in Idlib. Turkey has more than ten thousand troops stationed in dozens of bases there, according to opposition sources in touch with Turkish military.
Witnesses say there has been a spike in sporadic shelling from Syrian army outposts against Turkish bases in the last two weeks. Rebels say the Syrian army and its allied militias were amassing troops on front lines.
Two witnesses said a Turkish military column comprising at least 15 armoured vehicles was seen overnight entering Syria through the Kafr Lusin border crossing in the direction of a main base in rural Idlib.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's top Christian cleric took a swipe at leaders of the Shi'ite Muslim community on Sunday for making demands he said were blocking the formation of a new government and causing political paralysis in a nation in deep crisis.
Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai, leader of the Maronite church, did not mention Shi'ites directly but asked how one sect can demand ""a certain ministry"". Shi'ite politicians say they must name the finance minister.
Sunday's sermon adds to tensions in a nation facing its worst crisis since a civil war ended in 1990 and where power is traditionally shared out between Muslims and Christians.
Responding to the patriarch without naming him, a Shi'ite religious council said comments by a ""major religious leader"" distorted the truth.
France has been pushing Lebanon to form a new cabinet fast. But a deadline of Sept. 15 that politicians told Paris they would meet has been missed amid a row over appointments, notably the finance minister, a post Shi'ites controlled for years.
Shi'ite politicians say they must choose some posts because rivals are trying to use ""foreign leverage"" to push them aside.
""In what capacity does a sect demand a certain ministry as if it is its own, and obstruct the formation of the government, until it achieves its goals, and so causes political paralysis?"" the patriarch of Lebanon's biggest Christian community said.
He said the Taif agreement, a pact that ended the 1975-1990 civil war, did not hand specific ministries to specific sects.
Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib, a Sunni, wants to appoint specialists and shake up the leadership of ministries.
The main Shi'ite groups - the Amal Movement and the heavily armed, Iranian-backed Hezbollah - want to pick figures for several posts, including the finance minister, a vital position as Lebanon navigates through its economic crisis.
In its statement directed at the patriarch, the Supreme Islamic Shi'ite Council said the sermon amounted to ""sectarian incitement that stirs up bigotry and distorts the facts"", the Lebanese broadcaster LBC reported.

A French roadmap for Lebanon includes the swift resumption of talks with the International Monetary Fund, as a first step for a new government to deal with a mountain of debt and fix the broken Lebanese banking sector.

The emergency has highlighted Europe's patchy response to a multi-year crisis that has seen more than a million migrants reach its shores, often on board flimsy vessels, after fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East and beyond.
After the fire in the Moria camp on the island of Lesbos on Sept. 9, Germany agreed to take in 1,553 migrants stranded on Greek islands. 
But the protesters in central Berlin wanted more action.
Wearing face masks in line with coronavirus regulations, around 5,000 people held up banners with slogans such as 'We have space! What else has to happen? Evacuate Moria Now!', 'Shame on you EU' and 'Shelters not Prisons'.
""I find it unacceptable that we live in one of the richest parts of the world and are somehow scared of 15,000 people and there is an eternal discussion about who will help these people,"" said demonstrator Oliver Bock. 
Despite deep divisions among members, the European Commission is due this week to put forward new proposals on migration. The bloc has failed to agree a common asylum policy five years after Merkel allowed 1.2 million people seeking protection into Germany.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told Bild am Sonntag weekly that he had high hopes. 

""I expect the EU Commission to come up with a solid proposal that pulls out all the stops so we have a political agreement on European asylum policy by the end of the year,"" Seehofer told the paper. He added that he expected no more than 100,000 migrants to arrive in Germany this year.

241,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2020 10:31AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Brazil's Lula says he will back anyone who can take on Bolsonaro,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, barred from elected office due to corruption convictions, said he is open to backing any candidate who can beat far-right President Jair Bolsonaro in the 2022 elections. 
""I am prepared to support any candidate who is committed to the working people of Brazil and against Bolsonaro,"" Lula told Reuters on Friday in an interview via video conference.
Whether or not he himself runs in the next general election, Lula said depends on the courts. The former president has two criminal convictions for graft that bar him from running unless he is able to overturn them, plus five other indictments.
The charismatic former leader said his Workers Party, known as the PT, will support left and center-left parties in the November local elections to build opposition to Bolsonaro, who he accused of failing to lead Brazil out of its worst economic and public health crisis in the coronavirus pandemic.
Still one of Brazil's most popular politicians, Lula - who governed Brazil from 2003-2010 - maintains that the corruption cases against him were politically motivated to stop him returning to power and said he hopes the graft sentences can be annulled by the courts as new evidence of bias by prosecutors emerges.
Lula is sure of his place in the history books for lifting millions out of poverty and he said there was no need for a mea culpa for misdeeds committed by his party.
""We did not do everything we should have done, but never before has a government done so much for social inclusion taking care of the poor, Blacks and indigenous people,"" he said.
If Lula were free to run and the election held today, he would tie with Bolsonaro in a run-off, a poll by Poder360 news portal found last week.
The survey showed Lula was favored by women, blue-collar workers, young and older and university-educated voters, while Bolsonaro would win farm-belt states, the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and even the northeast, once a Lula stronghold but where Bolsonaro has made inroads with payments to families during the pandemic.
NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION
Lula, who will be 75 next month, left quarantine in his home in an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo on Thursday for the first times since March 12 to do routine medical exams that found him in good health.
""I did all the exams for someone who wants to live to 120 and everything is marvelous. I have the energy of a 30-year-old and the political drive of a 20-year-old,"" he joked.
On Monday, his party will launch a National Reconstruction Plan that will propose recovering Latin America's largest economy from its worst slump with strong industrial investments and the creation of a new social welfare program that will guarantee low-income families a 600 reais a month stipend.
Lula was jailed in 2018 and spent 560 days behind bars until he was freed in November last year after the Supreme Court reversed a previous ruling on whether defendants should be imprisoned or not before all their appeals are exhausted. He faces six other corruption indictments.
""I am absolutely convinced of my innocence. They banned me because they knew I was going to win again,"" he said.
Candidate or not, Lula plans to lead his party and start traveling up and down Brazil as soon as the pandemic abates. 
What he says he wants most is to be judged not by the courts but by voters in an election where his party will run against Bolsonaro on its legacy of raising the quality of life of poor Brazilians, especially in the northeast of Brazil, his homeland.

""We did away with hunger and there is hunger again in Brazil,"" he said.

""America is approaching a certain defeat in its sanctions move ... It faced defeat and negative response from the international community,"" Rouhani said in a televised speech.
""We will never yield to U.S. pressure and Iran will give a crushing response to America's bullying,"" he said.
The Iranian rial fell to a record low against the U.S. dollar on Sunday following the Trump administration's declaration.
The U.S. currency was offered for as much as 273,000 rials, up from 267,800 rials on Saturday, according to foreign exchange site Bonbast.com, which tracks the unofficial market. 
Iran has dismissed the U.S. sanctions move as ""void and illegal"" and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council on Saturday he cannot take any action on the U.S. declaration because ""there would appear to be uncertainty"" on the issue.
The three European parties to the nuclear deal - France, Britain and Germany - said in a statement on Sunday that any decision or action taken to reimpose U.N. sanctions ""would be incapable of legal effect"" because Washington used a mechanism agreed under a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which the United States quit in 2018.
However, Trump plans to issue an executive order allowing him to impose U.S. sanctions on anyone violating sanctions against Iran. 
The Iranian foreign ministry described Washington's efforts as ""futile"", adding that ""the U.S. approach is a major threat to the international peace and security and an unprecedented threat to the U.N. and the Security Council"". 
“Iran emphasizes that if the U.S., directly or with the cooperation of a number of its allies, makes any move in line with these threats, it will face a serious reaction and should account for all its dangerous consequences,” the ministry said in a statement, without elaborating. 
Washington has unilaterally reimposed sanctions on Iran since 2018, which combined with a drop in oil prices have crippled the economy in Iran, which also has the highest COVID-19 death toll in the Middle East with 24,301 deaths. 

Iran's rial has lost about 75% of its value since 2018.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Openly challenging the monarchy of Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn, thousands of protesters marched in Bangkok on Sunday to present demands that include a call for reforms to curb his powers.
Protesters have grown ever bolder during two months of demonstrations against Thailand's palace and military-dominated establishment, breaking a longstanding taboo on criticising the monarchy - which is illegal under lese majeste laws.
The Royal Palace was not immediately available for comment. The king, who spends much of his time in Europe, is not in Thailand now.
The marchers were blocked by hundreds of unarmed police manning crowd control barriers.
Protest leaders declared victory after handing police a letter detailing their demands. Phakphong Phongphetra, head of the Metropolitan Police Bureau, said the letter would be handed to police headquarters to decide how to proceed.
""Our greatest victory in the two days is showing that ordinary people like us can send a letter to royals,"" Parit ""Penguin"" Chiwarak, told the crowd before it dispersed. 
At the biggest demonstration in years, tens of thousands of protesters on Saturday cheered calls for reform of the monarchy as well as for the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and a new constitution and elections.
Shortly after sunrise on Sunday, protesters cemented a plaque near the Grand Palace in Bangkok in the area known as Sanam Luang, or Royal Field.
It reads, ""At this place the people have expressed their will: that this country belongs to the people and is not the property of the monarch as they have deceived us"".
Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said police would not use violence against protesters and it was up to the police to determine and prosecute any illegal speech. 
Bangkok authorities would need to determine whether the plaque was illegal, and if it was it would be removed, Bangkok's deputy police chief Piya Tawichai told reporters.
After the protest, people queued up to take pictures next to the plaque, which also features a hand giving the three-finger salute adopted by pro-democracy protesters.
DIVISION
But far from all Thais support the new plaque, which resembles one that had commemorated the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 and which was removed from outside a royal palace in 2017, after Vajiralongkorn took the throne.
Prominent right-wing politician Warong Dechgitvigrom said the actions of the protesters were inappropriate and that the king was above politics.
""It didn't achieve anything,"" he told Reuters. ""These actions are symbolically against the king, but the king is not an opponent."" 
Thai authorities have said criticising the monarchy is unacceptable in a country where the king is constitutionally ""enthroned in a position of revered worship"".
Protests that began on university campuses have drawn increasing numbers of older people. That includes ""red shirt"" followers of ousted populist Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra who had clashed for years with pro-establishment ""yellow shirts"" before Prayuth seized power in 2014.
""The new generation is achieving what their parents and grandparents didn't dare. I'm very proud of that,"" said Somporn Outsa, 50, a red shirt veteran. ""We still respect the monarchy, but it should be under the constitution.""
Protesters say the constitution gives the king too much power and that it was engineered to allow Prayuth to keep power after elections last year. He says that vote was fair.
The next protest is scheduled for Thursday. Protest leaders called on Thais to take Oct. 14 off work to show their support for change.

Other measures they sought for were for people to withdraw deposits from Siam Commercial Bank (BK:SCB), in which the king's Crown Property Bureau owns more than 23% of the shares, and to stop standing for the royal anthem in cinemas.

The NATO members and neighbours have been locked in a bitter dispute over the extent of their continental shelves in the eastern Mediterranean. Tensions flared last month when Turkey sent a vessel to survey for gas and oil in contested waters.
European Union member Greece condemned the move as illegal and pressed, along with Cyprus, for a strong response from EU leaders when they meet on Thursday. 
Ankara withdrew the Oruc Reis vessel last week. It described the move as a routine maintenance stop but later said it opened up the chance for diplomacy to reduce tensions with Athens.
""At this point, the climate has become much more suitable for negotiations to begin,"" presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told Dogan News Agency. ""...Exploratory talks may start again.""
Last month Greece and Turkey were on the verge of resuming those ""exploratory"" talks, suspended in 2016. But Turkey broke off contact and sent Oruc Reis into disputed waters after Greece signed a maritime demarcation deal with Egypt, angering Ankara.

SANCTIONS THREATS
Erdogan has had talks with EU Council president Charles Michel, who chairs the meetings of EU leaders, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is seeking to ease the crisis.
But Cyprus, protesting the presence of two Turkish exploration vessels in waters off the divided island, insists on sanctions against Ankara and has blocked EU action against Belarus for alleged election fraud until its demands are met.
""Threats of blackmail and of sanctions against Turkey does not give results,"" Kalin said. ""European politicians should know this by now.""
Erdogan tweeted at the weekend that Turkey believed the dispute could be resolved through dialogue while still defending its rights in the region. 
""We want to give diplomacy as much space as possible, by listening to every sincere call,"" he tweeted. ""With this vision, we will continue to defend any drop of water and area of our country to the end.""

ROME (Reuters) - Italians began voting on Sunday in a raft of local ballots and a referendum, with the ruling coalition under pressure in its first electoral test since the coronavirus crisis.
Voters have largely approved of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's handling of the pandemic, but recent opinion polls suggest this will not help his coalition allies in the vote for the heads of seven regions and mayors in almost 1,000 towns.
The rightist opposition, led by Matteo Salvini's League, is expected to win at least four of the regions up for grabs, and could capture the traditional leftwing stronghold of Tuscany.
A drubbing for the ruling parties would galvanise the League and its allies, but most analysts say it would be unlikely to trigger a government collapse in the midst of the coronavirus crisis and as the country prepares a crucial 2021 budget. 
Voting takes place over two days and exit polls will be published at 1300 GMT on Monday when ballot boxes close.
The co-ruling anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and centre-left Democratic Party are fielding separate candidates almost everywhere, hurting their chances against a united centre-right. 
5-Star, which does not run any of Italy's 20 regions, is pinning its hopes on the only nationwide ballot -- a referendum it champions to cut the number of lawmakers to 600 from 945. 
Early voting went smoothly despite concerns over possible delays due to coronavirus social distancing rules.
""The polling station president and the staff were very clear about the rules. It took 15 seconds longer to vote perhaps, but everything was fine,"" said 69-year-old university professor Carlo Di Giovine after voting in the referendum in Rome.
The centre-left is expected to lose control of Marche in the centre and Puglia in the south, while holding on to the southern region of Campania. Tuscany looks like a neck-and-neck race.

The right should easily keep power in the two northern regions where it currently governs -- Liguria and Veneto. The seventh region at stake is the tiny, French-speaking Valle D'Aosta which has its own party system.

Ianos uprooted trees and caused power cuts on the Ionian islands and the western Peloponnese. It swept through central Greece on Saturday, hitting the cities of Karditsa and Farsala before it moved south to the island of Crete.
The body of a man was found under the collapsed roof of his house in a village near Karditsa on Sunday, the Athens News Agency said. On Saturday, a 63-year-old man was found dead in the same area and the body of an elderly woman was found in nearby Farsala, fire brigade officials said.
Authorities were still searching for a woman reported missing in Karditsa, the official said. 
The heavy rainfall on Saturday turned Karditsa, in one of Greece's biggest plains, into a lake. Video footage showed flooded highways, collapsed bridges and agricultural land turned into mud lakes with farmers carrying their sheep to rescue.
A river flooded its banks and damaged roads and a medical centre in the town of Mouzaki.
Experts estimate that about 5,000 houses were flooded in the area of Karditsa. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who is expected to visit the region in the coming days, said the government will provide economic relief to the affected areas.
By Saturday night, the storm had reached Crete, where heavy rainfall flooded streets and shops.
The fire brigade said it had received more than 2,450 calls in the affected regions for assistance to rescue trapped people, cut down trees, and pump out water from homes and businesses. 

Cyclones were first recorded in Greece in 1995 and have become more frequent in recent years. A similar storm hit the country in 2018. Flash floods in 2017 killed 25 people and left hundreds homeless.

The U.S. social media giant last week said that the Irish Data Protection Commission, its lead EU regulator, had made a preliminary decision that the mechanism it uses to transfer data from the EU to the United States ""cannot in practice be used"".
Facebook requested and secured a temporary freeze on the order and a court review in the Irish High Court, which is due to consider the issue in November.
In an affidavit submitted to the court to request that the order be frozen, Yvonne Cunnane, Facebook Ireland's head of data protection and associate general counsel, said it was not clear how the company could continue providing services in the EU if the Irish order is enforced, the Sunday Business Post reported.
""It is not clear to (Facebook) how, in those circumstances, it could continue to provide the Facebook and Instagram services in the EU,"" the newspaper quoted the affidavit as saying. 
The affidavit has not been made public, a High Court spokesman said, and a Facebook spokeswoman did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. 
In a Sept. 9 blog post that first confirmed the investigation by the Irish regulator, Facebook said it ""relied on the mechanism in question - under what are known as standard contractual clauses (SCCs) - to transfer data to countries outside the EU and that a ban would have ""a far reaching effect on businesses that rely on SCCs"". 
The Irish investigation follows a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union in July on when SCCs can be used legally. 

The ruling was in response to EU concerns that the surveillance regime in the United States might not respect the privacy rights of EU citizens when their personal data is sent to the United States for commercial use.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council on Saturday he cannot take any action on a U.S. declaration that all U.N. sanctions on Iran had been reimposed because ""there would appear to be uncertainty"" on the issue. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month that he triggered a 30-day process at the council leading to the return of U.N. sanctions on Iran on Saturday evening that would also stop a conventional arms embargo on Tehran from expiring on Oct. 18.
But 13 of the 15 Security Council members say Washington's move is void because Pompeo used a mechanism agreed under a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which the United States quit in 2018.
""There would appear to be uncertainty whether or not the process ... was indeed initiated and concomitantly whether or not the (sanctions) terminations ... continue in effect,"" Guterres wrote in a letter to the council, seen by Reuters. 
""It is not for the Secretary-General to proceed as if no such uncertainty exists,"" he said. 
U.N. officials provide administrative and technical support to the Security Council to implement its sanctions regimes and Guterres appoints independent experts to monitor implementation. He said that ""pending clarification"" of the status of the Iran sanctions, he would not take any action to provide that support. 
Washington argues it triggered the return of sanctions - known as ""snapback"" - because a U.N. resolution that enshrines the pact still names it as a participant. Diplomats say few countries are likely to reimpose the measures lifted under the 2015 deal that aimed to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. 
""If U.N. Member States fail to fulfill their obligations to implement these sanctions, the United States is prepared to use our domestic authorities to impose consequences for those failures,"" Pompeo said in a statement on Saturday.
He said that in the coming days Washington would announce additional measures to strengthen the implementation of the U.N. sanctions and ""hold violators accountable."" The United States is trying to push Iran to negotiate a new deal with Washington. 
Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy responded on Twitter, ""We all clearly said in August that U.S. claims to trigger snapback are illegitimate. Is Washington deaf?""
Longtime U.S. allies Britain, France and Germany told the council on Friday that U.N. sanctions relief for Iran would continue and that any decision or action taken to reimpose U.N. sanctions ""would be incapable of legal effect.""
Iran's U.N. Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi said on Twitter on Saturday, ""U.S. illegal and false 'deadline' has come and gone ... Swimming against international currents will only bring it more isolation.""

The 12 were arrested on Aug. 23 for illegal entry into mainland Chinese waters after setting off from Hong Kong in a boat bound for self-ruled Taiwan.
All were suspected of committing crimes in Hong Kong related to the anti-government protests that erupted last year. Ten had been charged, released on bail and not allowed to leave the former British colony, and all are now being detained in neighboring Shenzhen.
Relatives of some of the detainees held a news conference outside the Hong Kong police headquarters on Sunday to express their frustration with local authorities.
""We want our son back...even though we can't visit him, at least give us a letter from him to confirm that he's there,"" the father of one detainee, Li Tsz Yin, said.
The Hong Kong government and the police did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. 
The relatives also asked police ""to give an account of the date, time, place and process of the arrest"" and whether there were any injuries or casualties, and the Marine Department to release radar records of the day of the arrest.
They said the government ""only shirked responsibility and confused the public with mere excuses.""
""However, up to now, the lawyers appointed by the families have been refused to meet with the detainees. In other words, the conditions of the so-called arrested persons are still known only to the Chinese authorities,"" a statement said.
On Tuesday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam voiced discontent with the group being characterised by some as ""democratic activists being oppressed"", saying they were running away from the law. Lam said they would have to be ""dealt with"" by mainland authorities, but pledged to provide ""feasible"" assistance.

Police in Shenzhen said last Sunday they were suspected of illegal entry, their first public comment on the matter. The same day, China's foreign ministry labelled the group as ""separatists"".

State news agency SPA quoted a civil defence spokesman as saying three cars were damaged in the border village and that the five civilians suffered minor injuries from shrapnel.
There was no confirmation of the attack by the Houthi group, which has been battling a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen for more than five years. The group has fired missiles and drones towards Saudi cities, most of which have been intercepted.
The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed government from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014.

Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, has close cultural and historic ties with Japan, though Japan, like most countries, recognises China's government in Beijing, not Taiwan's.
Meeting Tsai in Taipei on Friday, former Japanese prime minister Yoshiro Mori, visiting for a memorial service for late president Lee Teng-hui, said Suga told him that ""if there is the opportunity, he hopes to speak by phone or other means"".
China's foreign ministry said late on Saturday that Japan had told them such a thing ""will never happen"", after Beijing sought clarification from Tokyo.
Tsai told reporters that she did not talk about this issue with Mori. ""We also don't have this plan at the moment to have a telephone conversation,"" she said.
A spokesman for Japan's foreign ministry echoed Tsai's comments, saying ""there is no plan for a telephone call"" between the two leaders. 
Japan's foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment outside of usual working hours on Sunday.
Japan cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of China in 1972.
Taiwan was a Japanese colony between 1895 and 1945.

Unlike in China or South Korea, many Taiwanese have a broadly positive view of Japan, saying that Japan's rule brought progress to what was an undeveloped, largely agricultural island.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - The last two days of Chinese aircraft approaching Taiwan demonstrate that Beijing is a threat to the entire region and have shown Taiwanese even more clearly the true nature of China's government, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Sunday.
Multiple Chinese aircraft flew across the mid line of the Taiwan Strait and into Taiwan's air defence identification zone on Friday and Saturday, causing Taiwan to scramble jets to intercept. China claims Taiwan as its own territory.
At a news conference in Beijing on Friday about China's U.N. peacekeeping efforts, China announced combat drills near the Taiwan Strait and denounced what it called collusion between the island and the United States.
The exercises took place as U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach was in Taipei, the most senior State Department office to come in four decades. 
Speaking to reporters, Tsai denounced China's drills.
""I believe these activities are no help to China's international image, and what's more have put Taiwan's people even more on their guard, understanding even better the true nature of the Chinese Communist regime,"" she said.
""Additionally, other countries in the region also have a better understanding of the threat posed by China,"" Tsai added. ""The Chinese Communists must restrain themselves, and not provoke.""
China's air force on Saturday put out a video showing its nuclear capable H-6 bombers, which have been involved in many Chinese fly-bys of Taiwan, exercising.
One montage shows a simulation of an H-6 attack against an air base which appears by its runway layout to be the main U.S. air force base on Guam.
Asked about that footage, and China's decision to release it while Krach was in Taiwan, Tsai said China's recent activities where a threat broader than just to Taiwan.
""China's existence is indeed aggressive and will bring a definite threat.""
In comments carried by Chinese state media from a forum on relations with Taiwan in the southeastern Chinese city of Xiamen, the head of China's Taiwan Affairs Office on Sunday made no direct mention of the current tensions.
Meeting young Taiwanese, Liu Jieyi said it was inevitable that the two sides would grow closer.
""Only when cross-strait relations are good can the interests and well-being of Taiwan compatriots be fundamentally guaranteed,"" Liu said.
But further friction seems likely as Taiwan and the United States further deepen relations, with Taiwan angling for a free trade agreement.

Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said on Sunday they were planning to hold a formal economic dialogue with the United States, after having what she called informal talks with Krach and his team on issues like supply chain restructuring.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean police said on Sunday they had arrested a defector who tried to return to North Korea after a similar, successful crossing in July escalated tensions on the peninsula.
The defector, who had fled to South Korea in 2018, was suspected of breaking into a military training site in South Korea's border town of Cheorwon on Thursday to head back to North Korea.
""The man is under police investigation. We are looking into details such as why he tried to cross the border,"" a policewomen said by telephone. She said she could not confirm the date of the arrest.
In July, a 24-year-old defector returned to North Korea the way he left in 2017, going through a drainage ditch and swimming across the Han River to the North.
When the 24-year-old defector illegally returned to North Korea in July, the ""runaway"" prompted the government to launch an investigation into the military unit responsible for the crossing.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia looked set to record its lowest daily increase in new coronavirus cases in three months on Sunday as a hard lockdown in the city of Melbourne brought the country's virus epicenter down sharply.
The second-most populous state Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, reported 14 new infections in the 24 hours to Sunday morning, down from 21 new cases the day prior and its lowest since June 19.
That put Victoria, which has spent months under lockdown to slow a second wave of infections, on track to meet a target of keeping average daily increases below 50 by Sept. 28 when the authorities have said they may lift restrictions.
Australia's biggest state New South Wales, which has Sydney as the capital, reported two new cases, while the Queensland state also reported two, bringing the national total to 18, the lowest national tally since June 23. The five other states and territories had not reported daily case numbers by Sunday morning, but have reported no increases most days for weeks.
""There will of course always be debates about timing and whether we're on schedule, ahead of schedule, all of those things, (but) ultimately these numbers are cause for great optimism and positivity,"" Victorian state Premier Daniel Andrews told a televised news conference.
Andrews, who has faced political pressure domestically for his hard-line approach to enforcing restrictions of movement, invoked recent spikes in infection rates in Europe as a warning about the possible effect of exiting the lockdown too soon.
""It's heartbreaking to see, all that those communities have given, all the sacrifice that they've made, and now they've got cases running perhaps more wildly than their first wave,"" he said. ""You've got to see it off.""
Melbourne has been under one of the toughest lockdowns in the world, including a nightly curfew, after a second outbreak in that state saw daily infection rates over 700 and prompted other states to close internal borders.
Victoria also recorded five additional deaths associated with the virus and NSW reported one new death in the prior 24 hours, taking the national death toll to 850, according to government data.

The country has reported just under 26,900 infections.

In a statement, Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF) said it disagreed with the decision by a local judge to unfreeze Libre Abordo's bank accounts and said it had filed an appeal.
Libre Abordo and its related company Schlager Business Group threw a lifeline to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro late last year by signing a deal to trade its crude and fuel in return for Mexican corn and water trucks. 
The companies said the oil-for-food deal did not violate U.S. sanctions imposed on PDVSA in January 2019. 
However, the U.S. Treasury blacklisted both companies in June, accusing them of helping Maduro's administration evade sanctions. The UIF, part of Mexico's finance ministry, said the following day it had frozen the bank accounts of both companies.
Libre Abordo and Schlager declined to comment. The court did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""The UIF demonstrated to the court that the accounts were blocked due to a request for international assistance, cooperation and collaboration made by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Treasury,"" the agency said, adding the judge's ruling contravened Mexico's international commitments.
In June, Libre Abordo said it would ask lawyers to evaluate a decision by the U.S. Treasury Department, which sanctioned it for trading millions of barrels of Venezuelan crude and fuel.
Libre Abordo said U.S. sanctions are wrongly linking the company to unrelated entities under sanctions.
Libre Abordo said in May it was declaring bankruptcy after what it said were losses of $90 million amid what it called ""excessive"" U.S. pressure. The trade with Venezuela was suspended, the company said.

WASHINGTON/OTTAWA (Reuters) - An envelope addressed to the White House and intercepted by U.S. authorities contained a substance identified as ricin, a deadly poison that appeared to have been sent from Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said on Saturday.
An RCMP spokesman confirmed ""it has received a request for assistance from the FBI in connection with a suspicious letter sent to the White House.""
The RCMP added ""the FBI conducted an analysis on the substance found in the envelope. This report indicated the presence of ricin, a toxic substance."" RCMP said it working with the FBI but declined to discuss further details.
The envelope was intercepted at a government mail center before it arrived at the White House.
Asked about the reports, the FBI said the agency and ""U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Postal Inspection Service partners are investigating a suspicious letter received at a U.S. government mail facility. At this time, there is no known threat to public safety."" 
The White House and U.S. Secret Service declined to comment.
Ricin is found naturally in castor beans but it takes a deliberate act to convert it into a biological weapon. Ricin can cause death within 36 to 72 hours from exposure to an amount as small as a pinhead. No known antidote exists.
There have been numerous incidents involving envelopes mailed with ricin to U.S. officials.
In 2018, a Utah man, William Clyde Allen III, was indicted for making ricin-related threats, including mailing a threat against Trump and other federal officials including FBI Director Christopher Wray, with all the letters ""containing castor bean material."" Allen remains in custody.
Two people were convicted in separate incidents of sending ricin-tainted letters to then-President Barack Obama.
In May 2014, a Mississippi man, James Everett Dutschke, was sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to sending letters with the deadly substance to Obama, as well as a U.S. senator and a state judge.

In July 2014, a Texas actor was sentenced to 18 years for mailing letters containing ricin to Obama and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The fire that broke out in Moria on Sept. 9 left over 12,000 people, most of them refugees from Afghanistan, Syria and various African countries, without shelter, proper sanitation or access to food and water. No one was hurt in the blaze.
About 9,000 people had been resettled in the new tent camp, set up by authorities at Kara Tepe near the port of Mytilene, by Saturday morning. A few hundred had also moved into a community centre managed by a non-governmental organisation. 
Those entering the camp were being registered and tested for COVID-19. At least 214 were placed in quarantine after positive tests. 
Traffic was returning to normal on the roads, where thousands of migrants had camped for days after the fire, and stores in the area started reopening. 
Greek police launched an operation on Thursday to speed up the resettlement of migrants. Many had been reluctant to enter the temporary camp as they had hoped to leave Lesbos after the fire and reach other European countries.

Authorities believe the fire that gutted the notorious for its living conditions Moria camp was started by migrants following a dispute over COVID-19 quarantine measures at the facility after dozens of asylum-seekers tested positive. Six people have been arrested and charged with arson.

The weather shift, which followed intermittently heavy showers on Friday, helped more than 9,000 personnel fight 29 wildfires across Washington and Oregon, including the Riverside Fire southeast of Portland, the U.S. Forestry Service said.
Firefighters can expect another 2 to 4 inches of rain in the next week for coastal Oregon and parts of the Cascade Mountains, said David Roth, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park Maryland.
""That'll be over the next three to seven days, which should at least help,"" Roth said. ""Something is better than nothing.""
But even after the rainfall west of the Cascade Mountains, the fire was still feeding on deep layers of long-dead vegetation that is abundant in the western wilderness, a fire report read. 
""Rain doesn’t do much to put out the fire unless we get a lot of it,"" Incident Commander Alan Sinclair said in a statement. ""But the good news is the cool, damp weather is moderating fire activity and giving us a chance to make progress in containment efforts.""
The Riverside Fire has burned nearly 138,000 acres (55,847 hectares) and is only 11% contained, 
The unusually ferocious wildfires have claimed at least eight lives in Oregon and one in Washington state, blackening 1.7 million acres (650,000 hectares) in the two states since Labor Day and incinerating several small towns.
Oregon emergency management officials have warned the death toll there could climb as search teams scour the ruins of thousands of homes engulfed in flames during chaotic evacuations early in the disaster.
Thousands of evacuees, particularly in Oregon, have been forced into emergency shelters, mobile trailers and hotel rooms. 
To the south, flames have charred a record 3.5 million acres (1.3 million hectares) in California, killing 26 people and destroying more than 5,800 structures since mid-August, the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said.
A force of more than 19,000 firefighters made headway against the 27 major blazes they have been battling since August as searing temperatures diminished somewhat, Cal Fire said.
But at least one blaze, the Bobcat Fire in the San Gabriel Mountains northeast of Los Angeles, spread rapidly in high winds leaving more than 91,000 acres (36,826 hectares) scorched, it said. The cause of the fire, which has containment lines set up only on 15% of its perimeter, is being investigated, it added.
Winds remain a threat, with forecasts calling for gusts up to 25 mph (40 kph) amid very low humidity, it said.
Roth, at the Weather Prediction Center, said that there is almost no rain in sight for California.
""There's very little for California, maybe some in the far north near the Oregon border,"" he said. 

Despite the moderating temperatures in the south, weather in the northern part of the state is forecast to return to a warm, dry pattern, and warming conditions throughout the state early next week are expected to bring elevated fire danger, it said.

Separately the chief of the elite Revolutionary Guards rejected as a ""bluff"" any possibility of a military conflict with the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump plans to issue an executive order allowing him to impose U.S. sanctions on anyone violating an arms embargo against Iran, which is set to expire in October, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The Trump administration says that on Saturday all United Nations sanctions on Iran have to be restored and the conventional arms embargo will no longer expire in mid-October.
""The Americans as a rule act as a bully and impose sanction... The world community should decide how to act towards bullying,"" Zarif told Iranian state television hours before the U.S. move aiming to restore U.N. sanctions against Iran.
""As they (other countries) will face the same thing tomorrow when America takes the same action towards the Nord Stream project, as well as other projects because a bully will continue to act as a bully if he is allowed to do it once,"" Zarif said. 
The United States and many European countries oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which they say will increase Europe’s reliance on Russian gas.
""No power, including the United States, has the conditions to impose a new war on the Iranian nation, so people should not worry about these exaggerated bluffs by the U.S. president,"" said Revolutionary Guards Commander Hossein Salami, quoted by the semi-official news agency ISNA.
Salami was apparently reacting to a tweet by Trump this week in which he said any Iranian attack against the United States would be met by a response ""1,000 times greater in magnitude.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Susan Collins said on Saturday the U.S. Senate should not fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court until after the Nov. 3 presidential election, and the winner of that race should pick the nominee.
Collins, who is in a tough re-election battle in Maine, said in a statement that ""in fairness to the American people, who will either be re-electing the president or selecting a new one, the decision on a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court should be made by the president who is elected on November 3."" 
Collins is the first Republican senator to suggest the nomination should be tied to who wins the White House. 
Republicans control the Senate with a 53-47 majority. 
Senator Lisa Murkowsi, an Alaska Republican, told Alaska Public Radio in an interview shortly before the announcement of Ginsburg's death that she would not vote to confirm a nominee before the election. Murkowski's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. 

About seven Republican incumbents and two Democrats face a chance of losing their seats in November's election, according to nonpartisan election trackers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has raised the stakes in the struggle for control of the U.S. Senate, forcing embattled Republican incumbents to choose between trying to appeal to moderate voters or hoping to fire up a conservative base.
President Donald Trump on Saturday said he would quickly nominate a successor to the liberal icon. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised a vote, giving the pair a chance to cement a 6-3 conservative majority on the court while their party holds both the White House and a 53-47 Senate majority.
That would raise the chances of the court overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, placing one of the most heated social and political battles in the United States front and center on the campaign trail.
With the court vacancy coming so near the Nov. 3 presidential and congressional elections, Democrats argue that the voters should weigh in before Trump and McConnell rush to fill the seat -- the very argument McConnell employed in 2016 to block a nominee of President Barack Obama's.
""There are those people who have a hypocrisy meter and it just offends them,"" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, referring to Republicans' changing strategies.
Polls show Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden leading Trump ahead of the November election, and also give Democrats a chance of unseating enough Republican senators to capture a majority in that chamber.
Now, multiple incumbent Republican senators face the choice of backing Trump's eventual court nominee and potentially losing some moderate voters, or rejecting that person and angering the conservative base.
About seven Republican incumbents and two Democrats face a chance of losing their seats in November's election, according to nonpartisan election trackers. Democrats would need a net gain of three seats for a majority if presidential nominee Joe Biden unseats Trump, meaning a Vice President Kamala Harris would be on hand to break 50-50 ties in the Senate.
One of the most threatened Senate Republicans, Maine's Susan Collins, on Saturday said the Senate should hold off approving a nominee.
""In fairness to the American people, who will either be re-electing the President or selecting a new one, the decision on a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court should be made by the President who is elected on November 3rd,"" Collins said on Twitter.
Colorado's Cory Gardner issued a statement offering warm words about Ginsburg's memory while making no mention of the looming political fight.
""This is an enormous political conundrum,"" said Paul Sracic, a political science professor at Youngstown State University in Ohio. ""You're going to lose someone in this,"" referring to segments of senators' home-state voters.
Collins and Gardner did not respond to requests for comment.
Adding to the pressure will be independent-leaning Republican Senators Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski, neither a vocal Trump backer. If that pair voted against a Trump pick, McConnell would be left with a one-vote margin.
Neither Romney nor Murkowski commented publicly on their intentions following Ginsburg's death, though Murkowski has previously indicated she would be inclined not to back any Supreme Court nominee in the final weeks before an election. Neither responded to requests for comment.
Other Republicans in competitive races saw the chance to vote for Trump's third Supreme Court appointee as a winning issue.
""There is a clear choice on the future of the Supreme Court between the well-qualified and conservative jurist President Trump will nominate and I will support, and the liberal activist Joe Biden will nominate,"" North Carolina's Thom Tillis said in a statement.
Republican Representative Doug Collins, who hopes to win a promotion to the Senate on Nov. 3, tweeted late on Friday upon hearing of Ginsburg's death.
""RIP to the more than 30 million innocent babies that have been murdered during the decades that Ruth Bader Ginsburg defended pro-abortion laws,"" Collins said. ""With @realDonaldTrump nominating a replacement that values human life, generations of unborn children have a chance to live.""
One senior Senate Republican, who asked not to be identified, said on Saturday the prospect of solidifying a conservative Supreme Court was so enticing that Republican senators might be willing to lose their majority to accomplish it amid potential voter backlash.
One other factor might prompt Trump and McConnell to act sooner rather than later in whipping a Supreme Court nominee through the Senate.

A special election in Arizona has Republican Senator Martha McSally vulnerable to defeat by Democratic challenger Mark Kelly, a well-known former astronaut. The winner of that contest would not have to wait until Jan. 2 to be sworn-in like the rest of the senators and potentially could take office by early December.

Ginsburg, the first female Jewish member of the U.S. Supreme Court, died on one of the holiest days in Judaism, as many of the country's nearly six million Jews welcomed the new year 5781, based on the Hebrew calendar. 
Ginsburg was raised in a secular household, but explained in 2018 that her religious background influenced her life's work: ""I am a judge, born, raised and proud of being a Jew. The demand for justice, for peace and for enlightenment runs through the entirety of Jewish history and Jewish tradition.""
News of her death traveled quickly via social media, and became a focal point in many New Year's services, religious leaders and observant Jews said. 
""I heard of Ruth’s death while I was reciting the Mourner’s Kaddish at the Rosh Hashanah service,"" fellow Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer said in a statement, referring to a prayer in memory of the dead. 
Ginsburg was ""a great Justice, a woman of valour, a rock of righteousness, and my good, good friend,"" the statement said. ""The world is a better place for her having lived in it.""
Her death on the eve of Rosh Hashanah also has significance in Jewish tradition, rabbis and friends said. ""One of the themes of Rosh Hashanah suggest that very righteous people would die at the very end of the year because they were needed until the very end,"" said Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism. 
Those who die on the new year holiday are considered ""tzadik,"" a title given to the righteous and saintly. 
""God has held back until the last moment bc they were needed most & were the most righteous,"" National Public Radio journalist Nina Totenberg, a close friend of Ginsburg, wrote on Twitter. 
Ginsburg, born in 1933 - the year of the Kristallnacht pogrom against Jews in Germany - said her life's work was shaped by the Holocaust. ""It makes you more empathetic to other people who are not insiders, who are outsiders,"" she said in an interview in 2018.
Jacobs also noted Ginsburg was named for the biblical Ruth, the grandmother of the Jewish king David, and the person through whom redemption is supposed to come. 
""I like to think of our Ruth, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in terms of the generation to come that will carry on her legacy and do what she did - which is to repair many of the injustices of our world,"" he said. 

""All of us are her descendants and we must carry on the challenging work of fighting for justice.""

LONDON (Reuters) - More than a thousand people gathered in central London on Saturday to protest against lockdown measures aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus, before the event was broken up by police.
The protest, which led to 32 arrests, came as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is considering whether to reimpose some lockdown restrictions across England.
Demonstrators carried banners saying ""Covid is a hoax"" and ""My body, my choice: No to mandatory masks"", as well as chanting at police: ""Choose your side"".
Police said protesters were ordered to leave Trafalgar Square on the grounds that the demonstration was putting those taking part and other members of the public at risk.
""This, coupled with pockets of hostility and outbreaks of violence towards officers, means we will now be taking enforcement action to disperse those who remain in the area,"" London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement.
Under laws introduced to slow the spread of infection, people in England are not allowed to gather in groups of more than six. There are exemptions for political protests, but only if organisers follow guidelines to reduce the risk of the disease spreading.
Organisers of previous anti-lockdown protests have been fined up to 10,000 pounds ($12,914).
Some of the protesters at Saturday's event voiced opposition to compulsory vaccines, as well as more general mistrust of the government, the media and the World Health Organization.
Britain has suffered Europe's highest death toll from coronavirus, with more than 41,000 deaths on the government's preferred measure. National testing for the disease have not kept up with demand since schools reopened this month.

Rising case numbers in parts of Scotland, Wales and northern England have already led to local restrictions on people inviting friends to their homes, and reduced pub and restaurant opening hours.

OTTAWA - Former Canadian Prime Minister John Turner, who was in office for just 11 weeks and led his Liberal Party to a massive electoral defeat in 1984, died on Saturday aged 91, media reported.
Turner, who had previously held the posts of finance and justice minister, took over from Pierre Trudeau in late June 1984 at a time of increasing voter fatigue with the Liberals, who had been in power for 20 of the previous 21 years.
He called an election for September and then presided over what many political observers consider to be one of the worst campaigns in Canadian history, marred by a series of gaffes.
One key turning point came during a televised debate when Turner, under fire from Conservative leader Brian Mulroney, said he had no option but to approve a mass of patronage appointments proposed by Trudeau before he left office.
""You could have said 'I am not going to do it. This is wrong for Canada' ... you had an option, sir, to say no. And you chose to say yes,"" responded Mulroney in one of the most memorable moments in Canadian politics. The Conservatives swept to power with 211 seats of the 282 in the House of Commons.
The Liberals fell to just 40 seats from 135 but Turner hung onto his position. His 79-day tenure as prime minister is the second shortest in Canadian history.
In the 1988 election campaign he took a strong stance against a proposed free trade agreement with the United States but lost again to Mulroney, although not as badly.
He resigned as Liberal leader in 1990 and was replaced by Jean Chretien, who led the Liberals to victory in 1993.
Turner, a lawyer by training, served as finance minister from 1972 to 1975 but quit amid disagreements over policy with Trudeau. He returned to legal work for nine years before winning the Liberal Party leadership in June 1984.

John Napier Wyndham Turner was born on June 7, 1929. He is survived by his wife Geills and four children.

Defence ministry officials in Kabul, who said more than 40 Taliban fighters had been killed in the strikes, did not confirm any civilian casualties. They said an investigation was underway into the incident which comes as the warring sides hold peace talks.
""The first strike hit the Taliban base but the second one caused civilian casualties as they had gathered at the bombed site,"" said Fatima Aziz, a member of parliament who represents Kunduz.
She said 11 civilians were killed and five people were missing in the Khanabad district of Kunduz province.
According to another witness, the airstrikes left 12 civilians killed, including children, and 18 others injured. The witness said that several Taliban militants had been killed.
The Taliban issued a statement accusing Afghan forces of killing at least 40 civilians in the airstrikes. The hardline militant group did not comment on casualties among their fighters. 
Fighting between Afghan forces and the Taliban has continued even as representatives of the government and the insurgents gathered last week for historic peace talks aimed at ending two decades of war.
The negotiations are a result of a deal between the Taliban and the U.S. signed in February, which also paved the way for the withdrawal of all foreign forces by May 2021.

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haitian President Jovenel Moise has appointed nine members to a provisional electoral council tasked with preparing a constitutional referendum and organizing local, municipal, legislative and presidential elections in the Caribbean country.
The United States government this week reiterated a strongly worded call for Moise and other political forces to work together and arrange the elections.
Moise has ruled the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation by decree since mid-January and in recent weeks renewed protests against his leadership have flared up. 
The appointments to the provisional electoral council published on Friday in the government's newspaper are unlikely to placate Moise's opponents who argue he has failed to control corruption, crime and economic decline.
An anti-government demonstration by Haitians calling for Moise's ouster and other changes is planned for Sunday; earlier protests have often been violent and led to deaths.
It is not clear what the constitutional referendum will entail but Moise has previously said the powers of the president needed to be strengthened. 
The presidency was weakened in Haiti's 1987 Magna Carta.
Haitians mistrusted strong figureheads in the wake of the Duvalier family dictatorship notorious for human rights abuses and corruption. 
Moise has said he wants to break a ""decades-long cycle of political crises"" and could use a referendum to push through the overhaul of the constitution if he has no parliament to approve it. 
Among the new members, there are no representatives of key sectors instructed by the constitution such as the Episcopale Conference, the University Council, the Association of Journalists and others.
The appointments will likely be met with more resistance from the different opposition groups, united in their discontent over the government of Moise, a former banana exporter who took office in 2017.

In the fourth stop on his tour of South America, Pompeo said the partnership between Colombia and the United States was a force for good in the region. 
""Your support for interim (Venezuelan) president Juan Guaido and the democratic transition for a sovereign Venezuela free of malign influence ... is incredibly valued,"" Pompeo told Duque in a joint press conference in Bogota. 
Pompeo has used the tour to increase pressure on Maduro, who has overseen a six-year economic collapse and has been indicted in the United States on narcoterrorism charges, to resign.
A report this week by United Nations investigators found Maduro's government has committed systematic human rights violations including killings and torture amounting to crimes against humanity.
""The international community has to act to bring this situation to an end,"" said Duque, who calls Maduro a dictator and often accuses him of sheltering and supporting members of Colombian rebel groups. 
The Colombian government is among more than 50 countries which consider Venezuela's opposition leader Guaido to be the country's interim president.
Pompeo said the United States will continue to provide expertise and resources to help Colombia fight drug trafficking.
Colombia faces constant pressure from the United States, a major destination for cocaine, to reduce the size of crops of coca, the drug's chief ingredient.

Duque has set a target to destroy 130,000 hectares (321,237 acres) of coca this year, up from 100,000 hectares last year, and has signaled aerial spraying of the herbicide glyphosate could restart.

Belarus, a former Soviet republic closely allied with Russia, has been rocked by mass street protests since Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory in an Aug. 9 presidential election that his opponents say was rigged. He denies their accusation.
Saturday's protesters, most of them women, briefly scuffled with police who then blocked their path and started picking people one by one out of the crowd, the witness said.
In one location, dozens of female protesters could be seen encircled by men in green uniforms and black balaclavas outside a shopping mall as they shouted ""Only cowards beat women!""
Among the detained was 73-year-old opposition activist Nina Baginskaya who has become an icon of the protest movement after scuffling with armed policemen last month. 
One female protester was taken away in an ambulance after lying on the ground, apparently unconscious.
After the police stopped detaining people, the remaining protesters formed a chain along one of the central streets of the capital and chanted ""Long live Belarus!""
Lukashenko's crackdown on the protests has prompted the European Union to weigh fresh sanctions against his government.
Minsk reacted angrily on Saturday to reports that Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the leading opposition candidate in last month's election, could soon meet EU foreign ministers.
Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also criticised the EU for inviting Tsikhanouskaya to the ministerial meeting as well as for considering sanctions against Minsk, saying Brussels was trying to ""rock the boat"" in Belarus.
Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for 26 years, says the protesters are being backed by foreign powers and has offered to end the standoff with constitutional reforms but he refuses to stand down.

Earlier this month he secured a $1.5 billion lifeline from Moscow.

(Reuters) - Spain's far-left deputy prime minister said on Saturday that a financial scandal which has rocked the royal family had presented an ""historic moment"" to push for a republic.
Pablo Iglesias, leader of the Unidas Podemos party, the junior partner in Spain's coalition government, said the monarchy was no longer relevant to a younger generation. 
""Less and less people in Spain understand, especially young people, that in the 21st century citizens cannot choose who their head of state is and that he does not have to answer to justice like any citizen and cannot be removed from charge if you commit a crime,"" Iglesias told a party meeting.
Spain's former King Juan Carlos left the country under a cloud of scandal last month and is living in the United Arab Emirates. 
Once a popular monarch, he abdicated in favour of his son Felipe in 2014 after a tax fraud case involving members of his family and an ill-judged elephant hunting trip at a time when Spaniards were struggling with a deep recession. 
In June, the Supreme Court opened a preliminary investigation into the involvement of Juan Carlos in a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia. Switzerland's La Tribune de Geneve newspaper reported he had received $100 million from the late Saudi king. Swiss authorities have opened an investigation.
The former monarch is not formally under investigation and has repeatedly declined to comment on the subject. His lawyer says he remains at the Spanish prosecutor’s disposal.
As monarch, Juan Carlos benefited from full judicial immunity though he can be prosecuted for any wrongdoing since he abdicated. 

A poll published in August for the pro-monarchist ABC newspaper found 56% of respondents supported the monarchy, compared with 33.5% favoured a republic, while 6% did not know and 4.1% were indifferent.

The professor had posted about the planned protest, which he called ""A Day of Changes"", on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page and said that the event should help people to organize and act together.
Residents of Khabarovsk, which lies about 6,110 km (3,800 miles) east of Moscow, started protesting after the July 9 arrest of popular governor Sergei Furgal on murder charges that he denies.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A party founded by Lebanon's Christian president made a proposal to end a dispute that has blocked the formation of a new cabinet and threatened a French drive to lift the country out of its worst crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.
The proposal, put forward on Saturday, involved handing major ministries to smaller sectarian groups in a country where power is shared between Muslims and Christians.
There was no immediate comment from Shi'ite Muslim groups, which have insisted they choose who fills several posts. But a political source familiar with the thinking of dominant Shi'ite groups said the idea was unlikely to work.
Lebanon's efforts to swiftly form a new government have run into the sand over how to pick ministers in a country where political loyalties mostly follow sectarian religious lines.
A Sept. 15 deadline agreed with France to name a cabinet has passed. Paris, which is leading an international push to haul Lebanon back from economic collapse, has voiced exasperation and told Beirut to act ""without delay"".
The leader of the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), the party founded by President Michel Aoun and allied to Hezbollah, proposed ""undertaking an experiment to distribute the so-called sovereign ministries to smaller sects, specifically to the Druze, Alawites, Armenians and Christian minorities"".
The statement was issued after Gebran Bassil, FPM head and son-in-law of the president, chaired a meeting of the party's political leadership. Bassil is a Maronite, Lebanon's largest Christian community.
Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib, a Sunni Muslim under Lebanon's sectarian system of power sharing, wants to shake up the leadership of ministries, some of which have been controlled by the same factions for years.
Lebanon's main Shi'ite groups - the Amal Movement and the heavily armed, Iranian-backed Hezbollah - want to select the figures to fill a number of positions, including the finance minister, a top position often called a ""sovereign"" ministry.
An FPM official said the party had not discussed the idea about distributing ministries with Hezbollah or Amal. ""We are proposing an exit strategy for those who are stuck up a tree without a ladder,"" the official told Reuters.
With the nation buried under a mountain of debt and with its banks paralysed, the finance minister will play a crucial role as Lebanon seeks to restart stalled talks with the International Monetary Fund, one of the first steps on France's roadmap.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Around 20,000 people protested in Thailand's capital on Saturday against the government of former coup leader and Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, with many demonstrators also calling for reforms to the monarchy.
""Down with feudalism, long live the people,"" was one of the chants at the biggest demonstration in Bangkok since Prayuth took power in a 2014 coup.
Protests have been building in the southeast Asian country since mid July, demanding the removal of the government, a new constitution and elections. They have also broken a long-standing taboo by criticising the monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
Saturday's protests moved from the campus of Thammasat University, a traditional hotbed of opposition to the military and royalist establishment, on to Sanam Luang - translated as Royal Field - outside the Grand Palace.
""I hope the people in power will see the importance of the people,"" student leader Panupong ""Mike"" Jadnok, told the crowd. ""We are fighting to put the monarchy in the right place, not to abolish it.""
Organisers said there were 50,000 people present in the latest demonstration. Police said there were at least 18,000, still enough to make it bigger than a protest last month. Protesters have said they plan to stay overnight and march to Government House on Sunday morning.
The king was not in Thailand and has spent much of his time in Europe since taking the throne from his late father in 2016. The Royal Palace was not available for comment on the protests. 
“People can protest but they should do that peacefully and within the law,” said government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri.
COUP ANNIVERSARY
Sept. 19 is the anniversary of the coup against the populist then-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006. Among the protesters were many of his red shirt followers, veterans of clashes a decade ago with pro-establishment yellow shirts.
“I’m here to fight for the future of my children and grandchildren. I hope that by the time I die, they will become free,” said 68-year-old Tasawan Suebthai, a redshirt with amulets round her neck which she hoped would ward off bullets.
So far the latest protests have been peaceful.
The military, which proclaims itself the defender of the monarchy and national stability, has carried out several bloody crackdowns on protesters since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 as well as 13 successful coups.
Prayuth has said the government would allow protests but that demands for reform of the monarchy were not acceptable.
A 20-year-old student, who gave her name only as Waan for fear of reprisals, said it was time to reform the monarchy. ""It’s a problem that’s been swept under the rug for so long. This must end right here.”
Protesters demand the scrapping of a lese majeste law against criticism of the monarchy. They also seek to reduce the king's constitutional powers and his control over the palace fortune and units of the army.
The last time such a large crowd assembled at Sanam Luang was in mourning for the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who was widely revered in the country of 70 million.

There were also sympathy protests in Taipei and Tokyo while others were planned in Europe and North America.

In a statement, the Delhi Police said 61-year-old Rajeev Sharma was arrested earlier this week and officers had seized some confidential documents related to the Indian defence department from the journalist's residence.
One Chinese woman and her Nepalese partner were also arrested for allegedly supplying Sharma with ""huge amounts of money"" for ""conveying information to Chinese intelligence"".
The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. 
Reuters could not immediately reach any of the three individuals, who are under arrest, or their lawyers.
""On interrogation, Rajeev Sharma has disclosed his involvement in procurement of secret/sensitive information and further conveying the same to his Chinese handlers,"" Delhi's Deputy Commissioner of Police Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said in the statement.
The arrest comes amid heightened tensions between India and China at their border in the Himalayan region. The relationship between the neighbours has worsened since a clash in June that India says of 20 of its troops were killed.
China suffered ""far fewer"" than the 20 deaths incurred by India's military in the clash, according to a tweet this week by the editor-in-chief of the Global Times, which is published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party. 
The police said Sharma was tasked with providing information on India-China boundary issues and other matters in recent years.
It added that between January 2019 and September 2020, Sharma received more than 3 million Indian rupees ($40,799.67) from one of his handlers. 
India has in recent months banned several Chinese apps and made it tougher for Chinese companies to make investments.

Jawar, founder of the Oromiya Media Network and a member of the Oromo Federalist Congress party, was arrested in June amid the widespread unrest that followed the assassination of popular Oromo musician Haacaaluu Hundeessaa. 
Jawar and 22 other activists, including Oromo opposition leader Bekele Garba, face charges relating to the violation of anti-terrorism laws, telecom fraud laws and firearms laws, the attorney general's office said in a statement on social media.
Those charged include journalists and scholars. Bekele is a senior leader of the Oromo Federalist Congress.
They will appear in court on Monday to answer to the charges, the attorney general's office said in the statement.
Jawar, a former ally of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, was instrumental in the Oromo protests that brought Abiy to power in 2018. But he became a critic of Abiy, accusing the prime minister of failing to protect Oromo interests.
Tuuli Baayyis, Jawar's lawyer, told Reuters that they had learnt about the charges from social media as formal charge papers had not been provided to them yet. He did not comment on the charges.
At least nine people have died in the Oromiya region around Addis Ababa following clashes between Ethiopian security forces and protesters demanding the release of the detained Oromo opposition politicians.
The unrest in Oromiya highlights the challenges facing Abiy ahead of elections which were due this August, but were postponed due to the coronavirus crisis.

278,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2020 08:26AM ET</span>",Explainer: U.S. says U.N. sanctions on Iran to be reimposed Saturday. What does that mean?,"By Michelle Nichols
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration says that on Saturday (2000 EDT Sunday) all United Nations sanctions on Iran have to be restored and a conventional arms embargo on the country will no longer expire in mid-October. 
But 13 of the 15 U.N. Security Council members, including long-time U.S. allies, say Washington's move is void and diplomats say few countries are likely to reimpose the measures, which were lifted under a 2015 deal between world powers and Iran that aimed to stop Tehran developing nuclear weapons. 
Here is a look at the events leading to this showdown and an explanation of what could happen next: 
WHY IS THE ARMS EMBARGO ON IRAN EXPIRING? 
The Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Iran in 2007. 
The embargo is due to expire on Oct. 18, as agreed under the nuclear deal among Iran, Russia, China, Germany, Britain, France and the United States that seeks to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in return for sanctions relief. It is enshrined in a 2015 Security Council resolution. 
In 2018, Trump quit the accord reached under his predecessor Barack Obama, calling it ""the worst deal ever."" The United States failed last month in a bid to extend the Iran embargo at the Security Council.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE 2015 NUCLEAR DEAL? 
The remaining parties to the nuclear deal have said they are committed to maintaining the agreement. Iran has said it would remain in place despite the U.S. move at the United Nations.
Britain, France and Germany told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that U.N. sanctions relief for Iran would continue beyond Sept. 20.
""We have worked tirelessly to preserve the nuclear agreement and remain committed to do so,"" the U.N. envoys for the three countries said in a letter to the Council, seen by Reuters. 
WHAT SANCTIONS WOULD 'SNAPBACK'? 
A return of U.N. sanctions, a so-called snapback, would require Iran to suspend all nuclear enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development, and ban imports of anything that could contribute to those activities or to development of nuclear weapon delivery systems. 
It would reimpose the arms embargo, ban Iran from developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and bring back targeted sanctions on dozens of individuals and entities. Countries also would be urged to inspect shipments to and from Iran and authorized to seize any banned cargo.
WHAT LED TO THIS SHOWDOWN? 
The United States submitted a complaint about Iran breaching the nuclear deal to the Security Council last month.
In response to the U.S. quitting the accord and imposing unilateral sanctions in a bid to get Iran to negotiate a new deal, Tehran has breached central limits of the pact, including on its stock of enriched uranium
Under a 2015 U.N. Security Council resolution enshrining the nuclear deal, the United States says that it triggered a 30-day process leading to a snapback of all U.N. sanctions on Iran. Washington argues that while it quit the nuclear deal in 2018, the 2015 resolution still names it as a participant.
Under the sanctions snapback process if a Security Council resolution to extend sanctions relief on Iran is not adopted within the 30 days, then U.N. sanctions are supposed to be reimposed. No such resolution has been put forward for a vote. 
Indonesia, the president of the Security Council for August, said last month that it was ""not in the position to take further action"" on the U.S. bid to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran because there was no consensus in the body.
Thirteen of the 15 council members expressed their opposition, arguing that Washington's move is void given it is using a process agreed under the nuclear deal it is no longer a party to.
WHAT WILL THE UNITED STATES DO NOW? 
Trump plans to issue an executive order https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-arms-exclusive/exclusive-trump-plans-executive-order-to-punish-arms-trade-with-iran-sources-idUSKBN268308?il=0 allowing him to impose U.S. sanctions on anyone who violates the U.N. arms embargo on Iran, sources told Reuters, in a bid to reinforce the U.S. assertion that the measure has been extended indefinitely beyond Oct. 18.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Thursday that the order was expected in the coming days and would allow Trump to punish foreign actors - U.S. entities are already barred from trading weapons with Iran - by depriving them of access to the U.S. market.
HOW MIGHT A BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HANDLE IRAN?
Three senior Iranian officials have told Reuters that Iran's leadership is determined to remain committed to the nuclear deal, hoping that a victory by Trump's political rival Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 election will salvage the pact.
Biden, who was vice president when the Obama administration negotiated the accord, said he would rejoin the deal if Iran first resumed compliance.

""If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement and build on it, while working with allies to push back on Iran's destabilizing actions,"" Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said.

Tough border restrictions to keep the coronavirus under control have led to a 97.5% plunge in international travel in the region, according to the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines.
Many frequent flyers miss getting on planes and airlines including Taiwan's EVA Airways Corp and Japan's ANA Holdings Inc, desperate for revenue and to keep their pilots' licences current, have offered special sightseeing flights.
Saturday's flight by Tigerair Taiwan, the low-cost unit of Taiwan's largest carrier China Airlines, took off from Taipei's Taoyuan International Airport and flew up to Jeju, circling low to give passengers a chance to see the island, though mist limited views, and then flying back to Taiwan.
""I feel like I haven't gone abroad for a long time, and I think this event is very special. It's a good deal,"" said passenger Chen Shu-tzu, 43. 
Some passengers wore traditional Korean dress to mark the flight.
Passengers and staff posed for pictures before the flight took off, holding a sign in Chinese, Korean and English reading: ""South Korea is missing you. Tigerair Taiwan Longing flight (to) take off.""
While international travel has collapsed, domestic travel is booming in Taiwan, where the pandemic is well under control.

Flights to Taiwan's sun soaked offshore islands and rugged east coast are packed, with Tigerair leasing out some of its aircraft to bolster supply on domestic routes.

Data released late on Friday showed the Conservatives and Labour both on 40% support, based on online polling of 1,618 adults conducted on Sept. 16 and Sept. 17.
A previous YouGov poll on Sept. 9 showed the Conservatives on 42% and Labour on 37%.
This is the first time YouGov, one of Britain's main polling organisations, has shown Labour level with the Conservatives since May 2019, just before Theresa May said she would resign as prime minister and while Jeremy Corbyn still led Labour.
A poll by Opinium on Aug. 30 also showed the two parties level.
Johnson became prime minister in July last year and in December won the Conservatives their largest election victory since 1987, gaining an 80 seat majority which is likely to keep them in power until at least 2024.
However Johnson's popularity has fallen since December, due largely to growing public concern about his government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Faced with a choice between Johnson and Labour's new leader Keir Starmer - a former chief prosecutor who succeeded Corbyn in April - 35% of those polled said they preferred Starmer, while 30% favoured Johnson.

Labour begins its annual party conference this weekend, while the Conservatives hold theirs from Oct. 3-6.

Despite opposition from environmental campaigners, President Rodrigo Duterte's government has filled a 500-meter stretch of coastline beside the U.S. embassy in Manila with sand made from tonnes of crushed dolomite boulders from central Philippines.
Manila Bay is a 60-km (37-mile) semi-enclosed estuary facing the South China Sea. Its waters are heavily polluted by oil, grease and trash from nearby residential areas and ports.
The use of artificial sand has been met with criticism, with environmental groups saying the facelift focuses only on aesthetics and has little to do with rehabilitation.
Fernando Hicap, president of fisherfolk group Pamalakaya, told Reuters that the pollution was killing fish stocks in the bay. ""There is still so much garbage,"" he said.
Despite fears that dolomite could be a health hazard, Manila Mayor Francisco Domagoso assured the public that the cleanup and beautification project is not a threat to residents' well-being.
""When we see something nice being done to our city and if we feel it is for the betterment of our city, we should always be supportive of that,"" Domagoso said in a speech to mark the opening of the beach to the public.

The incident is the second time this year that a British police officer has been suspended in similar circumstances. One of former Prime Minister David Cameron's bodyguards mislaid his firearm and Cameron's passport in a plane toilet in February.
Britain's Sun newspaper said a cleaner at London's Heathrow Airport found a semi-automatic Glock 19 pistol on a United Airlines plane which had just landed after an overnight flight from Washington.
Raab had been travelling back to Britain on the flight after meeting U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
""We are aware of the incident on a flight into the UK on Friday 18 September and we are taking this matter extremely seriously,"" London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement.
""The officer involved has since been removed from operational duties whilst an internal investigation into the circumstances is taking place,"" it said.
The Sun said the officer had been sorting out passports when he took off his holster with the pistol in it, and left it on the seat of the plane.

A police spokesman said he could not comment on the details of the Sun's report.

The army said in a statement, released on its website on Friday, that 1,320 kgs of fireworks were found in 120 boxes in a warehouse during a search of the port. It said army engineers disposed of them.
The port and a swathe of central Beirut was ruined by the huge blast on Aug. 4 that killed at least 190 people. It was blamed on 2,750 tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate kept at the port for years in poor condition.
Warehouses and concrete grain silos at the port were destroyed.

Lebanon's army said on Sept. 3 it had also found a further 4.35 tonnes of ammonium nitrate near the entrance to Beirut port, which the army said at the time it was dealing with.

""The group was planning to undertake terrorist attacks at vital installations in India with an aim to kill innocent people and strike terror in their minds,"" the country's main counter-terrorism arm said in a statement.
Those arrested ""were motivated to undertake attacks at multiple places"" including the capital region.
Six of the militants were arrested in the eastern state of West Bengal and while three in the southern state of Kerala, the NIA said, adding the individuals were ""associated with Pakistan sponsored module of al Qaeda"".
A spokesman for Pakistan's foreign office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pakistan has often denied giving material support to militants.
India has stepped up an offensive against militants in the Muslim-majority region of Kashmir and elsewhere.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's air force scrambled jets for a second consecutive day on Saturday as multiple Chinese aircraft approached the island and crossed the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, with the island's government urging Beijing to ""pull back from the edge.""
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said 19 Chinese aircraft were involved, one more than in the previous day, with some crossing the Taiwan Strait midline and others flying into Taiwan's air defence identification zone off its southwest coast.
It said China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, sent 12 J-16 fighters, two J-10 fighters, two J-11 fighters, two H-6 bombers and one Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft. According to a map the ministry provided, none got close to mainland Taiwan itself or flew over it.
""ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defence missile system to monitor the activities,"" the ministry said in a tweet, referring to the Republic of China Air Force, the formal name of Taiwan's air force.
Taiwan has complained of repeated incidents of Chinese aircraft near the island this year, and has regularly had to scramble its F-16s and other jets to intercept them.
China had on Friday announced, at a news conference in Beijing about China's U.N. peacekeeping efforts, combat drills near the Taiwan Strait and denounced what it called collusion between the island and the United States.
U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a three-day visit, the most senior State Department official to come to Taiwan in four decades, angering China. He left Saturday afternoon, according to Taiwan's foreign ministry.
'PULL BACK FROM THE EDGE'
Taiwan's Defence Ministry, in a separate statement, said China was carrying out provocative activities, seriously damaging peace and stability.
""The Defence Ministry sternly condemns this, and calls on the mainland authorities to control themselves and pull back from the edge.""
China's widely read state-backed tabloid the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said in a Saturday editorial that Friday's drills were a rehearsal to take over Taiwan.
""The U.S. and Taiwan must not misjudge the situation, or believe the exercise is a bluff. Should they continue to make provocations, a war will inevitably break out,"" it said.
Both sides need to resume dialogue to reduce the risk of war, Johnny Chiang, leader of Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang, wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
""People who are willing to play a communication role are stigmatised and people who clamour for war are regarded as heroes. Such an atmosphere is definitely not conducive to the peaceful and stable development of the Taiwan Strait,"" said Chiang, whose party traditional favours close ties with China.
Life has continued as normal in Taiwan with no sign of panic. The island has long been accustomed to living with Chinese threats. 
Taiwan's people have shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China, re-electing President Tsai Ing-wen in a landslide last year on what was largely a platform of standing up to Beijing.
The latest Chinese flights came the same day Taiwan held a memorial service for former president Lee Teng-hui, dubbed ""Mr. Democracy"" for ending autocratic rule in favour of free elections and championing Taiwan's separate identity from China.
Lee, who died in July, became Taiwan's first democratically elected president in March 1996 after eight months of intimidating war games and missile tests by China in waters around the island.

Those events brought China and Taiwan to the verge of conflict, prompting the United States to send an aircraft carrier task force to the area in a warning to Beijing's government.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan bid farewell on Saturday to former president Lee Teng-hui, dubbed ""Mr. Democracy"" for ending autocratic rule in favor of free elections and championing Taiwan's separate identity from China, as Beijing again sent jets close to the island.
Lee's memorial service took place in the shadow of renewed Chinese war games, as did his election as Taiwan's first democratic leader in 1996. China claims the island as its own territory.
Lee, who died in July, was president from 1988 to 2000. 
His greatest act of defiance was becoming Taiwan's first democratically elected president in March 1996, achieved in a landslide following eight months of intimidating war games and missile tests by China in waters around the island.
Those events brought China and Taiwan to the verge of conflict, prompting the United States to send an aircraft carrier task force to the area in a warning to the Beijing government.
On Friday and again on Saturday, China carried out drills in the Taiwan Strait, sending 19 aircraft near the island on Saturday alone, as Beijing expressed anger at the visit of a senior U.S. official to Taipei, there for Lee's memorial.[nL4N2GG046]
Speaking at the memorial service in a chapel at a Taipei university, President Tsai Ing-wen said he had shaped the Taiwan of today. 
""Confronted with daunting international challenges, he skilfully led the people of Taiwan by promoting pragmatic diplomacy. Taiwan became synonymous with democracy and was catapulted onto the world stage. Because of this, President Lee came to be lauded as Mr. Democracy,"" Tsai said. ""Thanks to his efforts, Taiwan now shines as a beacon of democracy.""
Lee, a devout Christian, was 97.
U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach and former Japanese prime minister Yoshiro Mori also attended his memorial, and Japan's de facto ambassador in Taiwan read a statement from recently resigned Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing also reviles as a separatist, sent a recorded video message for his ""close friend"" Lee.
""Now he is no longer here, but we Buddhists believe in life after life, so most probably he will be reborn in Taiwan,"" he said.

Lee's remains will be interred at a military cemetery next month.

Health experts have warned that reducing gaps between passengers in trains, buses and jeepneys could result in a surge of infections in the Philippines, which has the most confirmed COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia.
Duterte studied recommendations and decided to retain the 1 meter distancing requirement, including a ban on eating and speaking in public transport, presidential spokesman Harry Roque told state-run PTV4 network. Passengers still need to wear face shield and mask at all times, he added.
The transport ministry, which cut the distance to 75cm on Monday, 50cm on Sept. 28 and 30cm on Oct. 12 to accommodate more passengers returning to work as the economy gradually reopens, said it will comply with the president's decision.
""We shall aggressively comply and strictly enforce the 1-metre physical distancing in all public transport as envisioned and mandated,"" the transport ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
The World Health Organization recommends at least 1 meter of distancing to avoid the spread of the virus.
Manila's transport systems are notoriously crowded, with commutes typically involving long queues and several changes. 
Experts and medical professionals have described as dangerous and premature a reduction in distancing requirement, warning it could prolong a first wave of infections that the Philippines has been battling since March.

The Philippines has nearly 280,000 infections, more than a third of which were reported in the past 30 days, and 4,830 deaths, the second most in Southeast Asia, next only to Indonesia.

Abe announced the visit on his official Twitter account along with a photo of himself at the shrine, just days after Yoshihide Suga succeeded him as Japan's leader. Japan's longest-serving leader stepped down, citing health problems.
The shrine is seen by Beijing and Seoul as a symbol of Japan's past military aggression because it honours 14 Japanese wartime leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal as well as war dead.
Abe had only visited the shrine in person once during his last tenure as prime minister but regularly sent offerings via an aide during the shrine's spring and autumn festivals. 
His pilgrimage to the shrine in 2013 sparked outrage in South Korea and China and an expression of ""disappointment"" from the United States.
Washington and Tokyo have become close security allies in the decades since the war's end but its legacy has left scars in East Asia.
Ties between Tokyo and Seoul have remained strained due to bitter memories of Japan's 1910-1945 colonisation of Korea, including a dispute over compensation for Koreans forced to work on Japan's sites during wartime. Tokyo says the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty normalising relations.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A firefighter has perished in a blaze that was ignited two weeks at a gender-reveal party, the U.S. Forest Service reported on Friday, as welcomed thundershowers brought some relief to weary fire crews in western Oregon.
The firefighter's death on Thursday in the San Bernardino National Forest east of Los Angeles raised the death toll to at least 35 in the catastrophic spate of wildfires raging across the western United States in recent weeks.
Twenty-six of those victims have died in California, including two other firefighters - a Forest Service contractor killed in a lightning-sparked fire in northern California, and a private helicopter pilot whose chopper crashed on a water-dropping mission in Fresno County last month.
Authorities withheld the identity of the latest firefighter fatality pending notification of next of kin. 
No details on the circumstances were immediately released except that the death occurred during the El Dorado Fire, which investigators have determined was triggered by pyrotechnics during a gender-reveal celebration on Sept. 5.
That blaze has since charred more than 21,000 acres (8,500 hectares) and was 66% contained as of Friday, authorities said. Twelve firefighters have suffered minor injuries and at least 10 structures have been destroyed by that fire.
UNPRECEDENTED FIRE CRISIS 
Scores of wildfires have blackened some 3.2 million acres (1.3 million hectares in California since mid-August and another 1.7 million acres (650,000 hectares) in Oregon and Washington state since Labor Day.
The blazes, described by scientists and officials as unprecedented in scope and magnitude, have largely incinerated several small towns and destroyed thousands of dwellings in all three states. The fires, many sparked by intense lightning storms, were stoked early on by record-breaking heat, drought-parched vegetation and bouts of howling winds.
Civilians account for the remaining 23 confirmed fire-related deaths in California since mid-August, as well as the eight in Oregon and one in Washington state. Thousands of evacuees, particularly in Oregon, remained huddled in emergency shelters, mobile trailers and hotel rooms.
Communities in Oregon, unaccustomed to wildfires of such magnitude and lacking sufficient resources to deal with them, was especially hard hit. Emergency management officials have warned the death toll there could climb as search teams scour the ruins of homes engulfed in flames during chaotic evacuations early in the disaster. 
Thundershowers brought drenching rains to the western slopes of the Cascade Mountains late Thursday and through Friday, helping a force of more than 6,000 firefighters make further headway against 10 major blazes still burning in Oregon.
The heavy rains also prompted flood and landslide warnings in areas where fire has stripped hillsides and canyons of vegetation.
Cooler, more favorable weather in the region since last week has already dispelled some of the smoky, polluted air and tempered the flames, enabling ground teams with axes and bulldozers to take the offensive while also allowing greater use of water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers.
Higher humidity levels were likewise bolstering hopes for subduing blazes in the greater San Francisco Bay area.
""Milder weather is helping the fire fight as crews continue to gain ground on many of the major incidents,"" the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said on Friday.

A key sign of success in the three states' efforts to control the fires has been a steady rise in containment, a measure of the buffer lines that firefighters carve around the perimeter of each blaze by hacking away unburned vegetation to prevent its spread.

295,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>","After U.S. claims, France says no evidence of Hezbollah explosives stores","PARIS (Reuters) - France's foreign ministry on Friday said there was no evidence to suggest the armed wing of Lebanon's Hezbollah was storing chemicals to make explosives in France after a senior U.S. official said the group had set up caches in Europe since 2012. 
Speaking on Thursday, Nathan Sales, the U.S. State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, accused the Iran-backed group of smuggling and storing chemicals, including ammonium nitrate, from Belgium to France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Switzerland.
""It stores these weapons in places so it can conduct major terrorist attacks whenever its masters in Tehran deem necessary,"" Sales said in a briefing without elaborating or providing evidence of the activities. 
Ammonium nitrate is an industrial chemical commonly used in fertilisers and as an explosive used for quarrying and mining. It is considered relatively safe if uncontaminated and stored properly. 
It is extremely dangerous if contaminated, mixed with fuel or stored unsafely, as was seen at the Beirut port in August after 2,750-tonnes of it exploded, destroying the port and killing at least 190 people.
""To our knowledge, there is nothing tangible to confirm such an allegation in France today,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll told reporters in response to Sales' allegations.
Unlike the United States, which has designated the heavily armed and politically powerful Hezbollah movement as a terrorist group since 1997, France has said its elected arm has a legitimate political role.
France is spearheading efforts to set Lebanon on a new course after decades of corrupt rule that has led to its deepest crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.
Its European allies, Germany and Britain, also consider the group a terrorist organisation, but French officials argue that ostracising it would make efforts to resolve the crisis impossible. 
Sales said the chemicals had been smuggled into Europe in first-aid kits and were possibly in Spain, Greece and Italy.
""Any illegal activity committed by a foreign organisation on our territory would be sanctioned by the French authorities with the greatest firmness,"" von der Muhll said.

""We urge all the Lebanese political forces to assume their responsibilities and agree without delay on the formation by Moustapha Adib of a mission government capable of launching the necessary reforms to meet the aspirations of the Lebanese people.""

""They want what all human beings want - dignity, they want a democratic, peaceful, sovereign Venezuela to call home, one where they and their children can find jobs and live,"" he said at an air base in Boa Vista, capital of Roraima state.
He blamed Maduro for a ""man-made crisis"" of unprecedented proportions in Venezuela and called the Venezuelan president a ""drug-trafficker,"" in comments to reporters. 
Pompeo also visited a soup kitchen serving hungry migrants with Brazilian Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo. Brazil's right-wing government two weeks ago declared Maduros's diplomats personae non gratae but stopped short of expelling them. 
Pompeo praised Brazil's humanitarian efforts to receive 250,000 Venezuelans who have crossed the border, some of the more than 5 million that have left their country due to the political and economic turmoil.
He said Washington was announcing another $348 million to help Venezuelan refugees, including $30 million for those in Brazil, bringing total US contribution to more than $1.2 billion
Brazil's border with Venezuela has been closed since March 18 due to the coronavirus pandemic, and the flow of migrants crossing into Brazil has dropped from an average of 600 a day to a handful of Venezuelans who walk along cross-country trails.
Pompeo visited Guyana and Suriname before Brazil and continues on Friday to Colombia, all neighbors of Venezuela. 
International efforts to encourage democratic change in Venezuela appear to have stalled and Maduro has asserted his grip on power.
Pompeo's stopover was deplored by former Brazilian leftist President Luiz Inacio da Silva, who said the U.S. official had only visited Brazil to ""provoke Venezuela.""

""Whether we like him or not, Venezuela has an elected president. The United States needs to drop this habit of wanting to be the world's sheriff,"" Lula told Reuters in an interview.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's presidential election race, a re-run of a fraught ballot last year that plunged the Andean country into turmoil, has tightened after interim President Jeanine Anez dropped out, likely helping rein in the front-running socialist party.
The withdrawal of Anez, who took power in a vacuum last year, will strengthen other centrist and conservative runners, who are behind in the polls against Luis Arce, the candidate of former leftist President Evo Morales' MAS party.
Morales was forced to step down last year after allegations of electoral fraud sparked widespread protests. Morales, currently in Argentina, has said he was toppled in a coup.
The withdrawal should boost Carlos Mesa, who placed second behind Morales in the since annulled 2019 election. Anez had around 10% of the likely vote, according to a recent major poll.
""(Mesa) is likely to attract the tactical vote and cement his position as the leading candidate that can force a second round and unite the anti-MAS vote,"" said Rodrigo Riaza, a Latin America analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit.
Anez has not yet endorsed another candidate and Mesa said on Friday he was the only candidate that could take on MAS.
Arce leads the pack with around 40% of the vote, the recent poll before Anez's withdrawal showed, while Mesa had around 26%.
A candidate needs 40% of the vote and a 10-point lead to claim outright victory in the first round.
The Oct. 18 election will be key to the direction of the landlocked country, which under Morales was an ally of Venezuela and Cuba, but which under Anez has swung dramatically toward the right, including rekindling ties with the United States.
""People are aware that the future of the country is at stake in these elections,"" said Roberto Luna, a resident of La Paz. ""The right does not have arguments or a political program with a vision for the country."" 
Other voters still scarred by the deadly violence that broke around the last election, said they wanted to avoid Morales' party coming back into power. He had been criticized for seeking a fourth term despite constitutional limits.
""Many citizens, many provinces no longer want to know of MAS, they are tired of so many abnormal situations that occurred in the 14 years of the government,"" said Boris Alcón, a resident of the city of El Alto. 
Riaza, the analyst, said that the end of Anez's controversial candidacy - she has initially ruled herself out - would ease concerns around the legitimacy of the result, but the risk of further political crisis remained high.]
""The political climate is highly polarized and ripe for social unrest. There is a real chance election results could be disputed again, which could trigger widespread protests and threaten a smooth transition of power.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he did not want another national lockdown but that new restrictions may be needed because the country was facing an ""inevitable"" second wave of COVID-19. 
Ministers were on Friday reported to be considering a second national lockdown, after new COVID-19 cases almost doubled to 6,000 per day, hospital admissions rose and infection rates soared across parts of northern England and London.
That rise in cases was part of a second wave that was now unstoppable, the prime minister said.
""We are now seeing a second wave coming in...It is absolutely, I'm afraid, inevitable, that we will see it in this country,"" Johnson told UK media. 
Asked about whether the whole of the country should brace for a new lockdown, rather than just local restrictions, he said: ""I don't want to get into a second national lockdown at all.""
But he did not rule out further national restrictions being brought in. 
""When you look at what is happening, you've got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six that we brought in on Monday,"" he said, referring to the ban on gatherings of more than six people. 
The United Kingdom has reported the fifth largest number of deaths from COVID-19 in the world, after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University of Medicine. 
The UK's official number of new positive cases shot up by nearly a thousand on Friday to 4,322, the highest since May 8, after a separate ONS model pointed to about 6,000 new cases a day in England in the week to Sept. 10.
That was up from modelling of 3,200 cases per day in the previous week, with the North West and London seen as hotspots.
Health Minister Matt Hancock called a second national lockdown a last resort earlier on Friday and when he was asked about it said: ""I can't give you that answer now.""
SPREADING WIDELY ACROSS ALL AGES
The UK said its reproduction ""R"" number of infections has risen to a range of 1.1-1.4 from last week's 1.0-1.2.
""We’re seeing clear signs this virus is now spreading widely across all age groups and I am particularly worried by the increase in rates of admission to hospital and intensive care among older people,"" said Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director at Public Health England.
""This could be a warning of far worse things to come.""
Britain imposed new COVID regulations on the North West, Midlands and West Yorkshire from Tuesday. More than 10 million people in the United Kingdom are already in local lockdown, and restrictions for millions more could be on the way. 
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said later on Friday that it was ""increasingly likely"" that additional measures would soon be required in Britain's biggest city. He said he had seen evidence about the spread of the virus in London which was ""extremely"" concerning. 
COVID-19 cases started to rise again in Britain in September, with between 3,000 and 4,000 positive tests recorded daily in the last week. This is still some way behind France, which is seeing more than 10,000 new cases a day. 
""COVID-19 infection rates have increased in most regions, particularly the North West and London,"" the ONS said.
The ONS said there had been clear evidence of an increase in the number of people testing positive aged 2 to 11 years, 17 to 24 years and 25 to 34 years.
Johnson was criticised by opposition politicians for his initial response to the outbreak and the government has struggled to ensure sufficient testing in recent weeks.

Asked by LBC radio why the testing system was such a ""shambles"", Hancock said Dido Harding, who is in charge of the system, had done an ""an extraordinary job.""

""We have to comply,"" he said during his morning news conference, about a water transfer that this month sparked deadly protests in a drought-hit Mexican state. Lopez Obrador has been working to maintain a good relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump. 
His comments came after Texas Governor Greg Abbott wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier this week asking Washington to ""ensure enforcement"" of Mexico's treaty obligations.
""Lack of water negatively impacts multiple stakeholders within the Rio Grande Valley, forcing Texas water users to secure alternate sources of water, change crops, and reduce operations,"" Abbott wrote.
The treaty, signed in 1944, stipulates that Mexico must deliver 1,750,000 acre-feet of water to the United States over a five-year period. Mexico also gets U.S. water from the Colorado River, under the treaty. 
For Mexico to comply with the agreement, it must deliver about one year's worth of water before the cycle ends on Oct. 24, according to Abbott's letter.
Lopez Obrador said it was not possible to seek an extension to the deadline. 
Two people were killed by the National Guard his month in the drought-hit northern Mexican border state of Chihuahua, after residents occupied the La Boquilla dam, which diverts water to the United States.
The opposition and protests in Chihuahua put Lopez Obrador in a difficult position politically, and despite his commitment to supply the water, he previously said that in the worst case scenario he could turn to Trump for help.

The Taliban, whose rigid Islamist government was overthrown by U.S. forces which invaded Afghanistan a month after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, began peace negotiations with the Afghan government this week to end two decades of war.
""We're dealing very well with the Taliban,"" Trump told a news conference. ""They're very tough, they're very smart, they're very sharp, but you know it's been 19 years and even they are tired of fighting, in all fairness.""
Trump, who is seeking re-election on Nov. 3, is eager to claim an end to America's longest conflict, and his administration has voiced its intention to use aid as leverage to push for a peace deal in Afghanistan.
The United States is set to withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan by May 2021, subject to the Taliban meeting certain security guarantees.

Taliban and Afghan government peace negotiators held their first formal meeting on Tuesday in Doha, after an opening ceremony on Saturday which was attended by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

""We categorically reject the baseless allegations of human rights violations claimed against the Syrian opposition... and concerning our country in relation to them,"" the Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday.
On Tuesday, U.N. war crimes investigators said Turkey must rein in Syrian rebels it supports in northern Syria who may have carried out kidnappings, torture and looting of civilian property following a report covering the first half of 2020.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said the human rights situation in parts of northern Syria is grim and called on Turkey to ensure that violations committed by armed groups under their control cease.
""I urge Turkey to immediately launch an impartial, transparent and independent investigation into the incidents we have verified,"" Bachelet also said.
Ankara also rejected the criticism and called it groundless.
Ankara backs rebels trying to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad backed by Russia and Iran. Turkey seized control of some northern border towns in recent years with cross border incursions to push back Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters, which Ankara views as a terrorist group.

The agreement comes as U.S. oil major  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), as part of a consortium with  Hess Corp  (NYSE:HES) and China's CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd, ramps up crude output from Guyana's massive offshore Stabroek block, a large portion of which is in waters claimed by Venezuela. 
""Greater security, greater capacity to understand your border space, what's happening inside your Exclusive Economic Zone - those are all things that give Guyana sovereignty,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a joint appearance with newly-installed Guyanese President Irfaan Ali. 
Pompeo is using his four-nation South America tour to ramp up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen a six-year economic collapse and has been indicted in the United States on narcoterrorism charges, to resign. 
""We know that the Maduro regime has decimated the people of Venezuela and that Maduro himself is an indicted narcotics trafficker. That means he has to leave,"" Pompeo told reporters during his appearance in Georgetown with Ali. 
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Maduro, who accuses the United States of seeking to provoke a coup and seize control of the OPEC nation's vast oil reserves, remains in power despite the 18-month campaign of economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure led by Washington. 
The latest salvo in a century-long border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela that is currently being evaluated at the International Court of Justice came in late 2018, when Venezuela's navy intercepted a vessel conducting a seismic survey on Exxon's behalf.
A series of offshore oil discoveries in recent years have given Guyana, which has no history of oil production, the potential to become one of Latin America's largest producers.

""We have had various difficulties and I think we welcome any help that would enhance our security, that would enhance our ability to protect our borders,"" Ali said.

306,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 02:50PM ET</span>","Kremlin: bottle in Navalny case could have been evidence, but was removed from Russia","MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Friday that a water bottle found in the hotel room of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who Germany and other western governments say was poisoned with a nerve agent, could have served as evidence in his case but was instead taken out of Russia by his supporters. 
Navalny's team said on Thursday that the water bottle removed from his hotel room in the city of Tomsk last month had been taken to Germany and found to have traces of Novichok nerve agent.
Asked about the finding, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russian specialists had been unable to examine the bottle and that Moscow was therefore not able to comment. 
""We cannot explain this because, as you know, this bottle -- if it did exist -- was taken away to Germany or somewhere else. So, something that could have become evidence of a poisoning was unfortunately taken out. This (raises) an additional question: why?"" said Peskov. 
""There is too much of the absurd in this story to take anyone's word as fact,"" he added. 
Russia has said it needs to see more evidence before a formal criminal investigation is opened into the Navalny case and has asked Germany to hand over Navalny's medical data so it can be reviewed. 
Though no criminal case has been opened, Navalny's assistant Ilya Pakhomov was questioned by Russian police for over five hours, the head of Navalny's anti-corruption foundation in Moscow, Ivan Zhdanov, told Reuters on Friday.
He said Pakhomov's interrogation was very detailed, with investigators asking questions about Navalny's trip to Tomsk, in which Pakhomov also took part, down to whether there had been intimate relations between members of the group.
Navalny's allies have said a proper investigation into the case will show that the Kremlin, President Vladimir Putin and Russian security services are responsible for poisoning the politician.

The Kremlin has called the accusation groundless, saying it would make no sense for it to poison Navalny and then allow him to travel for medical treatment in another country where the poison would be detected.

The unit's tasks include strategic communications and crisis management during times of natural disaster, emergency and war, as well as identifying ""psychological operations, propaganda and perception operations waged against Turkey"", it said.
President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party, which has ruled Turkey for 18 years, frequently criticises foreign media but has come under criticism for its treatment of journalists at home.
The media watchdog International Press Institute said last year more than 120 journalists were being held in Turkey’s jails and the situation had not improved since the lifting of a two-year state of emergency following a failed 2016 coup.
Hundreds of journalists had faced prosecution since the coup, mainly on terrorism-related charges, the IPI said.
Many Turks have also been charged over social media posts insulting Erdogan or his ministers, or for criticism related to Turkey's military operations in Syria and Iraq and the handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

Cyprus' internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government has long been at loggerheads with Turkey, which began drilling for oil and gas near Cyprus last year.
The dispute stems from overlapping claims to regional waters linked to the split of the island between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in north Cyprus is recognised only by Ankara.
Turkey questions Cyprus' right to explore in the seas around the island because it maintains that the Nicosia administration does not represent the interests of Turkish Cypriots. 
That argument is dismissed by Cyprus, which is legally recognised as representing the entire island.
Friday's announcement came three days after Turkey extended the operations of its Yavuz drill ship off Cyprus until Oct. 12, in a move that Cyprus described as provocative. Greece, also locked in dispute with Turkey over east Mediterreanean waters, expressed concern.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Masks, social distancing and voting were the key themes at New York Fashion Week, as the five-day parade of shows in the COVID-19 era closed on Thursday with designer Christian Siriano presenting his Sarah Jessica Parker-inspired collection at his Connecticut home.
Rebecca Minkoff, who teamed up with U.S. hardware store Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) to show her rock 'n' roll line in a digital presentation, incorporated masks into her show after talking with her casting agent.
""He was like, if one model wants to wear a mask for safety reasons, you better believe that all the others are going to want to,"" said Minkoff. ""It was beautiful. It showcased all the amazing masks we're gonna be launching.""
Minkoff will also be selling t-shirts encouraging U.S. citizens to vote, ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election. Part of the proceeds will go to VoteRunLead, an organization which helps people register to vote and trains women to run for office.
Siriano, meanwhile, featured a dress in a bold vote print fabric and several accessories of hats, gloves and masks.
Minkoff's collection was done before the COVID-19 restrictions, but she decided a digital show was the only way to go.
""The pandemic hit and right away I knew I had till about May to decide what we wanted to do,"" she said.
Minkoff said the brand has seen sales spike over the last few days and that business was up over 7% from last year. Customers still want fashion - even if they're not going out as much, she said.
In place of the traditional runway show many designers, including Tom Ford and Brandon Maxwell, released look books in order to debut their new lines.

The 91-year-old emir arrived in the United States in July to complete medical treatment, the Kuwaiti state news agency said at the time, adding that he was in stable condition after having undergone successful surgery in July.
The emir's eldest son, Sheikh Nasser Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, accepted the award on behalf of his father at a private ceremony with Trump on Friday.
The White House praised the emir as an ""unwavering friend and partner to the United States"" who gave ""indispensable support to the United States throughout Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and the Defeat-ISIS campaign.""
Operation Iraqi Freedom refers to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq to oust former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein; Operation Enduring Freedom to the 2001 U.S.-led military operation that drove the Taliban from power in Afghanistan; and the Defeat-ISIS campaign to the coalition effort to end the Islamic State militant group's control of territory in Syria and Iraq.
The White House described the award given to the Kuwaiti emir on Friday as a rare, prestigious decoration that can only be bestowed by the president, typically to foreign heads of state or government.
On Monday, Kuwait's prime minister told the Kuwaiti cabinet of the improvement of the emir's health.
In July, Kuwait's cabinet tweeted that the emir arrived at Rochester airport in the United States, without specifying which U.S. city of that name. The main campus of the Mayo Clinic, among the top U.S. medical centers, is in Rochester, Minnesota.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, two sources familiar with the matter said the emir is being treated at the Mayo Clinic. The clinic referred queries to the Kuwaiti government, which issued a statement largely echoing the White House's comments about the emir receiving the award.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations agreed on Friday to step up monitoring of reported rights abuses during Belarus's crackdown on protests, angering Minsk and its ally Moscow and raising the diplomatic stakes in the crisis.
During a highly charged debate at the U.N. Human Rights Council, European ministers denounced the repression of demonstrations since Belarus's Aug 9. elections, and Britain's envoy said it would support sanctions. Belarus said the Council's decision on monitoring set ""a dangerous precedent"".
U.N. rights investigator Anaïs Marin earlier told a meeting of the Council that states needed to act to prevent a major geopolitical rift. ""Let's not allow another Iron Curtain to descend on the European continent,"" she said.
Marin said more than 10,000 people have been ""abusively arrested"", with more than 500 reports of torture and thousands ""savagely beaten"", since President Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory in the vote.
Protesters say the election was fraudulent. Lukashenko says he won the vote fairly by a landslide and dismisses accusations of abuses as part of a Western smear campaign. 
In Belarus, detained opposition politician and prominent protest leader Maxim Znak started a hunger strike in jail on Friday, the opposition Coordination Council said.
There were no reports of big demonstrations in Minsk, though the opposition has announced marches for Saturday and Sunday.
A man set himself on fire outside a police station in the town of Smolevichi on Friday, the interior ministry said, though it was not immediately clear if that was linked to the unrest. The ministry said the man had a history of mental illness.
""IT IS HEARTBREAKING""
The U.N. debate in Geneva, called to vote on an EU proposal for increased monitoring, was interrupted repeatedly by the delegations of Belarus, Russia, China and Venezuela raising procedural objections. 
Russia - there as an observer without voting rights - proposed 17 amendments to the motion, but they were all rejected.
The council agreed - with 23 votes in favour, two against (Venezuela, Eritrea) and 22 abstentions - to give the office of U.N. rights boss Michelle Bachelet a mandate to monitor the situation in Belarus and submit an oral report with recommendations by the end of the year.
The Belarus Foreign Ministry described the vote as a ""dangerous precedent"" and accused the Council of meddling in its internal affairs.
Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya had earlier called in a video message for the monitoring mission, but said she was still open to talks with the government to try and resolve the crisis.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, Lukashenko's main ally, agreed to loan Belarus $1.5 billion at a summit on Monday, and the two countries are conducting joint military training exercises in Belarus.
Russia's defence ministry said on Friday that special forces from Russia and Belarus had rehearsed a counter-terrorism scenario involving freeing hostages from a building in their ""Slavic Brotherhood 2020"" drills.
It said more than 800 military personnel from the two countries were taking part in the training near the Belarusian city of Brest.
During the U.N. debate, Ukraine's foreign minister warned Russia against taking steps that may undermine the sovereignty of Belarus and destabilise the region.
""It is heartbreaking to watch the footage of our close neighbours viciously beaten down and arbitrarily detained on the streets of their native cities,"" Dmytro Kuleba told the debate.
Denmark's foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, said the situation in Belarus had ""deteriorated alarmingly"" in recent months. 
Wendy Morton, Britain's junior foreign minister, told the talks: ""The UK also supports sanctions against those responsible. We are working with our international partners to hold the Belarusian authorities to account.""
Internal divisions have up to now hampered an EU push to impose sanctions on Belarus.

MADRID (Reuters) - The regional government of the Spanish capital Madrid ordered a lockdown from Monday in some of the poorer areas of the city and its outskirts that are home to about 850,000 people, after a surge in coronavirus infections there.
Regional leader Isabel Diaz Ayuso said on Friday movement between and within areas in six districts would be restricted, but people would be able to go to work in Spain's hardest-hit region.
Residents in Madrid's poorer districts had said they felt abandoned, stigmatised and feared new restrictions would deprive them of income. 
Ayuso, who attracted criticism for saying this week ""the way of life of immigrants"" was partly to blame for the rise in cases, said the areas had been chosen because contagion levels there exceeded 1,000 per 100,000 people.
""We need to avoid lockdown, we need to avoid economic disaster,"" Ayuso told a news conference. ""We don't think it's time to restrict all citizens, but rather to apply measures in areas we have perfectly identified.""
Access to parks and public areas will be restricted, gatherings will be limited to six people and commercial establishments will have to close by 10 p.m. in the areas.
INEQUALITY GAP
The gap between poorer and richer areas is at the heart of a debate over how to curb an increase in new cases.
Restrictions will affect Vallecas, a southern district with a lower average income and higher immigrant population, which has one of the highest infection rates in Madrid. It is almost six times higher than in Chamberi, one of the wealthier, northern districts. 
The health system ""is more paralysed here, they have us out here waiting, crowded, queues everywhere,"" retiree Mari Paz Gonzalez said. ""We are abandoned... They left us in the hands of God.""
""As soon as you cross that bridge things change. As soon as you cross it the neighbourhood changes,"" retiree Carmen Ibarra said, walking through Vallecas.
The inequality gap and its correlation to coronavirus infection rates are also a hot political issue in Barcelona, the second-largest city.
Some 640,040 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Spain, health authorities said on Friday, with a rise of 4,697 in the past 24 hours. 
The health ministry data showed an increase of 14,389 compared with figures released on Thursday, but this included retrospective cases dating back a number of days. 

Nearly 30,500 people have now died from COVID-19 in Spain.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - The Indian army launched disciplinary proceedings against an unspecified number of soldiers following an inquiry into the killing of three suspected militants in the northern state of Kashmir, the army said on Friday.
A defense spokesman said evidence showed soldiers had exceeded their powers under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which grants the army broad authority including shoot-to-kill powers.
In July the army said it had killed the three men in an operation against militants in the Shopian district of Kashmir.
The families of the slain men said security forces had killed them in cold blood. The army said it was still investigating the dead men's ties to militant groups.
""The inquiry has brought out certain prima facie evidence indicating that during the operation, powers vested under the AFSPA 1990 were exceeded,"" Rajesh Kalia, a Srinagar-based defense spokesman, said. 
""Consequently, the competent disciplinary authority has directed to initiate disciplinary proceedings under the Army Act against those found prima-facie answerable.""

LONDON (Reuters) - A lawyer for Julian Assange told a London court on Friday that she was present when an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump offered to arrange a pardon for the WikiLeaks founder in return for information that would ""benefit President Trump politically"".
Australian-born Assange, 49, is fighting to avoid being sent to the United States, where he is charged with conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law over the release of confidential cables by WikiLeaks in 2010-2011. 
His lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, said in a witness statement to the court that she observed a meeting at the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2017 between Assange and Republican then-U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher.
She said Rohrabacher and an assistant offered to arrange a pardon for Assange in return for information about the hacking of Democratic emails before the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
""They stated that President Trump was aware of and had approved of them coming to meet with Mr Assange to discuss a proposal – and that they would have an audience with the President to discuss the matter on their return to Washington DC,"" she said.
""The proposal put forward by Congressman Rohrabacher was that Mr. Assange identify the source for the 2016 election publications in return for some form of pardon, assurance or agreement, which would both benefit President Trump politically and prevent U.S. indictment and extradition,"" Robinson said.
Assange's legal team first said at hearings in February that Rohrabacher had conveyed a pardon offer to Assange. At the time, the White House called the assertion that Trump had tried to reach a deal with Assange ""a complete fabrication and a total lie"".
Rohrabacher said he had never spoken with the president about Assange, denied being sent on Trump’s behalf and said he was acting on his own when he offered to ask Trump for a pardon for Assange.
Robinson said Rohrabacher's offer was presented to Assange as a ""win-win"" solution that would allow Assange ""to get on with his life"" and in return would also politically benefit Trump.
During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, WikiLeaks published a series of Democratic National Committee emails damaging to candidate Hillary Clinton. U.S. investigators have concluded that the emails were hacked by Russia as part of an effort to influence the election.
The 2016 election leaks are not directly a part of the U.S. criminal case against Assange, which covers secret military and diplomatic documents published by WikiLeaks several years earlier.
Russia has denied meddling in the 2016 election and Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Moscow.
Assange is fighting the U.S. extradition request, arguing that the Trump administration has brought charges against him for political reasons.

In 2012, Assange took refuge in Ecuador’s London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden where he was accused of sex crimes, which he denied and which were later dropped. After seven years, he was dragged from the embassy by British police in 2019.

Polish media reported on Friday that Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, leader of the United Poland party, could lose his post next week. Ziobro is the architect of judicial reforms which critics say increase political control over the courts and which have put Poland into conflict with the European Union. 
The biggest ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), was angered by the failure of Ziobro's party, and a second coalition partner, Accord, to support an animal rights bill, though tensions between the parties have been simmering for some time as they jostle for position after a run of election victories. 
""Any attempt to dismiss the minister of justice means elections,"" said United Poland lawmaker Janusz Kowalski.
""Elections that are a gift for (the liberal, main opposition) Civic Platform...,"" he added.
At stake is not only the stability of the government, but also the direction Poland will take in its relations with the European Union.
Ziobro's ultra-conservative United Poland favours a more combative stance on issues such as judicial reforms and gay rights than more moderate figures in PiS centred around Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
Proposed by PiS party leader and well-known cat lover Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the package of animal rights laws passed early on Friday thanks to opposition support, while most United Poland lawmakers opposed it and Accord largely abstained.
The package is seen as an attempt by PiS to reach out to younger voters. But some in the coalition felt the measures, which ban fur farming and the ritual slaughter of animals for the export of halal and kosher meat, would alienate voters in PiS's rural heartlands and hurt farmers.
PiS deputy spokesman Radoslaw Fogiel said the problems in the ruling camp went deeper than current policy differences.
""A coalition can work when all the entities that make it up have a common goal, when they agree to act together and go in the same direction,"" he said.

318,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>",New Jersey governor signs law aimed at protecting poor from pollution,"By Maria Caspani
(Reuters) - A landmark environmental justice bill stalled for over a decade became law in New Jersey on Friday.
Signed by Democratic Governor Phil Murphy, the legislation seeks to curb new sources of pollution, including sewage treatment plants, landfills and incinerators that have affected certain communities more than others. 
Seeing the law enacted was a long-fought dream for Ana Baptista, an assistant professor at The New School in New York City. 
""When this bill was finally passed, I had a moment where I just had to shed a tear of disbelief,"" said Baptista, who grew up in Newark, where the polluted Ironbound neighborhood is located. The Ironbound is home to New Jersey’s largest garbage incinerator and more than 100 sites https://ironboundcc.org/our-community contaminated by dangerous chemicals, including dioxin and pesticides.
The passage of New Jersey’s law comes as the Democratic Party has elevated the issue of environmental justice, tying it to proposed policies to combat climate change and economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis.
Neighborhoods like the Ironbound populated by low-income, immigrant or minority communities have historically faced disproportionate environmental hazards, as zoning practices placed these communities near high-polluting industries or in other less-desirable locations, said Mustafa Santiago Ali, a former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency official who is now vice president of environmental justice, climate, and community revitalization at the National Wildlife Federation. 
""Folks don't by accident end up in these communities,"" Ali said. ""We have traditionally pushed people into certain areas, or we've chosen those areas that we don't place a lot of value on to put certain things."" 
SEIZE THE MOMENT 
Nationwide protests over racial injustice and the COVID-19 pandemic were catalysts for the bill's passage last month, advocates said. 
Evidence that linked air pollution to severe cases of coronavirus and the outsized toll on Black communities ""added fuel to the fire,"" Melissa Miles, executive director of the New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance, told Reuters. ""We finally had the political climate to get this bill passed.""
Activists hope New Jersey's law will encourage other states to pass similar bills, after the federal government under Republican President Donald Trump has rolled back numerous environmental regulations.
For example, changes in July to the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) limit the scope of environmental impact assessments for proposed projects, and exempt some projects altogether. 
While industries, including oil and gas as well as construction, had long argued that the permitting process took too long, activists say the recent changes could have consequences for the health of low-income, minority communities.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has pledged to advance environmental justice as part of his $2 trillion plan for combating climate change by directing clean energy spending toward communities living in the shadow of refineries and power plants. 
Other U.S. states, including California and New York, have also enacted environmental justice legislation, but activists say New Jersey's is considered the most ambitious. 
Among the New Jersey law's provisions, the state's Department of Environmental Protection would be required to deny permit applications for a new project if it determines it will have a disproportionate impact on a certain community already facing environmental or health stressors. Under the law, the department can also set conditions for the expansion of an existing facility or a permit renewal.
Some state business leaders have objected to the law, saying it would stunt economic activity and discourage investment and job growth. 
""The problem with (bill) S-232 is many of its requirements range between extremely onerous to simply unattainable,"" Ray Cantor, the vice president of government affairs for the New Jersey Business & Industry Association, wrote in an opinion article https://www.njspotlight.com/2020/07/op-ed-this-burdensome-bill-would-shut-down-economic-opportunities-in-njs-urban-areas earlier this year.
Experts say the law could spark legal challenges.
Highly polluted sites along New Jersey's Atlantic coastline may also face threats related to climate change and increased flooding from the rise of sea levels. 
New Jersey has the most hazardous sites, 36, at risk of coastal flooding by 2040 of all U.S. states, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.

""We're going to feel the effects of climate change very severely, and we know that overburdened communities ... are going to feel those impacts even worse,"" Baptista said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has endorsed a new army chief from his own King's Guard faction in an annual reshuffle of defence personnel, the government said in a statement on Friday.
Armed forces reshuffles in Thailand are scrutinised carefully for signs of which military factions are in the ascendancy in a country where there have been 13 successful coups since the end of absolute royal rule in 1932.
According to the official Royal Gazette, General Narongpan Jittkaewtae, an assistant army chief, was appointed Army Chief, succeeding General Apirat Kongsompong, who becomes Deputy of the Lord Chamberlain, a prominent role in the royal household.
Narongpan, 57, was handpicked by Apirat from within the King's Guard faction.
A 2014 coup has strengthened the military's political clout, with junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha remaining prime minister after an election last year, an outcome that critics say was made possible by amending the constitution. Prayuth insists the process was fair. 
Narongpan takes the helm at a critical time for the military, with almost daily rallies since mid-July taking aim at its entrenched political influence, stirring memories of nearly a decade of on-off protests during which two coups took place.
The recent demonstrations have also seen some unprecedented, taboo-breaking calls for reform of the role of the monarchy, an institution that successive military commanders have sworn to protect. 
A major anti-government protest is planned this weekend, which organisers expect could draw tens of thousands of people.
The new army chief is a private person not known for commenting on politics, or the ongoing anti-government protests, according to Thai defence reporters who spoke to Reuters. 

Other important appointments from Oct. 1 include General Chalermpol Srisawasdi, chief of staff of the armed forces, who becomes supreme commander, Admiral Chatchai Srivorakhan, who was promoted to Navy Chief, and Air Chief Marshal Airbull Suttiwan, an air force specialist, who becomes Air Force Chief.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's Congress is set to vote on Friday over whether to oust President Martín Vizcarra after impeachment proceedings were launched last week, a bid that has roiled the copper-producing country but has appeared to lose steam in recent days.
Vizcarra, or a lawyer on his behalf, will mount a defense to lawmakers after they voted to impeach the centrist leader on grounds of ""moral incapacity"" over alleged links to an case of irregular government contracts with a little-known singer.
However, despite simmering anger in the Andean country, which is facing a sharp economic contraction and one of the world's most severe coronavirus outbreaks, the bid to oust him has faltered with key opposition lawmakers rejecting the plan.
The opposition-dominated Congress must gather at least 87 votes out of 130 lawmakers to remove 57-year-old Vizcarra, who does not have his own party representation in the legislature. A vote to start impeachment proceedings gained 65 votes.
""Let's not get distracted by secondary, banal things. Peru has so many problems to be distracted by sterile discussions,"" Vizcarra told state television at an event on Thursday.
If Vizcarra were ousted, the presidency would be assumed by the head of Congress, Manuel Merino.
Vizcarra has claimed that the move is a plot by Congress, which was elected in January after the president dissolved the previous parliament last year in the middle of a fight with the opposition over his anti-corruption reforms.
A recent Ipsos poll showed that 79% of Peruvians would prefer Vizcarra to fulfill his mandate, which runs until elections in April next year, in which he is not running.
Peru, the world's second largest copper producer, has a history of political turmoil, with three attempts to impeach a sitting president in the last five years.

In a joint appearance with newly elected Surinamese President Chan Santokhi on Thursday, Pompeo contrasted ""the quality of the products and services of American private companies"" with Chinese companies, which he said often do not compete on a ""fair and equitable basis."" 
""We've watched the Chinese Communist Party invest in countries, and it all seems great at the front end and then it all comes falling down when the political costs connected to that becomes clear,"" Pompeo said. 
His comments came after a string of oil discoveries off the coast of Suriname, whose trade ties with China grew under the small South American country's former President Desi Bouterse, a military strongman who oversaw an economic collapse and lost a re-election bid to Santokhi earlier this year.
China lent and invested heavily in resource-rich Latin America during the decade-long commodities boom that largely came to a close in 2014. The Trump administration has sought to highlight the heavy debts and economic deterioration those ties have left for close Chinese trade partners like Venezuela and Ecuador. 
In its statement, the Chinese embassy to Paramaribo said, ""any attempt to sow discord between China and Suriname is doomed to fail.
""We advise Mr. Pompeo to respect facts and truth, abandon arrogance and prejudice, stop smearing and spreading rumors about China,"" the embassy said. 
Santokhi told reporters on Thursday that Suriname's relationship with China was not a topic of conversation in his meeting with Pompeo. 

""It is not a question of making choices,"" he said.

TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Taiwan scrambled fighter jets on Friday as 18 Chinese aircraft buzzed the island, crossing the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait, in response to a senior U.S. official holding talks in Taipei.
China had earlier announced combat drills and denounced what it called collusion between the island, which it claims as part of its territory, and the United States.
U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach arrived in Taipei on Thursday for a three-day visit, the most senior State Department official to come to Taiwan in four decades - to which China had promised a ""necessary response.""
The U.S. State Department has said Krach, who arrived in Taipei on Thursday afternoon, is in Taiwan for a memorial service on Saturday for former President Lee Teng-hui, who was revered by many on the island and internationally as the father of Taiwan's democracy.
But Beijing has watched with growing alarm the ever-closer relationship between Taipei and Washington, and has stepped up military exercises near the island, including two days of large-scale air and sea drills last week.
With a U.S. presidential election looming in November, Sino-U.S. relations are already under huge strain from a trade war, U.S. digital security concerns and the coronavirus pandemic.
Taiwan said 18 Chinese aircraft were involved on Friday, far more than in previous such encounters. 
""Sep. 18, two H-6 bombers, eight J-16 fighters, four J-10 fighters and four J-11 fighters crossed the midline of the TaiwanStrait and entered Taiwan's southwest ADIZ,"" the defence ministry said in an English-language tweet.
""ROCAF scrambled fighters, and deployed air defence missile system to monitor the activities."" The ROCAF, Taiwan's air force, has scrambled frequently in recent months in response to Chinese intrusions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has led the Trump administration's rhetorical offensive against China, accused Beijing of bluster when asked about the Chinese activity.
""We sent the delegation to a funeral, and the Chinese have apparently responded by military blustering. I'll leave it at that,"" he told a news conference on a visit to Guyana.
The ministry showed a map of the flight paths of Chinese jets crossing the Taiwan Strait midline, which combat aircraft from both sides normally avoid passing through.
Taiwan's Liberty Times newspaper said Taiwanese jets had scrambled 17 times over four hours, warning China's air force to stay away.
It also showed a picture of missiles being loaded onto an F-16 fighter at the Hualien air base on Taiwan's east coast.
'REASONABLE, NECESSARY ACTION'
In Beijing, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said Friday's maneuvers, about which he gave no details, involved the People's Liberation Army's eastern theater command.
""They are a reasonable, necessary action aimed at the current situation in the Taiwan Strait and protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Ren said.
He said Taiwan was a purely internal Chinese affair and accused its ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) of stepping up ""collusion"" with the United States.
Trying to ""use Taiwan to control China"" or ""rely on foreigners to build oneself up"" was wishful thinking and futile. ""Those who play with fire will get burnt,"" Ren said.
Taiwan's presidential office urged China to exercise restraint, and urged the Taiwanese not to be alarmed, saying the military had a grasp on the situation.
Government officials in Taiwan, including President Tsai Ing-wen, have expressed concern in recent weeks that an accidental military encounter could spark a wider conflict.
Hu Xijin, editor of China's widely read state-backed Global Times tabloid, wrote on his Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) microblog that the drills were preparation for an attack on Taiwan should the need arise, and that they enabled intelligence-gathering about Taiwan's defense systems.
""If the U.S. secretary of state or defence secretary visits Taiwan, People's Liberation Army fighters should fly over Taiwan island, and directly exercise in the skies above it,"" he added.
Chinese fighter jets briefly crossed the midline of the Taiwan Strait last month while U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar was in Taipei, and last week China carried out two days of large-scale drills off Taiwan's southwestern coast.
The United States, like most countries, has official ties only with China, not Taiwan, though Washington is the island's main arms supplier and most important international backer.

This week, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations had lunch with Taiwan's top envoy in New York. China's U.N. mission said it had lodged ""stern representations"" over the meeting.

The female patient, suffering from a life-threatening illness, had to be turned away on the night of Sept. 11 by the city's University Clinic and died after the ambulance carrying her was diverted to Wuppertal, 30 km (20 miles) away.
Prosecutor Christoph Hebbecker, head of the cybercrime unit in Cologne, said he had opened an investigation into negligent homicide against unknown persons, the Kolner-Stadtanzeiger daily reported. Hebbecker could not be reached for comment.
If the investigation leads to a prosecution, it would be the first confirmed case in which a person has died as the direct consequence of a cyber attack.
The University Clinic in Duesseldorf, capital of Germany's most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, was hit by a ransomware attack on Sept. 10 that penetrated its systems via a flaw in a Citrix VPN system.
The hospital's IT operations remain affected and it is still unable to admit patients brought in by ambulance, it said on Friday.
Germany's cyber-security agency, the Federal Office for Information Security, was called in to shore up the hospital's systems. Its chief, Arne Schoenbohm, said the Citrix flaw had been known about since Dec. 2019 and called on healthcare facilities not to delay IT security upgrades.
""I can only urge you not to ignore or postpone such warnings but to take appropriate action immediately,"" Schoenbohm said in a statement. ""This incident shows once again how seriously this danger must be taken.""
Ciaran Martin, who stepped down as the head of Britain's National Cyber Security Centre this month, said the incident could be prove to be first death caused by a cyberattack.
""If confirmed, this tragedy would be the first case I know of, anywhere in the world, where the death of a human life can be linked in any way to a cyberattack,"" he told an event in London.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union wants to raise more money to shore up its supplies of potential COVID-19 vaccines after estimating that the number of shots available next year around the world might fall short of demand, two EU sources said.
The possible move by the wealthy EU could weaken a global procurement effort co-led by the World Health Organization and further limit the vaccines available to poorer countries, even though the bloc has publicly championed the sharing of COVID-19 vaccines among the entire global population.
The EU executive, the European Commission, told a meeting of EU ambassadors last week that it was ""trying to be pragmatic as the total number of vaccines that could be produced globally next year is 2.4 billion,"" one of the EU sources told Reuters. 
The WHO scheme, called COVAX, wants to secure 2 billion doses by the end of 2021 and many countries, most of them wealthy nations such as the United States, are in a race to ensure they have their own supplies of potential vaccines.
According to the Commission's estimate, demand could far outstrip supply next year. Global coronavirus cases exceeded 30 million on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally, and the pandemic shows no signs of slowing. 
As part of its new push, the Commission is urging the 27 EU member states' governments to back negotiations with a seventh vaccine maker, the two sources said, after it reached deals with AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) and announced advanced talks with Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ),  Moderna  (O:MRNA),  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and CureVac (O:CVAC) for their potential COVID-19 shots.
The Commission told the member states' ambassadors that this new effort would require a top-up of an EU emergency fund which has so far made available about 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) to buy COVID-19 vaccines, the sources said.
At the meeting, the envoys supported the plan to boost the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI) but talks on how much each EU government should chip in are still under way, they said.
""Member states are aware that they can make additional contributions to the ESI if we want to extend the portfolio, as there is only a finite amount of funding available for the ESI,"" a Commission spokesman said on Friday, but declined to give further details.
During a video conference of EU health ministers on Sept. 4, the German government, which holds the EU presidency for the second half of this year, estimated that an additional 750 million euros would be needed to develop existing vaccine candidates, according to minutes of the meeting seen by Reuters.
The EU money is used for down payments to vaccine makers and covers mostly development and production costs. Under the deals negotiated by Brussels, EU states are in exchange granted the right to buy a pre-agreed amount of doses at a set price.
While the initial payment would be lost if a vaccine proved ineffective or dangerous, the deals allow the EU to secure doses in advance with a commitment to make the larger payments at a later stage if vaccines are successful.
In August, the Commission paid AstraZeneca 336 million euros to secure under these conditions 300 million doses of its vaccine under development with an option to buy other 100 million shots.
Brussels has already secured, or is negotiating the supply of, nearly 2 billion doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines from six companies with unspecified delivery dates, according to public figures. 
That is the same amount of vaccines that the WHO is committed to buying through its COVAX facility in 2021 and distribute among all countries in the world.
The Commission has privately warned EU governments not to buy vaccines through COVAX, European officials have told Reuters, as the global procurement scheme could result in the EU having a small share of shots as its population is only 450 million of the world's nearly 8 billion people.
However, the EU has publicly said it wants to boost the production capacity of vaccine makers and share any excess doses with poorer nations. It is also one of the largest donors to the WHO for securing vaccines.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission pledged on Friday to take tougher action against member states failing to fully implement EU anti-racism laws, in a move reflecting global outrage at police violence against African Americans in the United States.
Launching its first anti-racism action plan, the Commission said the initiative allows so-called infringement actions, a process that can involve the Commission taking an offending country to the EU Court of Justice.
""We know that progress to fight racism and hate in Europe is not good enough,"" Vera Jourova, the EU Commission's vice-president for values and transparency, told reporters in Brussels. ""The protests sent a clear message – change must happen now.""
It is a ""moment of reckoning"" for Europeans, where racism can no longer be ignored, she said. 
The May 25 death of black American George Floyd in police custody has led to weeks of protests in the United States against racism and policy brutality, and prompted more European citizens to challenge discrimination in society.
Under the plan, the 27 EU nations would face closer scrutiny, investigations and possible infringement procedures if the European measures are not correctly applied.
The Commission has also called for a ""new approach on equality data collection"" to get a better picture of discrimination in Europe and to push the bloc to collect data about racial or ethnic origin.
The EU Commission also plans to review its existing rules to guarantee they are strict enough and possibly present new legal measures in the next five years.
EU institutions, including the Commission and European Central Bank, have themselves come under fire from critics for being excessively white and sometimes racist. 

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament in June that she was aware of the lack of black staff and commissioners in the bloc’s executive.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Dozens of people in Hong Kong braved heavy rain on Friday evening to write postcards to 12 fugitives arrested by China at sea last month to offer comfort during the upcoming mid-Autumn festival.
The 12 were arrested on Aug. 23 for illegal entry into mainland Chinese waters after setting off from Hong Kong in a boat bound for self-ruled Taiwan.
All were suspected of committing crimes in Hong Kong related to the anti-government protests that erupted last year. Ten had been charged, released on bail and not allowed to leave Hong Kong, and all are now being detained in neighbouring Shenzhen.
On Friday, activists set up booths in two districts to collect postcards, with several dozen passing through to leave their messages.
""The security agency will see this postcard, but I don't care,"" wrote recent university graduate Zol Chan, 22, on her card. ""Please take care of yourselves.""
""Seeing their mothers crying in their press conference, I feel heartbroken and sad,"" she said later. Relatives of some of the detainees held a news conference on Saturday to demand their urgent return and plead for them to be allowed to call home and consult lawyers appointed by the families and not the Chinese government.
As he wrote his message, university student Raymond Cho, 19, said he felt a responsibility to tell them ""that there are still a lot of us who care about them"".
Ten of the detainees had been charged with offences such as manufacturing explosives, arson, rioting or assaulting police. 
One other was suspected of colluding with foreign forces under a national security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in June. 
It is unclear whether authorities will allow the postcards to reach the detainees. This year, the mid-Autumn festival, a full moon harvest celebration across Asia, falls on Oct. 1, China's national day. 
Police in Shenzhen said on Sunday they were suspected of illegal entry, their first public comment on the matter. The same day, China's foreign ministry labelled the group as ""separatists"".

On Tuesday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam voiced discontent with the group being characterised by some as ""democratic activists being oppressed"", saying they were running away from law. Lam said they would have to be ""dealt with"" by mainland authorities, but pledged to provide ""feasible"" assistance.

CAIRO (Reuters) - At the Pyramids of Giza, just a handful of tourists walks among the ancient wonders. Twelve people showed up to admire Luxor's towering colonnades the day it reopened this month. At Egypt's Red Sea resorts, visitor numbers are well below previous years.
Even as international flights and tourist spots open up and Egypt's coronavirus cases remain in check, officials, hotel owners and tour guides concede that the key winter season starting in October is going to be tough.
That could be bad news for the economy. Tourism accounts for up to 15% of Egypt's national output, and officials said it was losing around $1 billion each month after the sector all but shut down from March as the coronavirus pandemic struck.
Egyptian officials say they are making every effort to reassure tourists about their safety and encourage them to visit in the hope that the sector revives gradually.
Egypt is not alone in seeing tourism slump, but it takes a heavy toll on a country that has tapped the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for $8 billion in new loans this year. 
""We used to see about 50 buses here. Now there are none,"" said Samir, a souvenir trader who has been working at the pyramids south of Cairo for more than 30 years and has been selling his possessions to pay his son's school fees.
""We only had one bus, a week ago, full of Russians. They took some photos and left.""
A showpiece museum next to the pyramids is due to open next year, increasing the need for a rapid recovery in 2021.
Westerners typically flock to Egypt's historic sites and golden sands between October and May to avoid the cold at home and the excessive heat of Egypt's summer.
As the sector gears up, hotel resorts are operating at below half capacity and major sites remain virtually empty, tourist workers and official said.
Some 220,000 tourists have visited the Red Sea province and South Sinai - home to the Sharm el-Sheikh resort - since July 1, less than 10% of last year's levels, said Ghada Shalaby, a deputy minister at the ministry of tourism and antiquities.
NILE CRUISES
Shalaby said visitors were gradually returning to the coastal resorts, but people's safety took priority over boosting tourism numbers.
Hotels currently have capacity capped at 50% in line with health regulations. 
Occupancy at Sharm el-Sheikh is 30-35% and in Egypt's Red Sea Governorate and the resort of Hurghada it is 35-45%, a tourism ministry official said.
As sites in Luxor, across the River Nile from the Valley of the Kings, reopened on Sept. 1, a single group of 12 tourists showed up on a visit from Hurghada, said Tharwat Agamy, head of the regional branch of the Egyptian Travel Agents Association. A few more have visited the city daily since then.
Nile cruises are due to restart in October, but there is little expectation that bookings will pick up without a return of charter flights.
""We hope that next year tourism will be working,"" said Agamy.
The state has moved to protect the sector with emergency funding, and more than 9,000 registered tour guides will receive 500 pounds ($32) monthly until the end of the year. Tourism firms are pleading for exemptions on some fees to be extended.
Mohamed Othman, who owns a Nile cruise boat and a hotel and markets cultural tourism in southern Egypt, said he was hopeful for some bookings in November, and reopening sent an important signal, even if ""an influx won't happen overnight"". 
Officially recorded coronavirus cases have fallen to under 200 daily from highs of about 1,500 daily in mid-June. 
Officials say tourist sites and hotels are subject to strict controls. Those entering the country are required to take PCR tests. But the European Union has not added Egypt to its safe travel list.
""We are sparing no effort to ensure that all measures are in place for the return of tourism to the maximum possible capacity and to spread reassurance to the tourists,"" said Shalaby.
At Cairo's Khan al Khalili market, a popular tourist shopping spot, many stores are shuttered. 

""There is no one,"" said Sayed Abel Khaleq, a silver shop owner.

NATO members Turkey and Greece bitterly disagree over maritime jurisdiction and energy exploration rights in the eastern Mediterranean and tensions flared last month when Turkey sent Oruc Reis to waters also claimed by Greece.
On Sunday the Oruc Reis seismic survey vessel returned to port for what Ankara called routine maintenance, a move Greece said was a positive first step in easing tensions.
""Let's give diplomacy a chance, let's put forth a positive approach for diplomacy. Greece should also positively meet this approach of ours, and let's take a step accordingly,"" Erdogan said in Istanbul after Friday prayers. ""This is why we did it.""
""But this does not mean that because Oruc Reis was pulled back for maintenance, our seismic activities will fully stop,"" he told reporters. ""Once the maintenance period is finished, Oruc Reis will go back to its operations again and continue its work there.""
Erdogan said he was ready to discuss the issue with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in person or via videoconference. 
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday that maintenance work on Oruc Reis may take ""a few weeks"".
Turkish and Greek officials have been holding talks at NATO to avoid military accidents, after a minor collision of warships last month. They have held four meetings but Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar, in an interview with British broadcaster Channel 4, on Friday accused Greece of slowing down discussions by imposing pre-conditions.

European Union leaders will evaluate possible sanctions against Turkey at a summit on Sept. 24-25. Germany wants more time for talks with Turkey while France, Cyprus and Greece demand a punitive response.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's far-right League leader Matteo Salvini staged rallies across Tuscany on Friday, looking to pull off a potentially stunning electoral victory against the left in the picturesque region.
Seven regions are up for grabs in a vote spread over two days on Sept. 20 and 21, with an alliance of rightist parties poised to make a string of gains over Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's ruling coalition members, according to polls.
Underlying the importance of Tuscany, a left-wing stronghold since World War Two, Salvini focused his final campaign efforts on the wealthy region, which is centred on Florence, with six rallies planned through the day accompanied by a media blitz.
""For the first time in 50 years, the battle here is open,"" he told a square full of supporters in Pisa.
Salvini, whose anti-immigrant League is the most popular party in Italy but languishes in opposition, failed in his bid to seize another leftist bastion, Emilia-Romagna, in February. 
But he has toned down his overtly populist rhetoric in recent weeks and presented a youthful image at the polls, putting forward Susanna Ceccardi, 33, as his candidate against the 61-year-old Eugenio Giani, a veteran of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), which forms part of Conte's coalition.
'ENERGY AND DRIVE'
""After the coronavirus crisis, Italy doesn't need to be run by people at the end of their political career. They need energy and drive,"" Salvini said on Friday.
When a blackout was imposed on opinion polls two weeks ago, Giani was a fraction ahead of Ceccardi, but League politicians say they believe the two are now neck-and-neck.
In the other regional races, the right is expected to hold onto Liguria and Veneto and take the central Marche from the centre-left. The PD also risks losing Puglia in the south but should hold onto Campania, which is centred on Naples.
Tuscany is seen as the main battleground, with PD leader Nicola Zingaretti likely to face pressure to step down if the party loses its historic fiefdom, PD insiders say. 
Old party allegiances die hard in Italy and Zingaretti will be hoping they prevail this weekend.

""My family and I vote for the left because it is the lesser evil,"" said Maurizio Pinzi, 56, a petrol pump attendant in the Tuscan town of Montepulciano. ""The League is making gains because the economy is going badly, but Salvini is a loudmouth who only talks about immigrants.""

333,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Referendum and regional votes test Italy's coalition parties,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy holds seven regional elections and a constitutional referendum on Sunday and Monday, with an alliance of rightist parties looking certain to make gains at the expense of divided government partners.
Here is a breakdown of the ballots and some of the key battles to look out for.
WHO CAN VOTE AND WHEN
Voting takes place on Sept. 20 from 7.00 a.m. to 11.00 p.m. (0500-2100 GMT) and again on Sept. 21 from 7.00 a.m. to 3.00 p.m. (0500-1300 GMT). Exit polls on the main races are expected when voting closes on Monday. The referendum ballots will be counted first followed by the regional votes.
The referendum covers the whole nation. 
The regional votes are being held in Tuscany, Puglia, Liguria, Marche, Veneto, Campania and Valle d'Aosta, accounting for some 36% of Italy's 51.56 million voters.
There are also mayoral elections in 962 municipalities, including Venice, Bolzano and Reggio Calabria.
REFERENDUM REDUX
Italians are being asked if they want to reduce the number of lawmakers to 400 from 630 in the lower house and to 200 from 315 in the upper house. The measure has been championed by the co-ruling 5-Star Movement and has lukewarm backing from most other parties. The referendum is expected to pass. If it doesn't, the result would represent a stinging defeat for 5-Star. 
5-Star says the reduction will save Italy money and streamline parliamentary processes. Opponents say the savings will be minimal and warn the cuts will disrupt committee work. If the referendum passes, the electoral system will need to be overhauled.
REGIONAL BATTLEGROUNDS
At present, four of the regions up for grabs are run by the centre-left Democratic Party (Tuscany, Puglia, Marche, Campania) and two by the right (Liguria and Veneto). Valle D'Aosta is an autonomous region with a different party system. 
The right, made up of the League, Brothers of Italy and Forza Italia (Go Italy!), is projected to keep hold of its current regions and looks set to take Marche with relative ease. Puglia is leaning to the right, while the PD should retain Campania.
Most attention is focused on Tuscany, a traditional leftist stronghold. The veteran PD candidate is neck-and-neck with Susanna Ceccardi, 33, a member of Matteo Salvini's League party.
FALLOUT 
Whatever the result, the national government is unlikely to fall, although a rout for coalition parties would put pressure on Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to reshuffle his cabinet. If the PD loses Tuscany, party leader Nicola Zingaretti will come under internal pressure to step down. 

By contrast, Salvini could be weakened within the right if Ceccardi fails to take Tuscany but candidates put forward by the Brothers of Italy win in Marche and Puglia. Surging support for the long-standing League chief in Veneto, Luca Zaia, also means that Salvini is not the undisputed party kingpin.

TRIPOLI, Lebanon (Reuters) - For years, small boats have left northern Lebanon's coast, packed with desperate migrants hoping to reach European shores. Until recently, they carried mostly Syrian and Palestinian refugees. But with Lebanon in freefall, its citizens have begun joining their ranks in larger numbers.
Mohammad Ghandour never thought he'd be one of them. But he said Lebanon's economic crisis, which has crashed the Lebanese pound and left him unable to feed his seven children, gave him no choice. 
""In Lebanon, we are being killed by poverty,"" Ghandour told Reuters this week, from his mother's cramped three-room apartment where he was staying with 12 other family members. He was back in Tripoli, one of Lebanon's poorest cities, after being sent back by Cyprus. 
""This is worse than war … My children will either die on the streets or become criminals to survive.
Ghandour, 37, is one of dozens of Lebanese who've attempted the journey since late August, when rights groups say a rise in the number of boats leaving Lebanon began. Exact figures are hard to come by, but the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has tracked 21 boats leaving Lebanon between July and Sept. 14. The previous year, there were 17 in total.
The increase has worried Cypriot authorities, especially given the global pandemic. The island is the closest European Union member state to the Middle East and has seen a gradual rise in arrivals of undocumented migrants and refugees in the past two years, as other routes have become more difficult to cross. 
After 28 hours lost at sea, Ghandour said his boat, carrying his wife, children and other relatives, arrived on a beach near the seaside resort of Larnaca. He said his family was detained in a camp for several days, tested for Covid-19 and prevented from lodging a formal claim for asylum before being sent back to Lebanon.
""I didn't think they would send us back,"" he said. ""They should have just let us die in the water. It's better than coming back here.""
Cypriot authorities said about 230 Lebanese and Syrians were sent back to Lebanon by sea in early September. They had arrived in Cyprus on five boats during the previous weeks.
""Following our government's orders and after consultations between the two governments (Cyprus and Lebanon) we safely returned them on September 6, 7 and 8,"" Stelios Papatheodorou, chief of the Cypriot police, told Reuters.
He denied accusations that authorities had mistreated them and pushed back their boats.
""We provided them with food and water and covered all their needs at our own expense,"" Papatheodorou said.
Lebanon's General Security and Foreign Ministry did not respond to written requests for comment.
'TREATED LIKE DOGS'
Out of work for three years, Ghandour decided last month to pack up for good and try his luck in Cyprus. He left his apartment, sold his furniture, and had his older sons sell scrap metal to help buy a small boat and supplies for the perilous journey.
Ghandour was one of four migrants interviewed by Reuters, who said they were swiftly sent back to Lebanon. According to UNHCR, the island has pushed back at least five boats, which carried Lebanese, Syrians, Palestinians and others. 
""You can't just summarily send people back without considering their claims fully and fairly,"" said Bill Frelick, the director of the refugee and migrant rights division at HRW, who has been monitoring the returns.
Although Lebanon is not at war and economic hardship is not recognised as grounds for asylum, the multiple crises Lebanon is facing mean some of its nationals and residents could face serious threats, while others could qualify for refugee status on fear-of-persecution grounds, Frelick added.
In interviews with Reuters, migrants said they told Cypriot authorities they feared violence and instability in Lebanon and did not want to return. 
In August a port blast killed nearly 200. 
Migrants also said they encountered aggressive tactics as they neared Cyprus. Chamseddine Kerdi said his boat, packed with 52 people, was encircled several times and ultimately damaged before being towed to shore by authorities. 
""My daughter begged me not to let them kill us,"" Kerdi said. 
Ghandour was not expecting a hostile reception in Cyprus. He had previously tried looking for work in Germany, at the height of the migrant flows to Europe in 2015 and 2016, and said he was greeted with kindness. ""This time, they treated us like dogs.""
Despite this, both Ghandour and Kerdi are adamant they'll set sail again soon.
For others, however, their first journey would be their last. 
Mezhar Abdelhamid Mohammad's son-in-law and nephew left Lebanon 11 days ago in a boat packed with about 50 men, women and children. Adrift for seven days, the boat was eventually rescued by UN peacekeepers off the coast of Lebanon, with only 36 people alive. But the two men weren't on it. 

A survivor who returned to Lebanon told Mohammad that he had jumped in the water with Mohammad's relatives to try and find help. They have not been found.

France has been leaning on Lebanon's sectarian politicians to name a cabinet swiftly and embark on reforms to get the country out of the worst crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.
But the process has been bogged down by a dispute over the allocation of ministries in the new cabinet.
Lebanon's main Shi'ite Muslim factions, Iran-backed Hezbollah and the Amal Movement, have demanded that they name Shi'ite ministers, including the finance minister.
President Michel Aoun, a Christian under Lebanon's sectarian system of power sharing, received a phone call from Macron ""dealing with the government situation and the necessity to continue efforts to secure the creation of the government as soon as possible,"" the Lebanese presidency said. 
Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib, a Sunni Muslim, said on Thursday he would give more time for talks on forming the cabinet. He had proposed switching control of ministries, some of which have been held by the same factions for years.
A Sept. 15 deadline agreed between Lebanese politicians and Paris for forming the new government has already been missed.
Lebanese Christian opposition politician Samir Geagea said on Friday that demands by the Shi'ite groups to name the finance minister in a new government had struck at the core of a French initiative.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A U.N. investigator warned of the possibility of ""another Iron curtain"" descending in Europe during an urgent debate on the human rights situation in Belarus in Geneva on Friday.
The all-day talks, called by Germany on behalf of the European Union (EU), was interrupted repeatedly by the delegations of Belarus, Russia, China and Venezuela raising procedural objections.
The U.N. Human Rights Council will consider a EU draft resolution that call for U.N. rights chief Michelle Bachelet to monitor the crisis and report back by year-end, following what the bloc calls a ""fraudulent election"".
Yury Ambrazevih, Belarus ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, said it was not acceptable to use the body to interfere in a country's election.
President Alexander Lukashenko, in power since 1994, denies rigging the Aug. 9 election, which official results said he won by a landslide. He has cracked down hard on protesters demanding his resignation, the biggest threat to his rule. 
""Let's not allow another Iron curtain to descend on the European continent,"" said Anaïs Marin, U.N. special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Belarus, describing a ""catastrophic"" situation in the country.
More than 10,000 people have been ""abusively arrested"", with more than 500 reports of torture and thousands ""savagely beaten"", Marin said. She called on authorities to release those still held on ""politically-motivated charges"" and for the charges to be dropped.
Marin's speech was interrupted several times by objections from other U.N. members including Russian, Belarusian and other delegations who called a halt to her participation.
Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, in a video message to the 47-member state forum, demanded that authorities end violence against protesters and set up a free and fair presidential election

Vorayuth Yoovidhya was accused of crashing his Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) in 2012 into a policeman, Wichien Klanprasert, and dragging his body for dozens of metres before fleeing.
Authorities in July unexpectedly dropped the case, sparking public anger and prompting a government review.
Prayut Phetkun, a deputy spokesman for the Office of the Attorney-General, said the prosecution order was issued in relation to Vorayuth's previous charge of reckless driving causing death and a new charge of cocaine use. 
""There was evidence that Vorayuth was driving fast and had used drugs before the incident,"" Prayut told Reuters.
The Office of the Attorney-General will ask police to take Vorayuth to court by September, 2022, on the drug use charge and by 2027 on the reckless driving charge, he said.
Vorayuth's lawyer, Samack Chouvaparnante, did not answer telephone calls on Friday seeking comment.
Samack has previously said his client denied all charges. 
Vorayuth missed eight court summonses before authorities issued an arrest warrant five years after the incident. He later disappeared, apparently abroad, according to social media posts.
Last month, a Thai court issued a new arrest warrant.
Vorayuth, the grandson of the late Chaleo Yoovidhya, creator of the Krating Daeng, or Red Bull, energy drink was 27 at the time of the accident.

HONG KONG/SYDNEY (Reuters) - One of the 14 foreign judges on Hong Kong's highest court has resigned due to concerns over a sweeping new national security law imposed by Beijing on the city, Australia's national broadcaster reported on Friday.
The office of the city's leader Carrie Lam confirmed the resignation of Australian judge James Spigelman but did not give a reason.
Spigelman, the former chief justice of New South Wales, is the first senior judge to resign and publicly cite the law, passed by China's parliament on June 30 without any Hong Kong legislative process or consultation.
The Polish-born jurist told the ABC that he had resigned for reasons ""related to the content of the national security legislation"" but did not elaborate further.
Spigelman did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment.
Local and international legal circles have been alarmed at Beijing's imposition of the security law, fearing it erodes the former British colony's autonomy and freedoms.
Under the security legislation, Lam has the right to select judges for a panel of jurists to handle national security cases. In the most serious cases, suspects can also be taken to mainland China for trial in its courts, which are ultimately controlled by the Communist Party.
It also grants extensive powers to personnel from mainland China's security apparatus, who are now based in the city for the first time under the law.
""Mr Justice Spigelman tendered to the Chief Executive on 2 September his resignation as a Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal, therefore the Chief Executive revoked his appointment in accordance with the relevant legislation,"" Lam's office responded in an email to queries about his departure.
Spigelman had been re-appointed to another three-year term last year.
Foreign judges have long been a symbol of the city's rule of law, helping to replace the role of the Privy Council in London after Britain handed the city back to Chinese rule in 1997.
Hong Kong's mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, enshrines the independence of the judiciary and states that judges may come from other common law jurisdictions. 
But Lam and her officials have in recent weeks stressed that the city had no ""separation of powers"", and that the powers of its executive, legislature and judiciary all derived from Beijing.
Even before new laws were enacted, senior judges had told Reuters the independence of Hong Kong’s judicial system was under assault from the Communist Party leadership in Beijing.
Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong law school and a barrister, on Friday urged the government to name the judges cleared for national security work to stop possible speculation that foreign jurists were not welcome.
""The ball is clearly now in the government's court to assure the public it still supports the system of foreign judges on Hong Kong's apex court,"" he said.
Senior barristers said they believed other senior judges were now considering their futures. 
In July, the president of the UK Supreme Court said it was in discussions with the British government to assess the future of UK judges on Hong Kong's top court. Robert Reed, who also serves on the Hong Kong court, said the new law ""contains a number of provisions which give rise to concerns"".

KIGALI (Reuters) - Paul Rusesabagina, depicted in a Hollywood movie as a hero who helped save Tutsis during the Rwandan genocide, said he believed he was flying to Burundi at the invitation of a pastor, but was instead lured to Rwanda and arrested on terrorism charges.
Rusesabagina was speaking to the New York Times in an interview the paper said had been authorised by the Rwandan government and had taken place in the presence of government officials. 
The 66-year-old political dissident and former hotel manager was propelled to fame after the Oscar-nominated film ""Hotel Rwanda"" portrayed him using his connections with the Hutu elite to protect Tutsis fleeing slaughter during the 1994 genocide. 
He had been living in exile for more than a decade, where he was a prominent critic of President Paul Kagame, accusing him of stifling political opposition. 
Rusesabagina suddenly appeared in custody in Rwanda earlier this month, prompting accusations from his family that he had been kidnapped. But he says he voluntarily boarded a private plane in Dubai that he believed was bound for Bujumbura, Burundi, where he had planned to speak to churches at the invitation of a local pastor.
Instead, he landed in Kigali, where he now faces 13 charges, including terrorism, complicity in murder and forming or joining an irregular armed group.
A spokesman for the prosecution on Wednesday told Reuters that Rusesabagina, who once called for armed resistance to the government in a YouTube video, faces a possible life sentence. 

He was denied bail on Thursday and will stay in jail for 30 days as the prosecution ends its investigations.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is pressing ahead with legislation on trade despite a warning from Brussels that it could wreck their future relationship and an acknowledgement by his government that it violates international law.
The Internal Market Bill is aimed at ensuring Britain's four nations can trade freely with one another after leaving the European Union, but the government says that requires creating powers to override part of the withdrawal treaty it signed with Brussels.
WHY DOES BRITAIN WANT TREATY-BUSTING POWERS?
The government says the powers are a safety net to protect peace in Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on how to manage cross-border trade fail. 
The EU wants to make sure the open border with Ireland doesn't act as a back door into the bloc for goods. Britain wants to make sure goods flow freely between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
The bill must pass through both houses of the British parliament to become law -- first the House of Commons, where Johnson's Conservative Party has an 80-seat majority, and then the House of Lords, the upper chamber, where it does not have a majority.
The bill passed its first stage in the Commons by 340 votes to 263, and looks set to clear further stages next week after Johnson moved to avert a rebellion by offering concessions. 
The bill is scheduled to finish its journey through the lower house on Sept. 29. 
After this it will undergo scrutiny in the House of Lords. The bill is not being fast-tracked by Lords and will take most of October and November to consider. 
This means it will not be law either before the EU's end of September deadline to withdraw the bill, or Johnson's Oct. 15 deadline for a deal with the EU. The negotiations around either of these deadlines, if successful, could remove the need for the bill's most contentious parts.
CAN THE HOUSE OF LORDS BLOCK THE BILL?
Many members of the upper house have criticised the bill, including Conservatives, but their primary role is to amend and improve legislation, not to block it on principle. 
While there is precedent for the Lords blocking legislation, deciding to do so on this bill would provoke a constitutional row, and such a move is currently seen as unlikely.
The House of Lords is more likely to seek to amend the bill to remove or dilute certain parts, or insert additional checks and balances. The amendments would go back to the House of Commons for approval -- probably in early December.
If Johnson's lower-house majority holds firm, the bill could bounce back and forth between the two chambers until either a compromise is found or the government attempts to pass it without House of Lords approval.
WHAT CONCESSIONS HAS THE GOVERNMENT MADE?
Johnson has so far made two concessions.
Firstly he promised parliament a vote on any decision to use the treaty-breaking powers created by the bill -- a compromise that snuffed out a rebellion within his own party.

Secondly, he has also committed to referring any dispute with the EU to the resolution mechanism set out in the Withdrawal Agreement ""in parallel"" to using the treaty-busting powers unilaterally.

346,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>",Attacks surge in northwest Pakistan as Afghan peace effort brings shifting sands,"By Umar Farooq
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Militants have stepped up attacks on security forces in northwest Pakistan raising fears of a revival of their insurgency and a return of lawlessness as brighter prospects for peace in Afghanistan herald shifting Islamist alliances.
The ethnic Pashtun border region was for years a haven for militants who fled the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. But the Pakistani military cleared out the strongholds in a 2014 offensive, driving most of the fighters into Afghanistan.
But since March, al Qaeda-linked Pakistani Taliban, facing the risk of losing havens on the Afghan side of the border if their Afghan Taliban allies make peace there, have unleashed a wave of attacks on the Pakistani security forces.
Bolstering their bid to re-establish themselves in the border lands, the Pakistani Taliban, or Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), struck an alliance in July with half a dozen small militant factions.
""The group's capability and military strength has increased, as has their reach,"" said Mansur Khan Mahsud, executive director of the Islamabad-based FATA Research Centre.
September has seen near daily incidents, from roadside bombs to sniper attacks, to ambushes and the killing of residents accused of collaborating with government forces.
The militants have killed at least 40 soldiers since March, according to a Reuters tally of official figures.
At least 109 people were killed in 67 attacks between January and July - twice the number in 2019, according to the FATA Research Centre.
""TTP's regrouping is concerning both because of its own activities and its links to groups like al Qaeda,"" said Elizabeth Threlkeld, a former State Department official who served in Pakistan, now deputy-director for the South Asia program at the Washington-based Stimson Center. 
""It could again provide significant support to international terror groups if it continues to regain ground."" 
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE
Militant violence surged in Pakistan after it was pressed to sign on to the U.S.-led war on terror after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, even though it had for years supported the Afghan Taliban.
Soon the Pakistani government found itself under attack from home-grown Taliban but the military succeeded in pushing them out of the region, known as the tribal areas, in 2014, forcing the Pakistani Taliban into Afghanistan. 
Millions of residents were displaced by the fighting but since then, militant violence in Pakistan has largely ceased.
But now fears are growing that the surge of Pakistani Taliban violence is an unintended consequence of efforts to make peace in Afghanistan.
In February, the Afghan Taliban and the United States struck a deal allowing for the withdrawal of U.S. forces in exchange for Afghan Taliban guarantees they would not harbour other militants.
The United Nations said in a report in July there were more than 6,000 Pakistani fighters in Afghanistan, most affiliated with the TTP, who could be heading home if they lose their refuge.
""It's a concern for everyone,"" a Western security official based in Pakistan told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Pakistan's military did not respond to a request for comment on the violence but its spokesman said on Twitter recently that the attacks were ""meant to derail (the) Afghanistan Peace Process.""
For those living in the area, insecurity is again becoming a daily worry. 
The TTP issued a statement this week telling residents to leave ""until peace returns"".

""Our war against Pakistan is continuing and you will continue to see daily attacks,"" the militants said.

TIOMAN, Malaysia (Reuters) - Every weekend, a team of volunteers comb the coastline of the Malaysian resort of Tioman to collect plastic trash that washes up on the white-sand beaches of the island lapped by the South China Sea. 
But rather than burn or bury the trash, it is being recycled into plastic pellets so that it can be used to make a range of products from auto parts to home appliances and furniture. 
""Everything is wrapped in plastic these days so it's incredibly hard,"" said Sydney Steenland, the founder of the Sea Monkey Project, a non-governmental group involved in recycling ocean waste. 
While the initiative does help clean up the environment and recycle waste, Steenland admits ""it's never going to actually stop the situation if you don't tell people to stop using the plastic first."" 
Heng Hiap, based in the southern Malaysian state of Johor, is one of a growing number of companies working with environmentalists to collect and remove plastic waste in the country's waters.
""Marine pollution is becoming a problem and we decided to focus on ocean-bound plastic material,"" said the company's founder Seah Kian Hoe, noting the aim was to serve conscientious consumers.
Conservation group WWF released a report earlier this year saying that out of six Asian countries Malaysia was one of the leading consumers of plastic packaging, at around 16 kg (35 lb) per person each year. 
The report looked at China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, which are estimated to contribute 60% of the roughly 8 million tonnes of plastic that enters the world’s oceans each year.
The pellets made by Heng Hiap are sold to companies such as Kian, a furniture maker.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the cap on the number of people allowed into Australia each week would increase by 2,000 by mid October after a National Cabinet meeting where states agreed to boost quarantine capacity.
The country's weekly limit is currently set at 4,000 people.
Morrison said there were an estimated 24,000 stranded Australians wanting to return home which the government has pledged to facilitate before Christmas.
""With the success we have had as a country in recent months, we can start opening up again and we can start helping Australians getting home again,"" Morrison told a press briefing.
Australia is also looking to ease quarantine restrictions for returned travellers from New Zealand which has effectively stamped out the virus, and who account for 15% of returns, to free up hotels for other travellers, Morrison said.
Australia closed its international borders early in the pandemic, and imposed strict lockdowns and social distancing measures, dramatically reducing the spread of the virus. It currently has a mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine for all international arrivals.
Australia has reported more than 26,800 coronavirus cases and 829 deaths, well below the infection and death rates of other developed countries. 
The bulk of its infections have been in the hotspot state of Victoria, were new infections have been falling for weeks.
Victoria logged 45 fresh cases overnight and five deaths, the highest number of new cases in more than a week, following 28 new cases on Thursday which was the lowest in three months. 
Its rolling two-week average of new infections has been falling, raising hopes lockdown measures confining residents to their homes may be eased before the Oct. 26 deadline. 
Average cases over the last two weeks in Melbourne, the state's largest city, fell below 50 this week, the benchmark the state set to start easing curbs.
Australia's six states and two territories have either closed domestic borders or severely limited entry.
Queensland state said that it would open up its border to residents of the national capital Canberra, which has had no new infections in 10 weeks.

A bulk carrier owned by Japan's Nagashiki Shipping and chartered by Mitsui OSK ran aground on a reef off Mauritius on July 25 and later began leaking oil into the pristine waters around the Indian Ocean island. 
The Japanese government said in a statement that it would send a team of five people to Mauritius on Sept. 20.
Japan previously told Mauritius it would offer support on an ""unprecedented scale.""
The Panamanian-flagged MV Wakashio began spilling fuel oil on Aug. 6, prompting the Mauritian government to announce an environmental emergency. The captain and another member of the crew have been arrested by Mauritius police.
Scientists say the full impact of the spill is still unfolding but the damage could affect Mauritius and its tourism-dependent economy for decades.

Mitsui OSK last week said it would contribute about 1 billion yen ($9.4 million) to help Mauritius.

354,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 12:10AM ET</span>","In bumpy U.N. dealings, Trump found backing on North Korea, isolation on Iran","By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Though famously skeptical of the United Nations, U.S. President Donald Trump harnessed its collective power to impose crushing sanctions on North Korea in a bid to start talks with Pyongyang, but faces frustration over a similar push on Iran.
While the U.N. Security Council was unified on North Korea, there is almost total opposition to the Trump administration's assertion that it has triggered a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran, using a process agreed under a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran that Washington quit two years ago. 
Diplomats expect Iran to be a focus when Trump addresses the annual U.N. meeting of world leaders on Tuesday from the White House just days after a deadline passes that Washington says requires all countries to extend https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-arms-exclusive/exclusive-trump-plans-executive-order-to-punish-arms-trade-with-iran-sources-idUSKBN268308?il=0 an arms embargo and reimpose other sanctions on Tehran.
It will be the fourth U.N. speech by Trump, who is seeking re-election on Nov. 3 and espouses an ""America first"" approach often at odds with the multilateralism that governs the world body. Diplomats gasped during his debut when he threatened ""fire and fury"" on North Korea and laughed the second year when he boasted about his accomplishments. Last year he denounced Iran's ""bloodlust,"" but said there was a path to peace.
After years of U.S. rhetoric on Iran at the United Nations, Washington said it took action at the 15-member Security Council last month that it said would lead to a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran this weekend.
But 13 members, including America's long-time allies, said the U.S. move has no legal effect and diplomats say few countries are likely to implement the measures, which were lifted under the deal between world powers and Iran that aimed to stop Tehran developing nuclear weapons. 
""There should be joint leverage against Iran on the nuclear and other files,"" said a senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""Damage is done when that unity cracks and one country goes it alone and the leverage is reduced.""
Pompeo said on Wednesday that the United States would do ""all the things we need to do"" to enforce the U.N. sanctions. 
Trump called the Iran nuclear agreement the ""worst deal ever."" Since withdrawing, the Trump administration has imposed unilateral sanctions under what it says is a ""maximum pressure"" campaign to force Iran to negotiate a new deal. 
A senior Security Council diplomat, also speaking on condition of anonymity, argues the Iran nuclear deal had been working until Washington quit and ""Iran is closer to the bomb right now than it was two years ago,"" adding that the threat posed by North Korea ""now is bigger than three years ago.""
PRESSURE TO TALK
Despite his disregard for the U.N., Trump got off to a good start in his first year in office: the Security Council unanimously agreed to a U.S.-led push bolster sanctions on North Korea three times after Pyongyang tested long range ballistic missiles and carried out a nuclear test.
In 2018, then U.S. envoy to the U.N. Nikki Haley recalled that she told Trump: ""We would not be in the situation we are with North Korea without the U.N. because that was the only way to get the international community on the same page.""
The pressure allowed Trump to open a diplomatic door to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un aimed at Pyongyang's denuclearization. But despite three meetings, no progress has been made and Security Council unity appears shaky as China and Russia are suggesting it consider lifting some sanctions on Pyongyang to encourage further talks. 
Trump, however, says his diplomacy is working as Kim has not carried out any nuclear or long-range missile tests since 2017.
Trump has turned his back on decades of U.S. leadership at the U.N., by pulling out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, the World Health Organization, the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, a global accord to tackle climate change and opposed a U.N. migration pact. Washington has cut funding for the U.N. Population Fund and the U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees.
Nevertheless, Trump has admitted that he sees potential in the U.N. and has used the U.S. position at the organization's biggest funder to push Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to carry out reforms. 
Trump, it turns out, also pushed for U.N. involvement when his diplomats would not. 
When North Korea invited then U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman to visit Pyongyang in 2017 amid Trump's blunt rhetoric and sanctions campaign, Trump overruled opposition from his own officials to say Feltman should go, Feltman told Reuters last week. 
Six months later, Trump had his first meeting with Kim in Singapore.

""I wouldn't say it paved the way (for the Singapore summit), I think everything contributes,"" Guterres told Reuters on Monday of the visit by Feltman in 2017. ""But what matters here is that the key protagonists engage with each other.""

355,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 11:50PM ET</span>",Missile launch or storm repairs? Flurry of activity fuels speculation of North Korea test,"By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - Analysts and security officials say they are watching for signs that North Korea may use an upcoming holiday to unveil new weapons or test fire a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), after a flurry of activity was detected at a key base.
Formations of troops have been seen practicing for what is expected to be a major military parade on Oct. 10, the 75th anniversary of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea. Some observers say North Korea may showcase its largest missiles for the first time since 2018.
Imagery analysts and security officials caution that so far there is no conclusive evidence of an impending launch. But after several typhoons lashed North Korea in early September, satellite photos have shown a flurry of activity at the Sinpo South Shipyard, including in a secure basin where a barge used in previous underwater missile launches is docked.
""We're monitoring developments, as there is a possibility that a submarine-launched ballistic missile test will be conducted there using ejection equipment shortly after the repair is done,"" Won In-choul, the nominee for chairman of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, told lawmakers this week. 
Other South Korean officials have sounded more cautious notes, including incoming South Korean defence minister Gen. Suh Wook, who said on Monday that he considered an SLBM test unlikely because there is too little time to prepare ahead of the anniversary.
On Thursday, Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that reports on North Korea, cited a single unnamed source near the shipyard as saying the site ""is bustling with activity to prepare for the ballistic missile launch,"" with officials and researchers arriving since late August.
38 North, a U.S.-based think tank, said in a report on Wednesday that imagery showed ""heavy activity"" at the shipyard, but that ""no other indicators of launch preparations were observed.""
Although the activity does suggest some kind of work is being done on the missile barge, which has either been moved from the basin or repositioned under a protective awning, it would also be consistent with basic repair work after the storm, said Dave Schmerler, a senior researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. 
On Sept. 4, the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said satellite imagery showed activity at Sinpo that was ""suggestive, but not conclusive, of preparations for an upcoming test of a Pukguksong-3 submarine launched ballistic missile from the submersible test stand barge.""
Last October, North Korea said it had successfully test-fired a Pukguksong-3, which elicited no major reaction from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has held up the absence of intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear tests by that country since 2017 as a diplomatic success and played down shorter-range launches.

Although North Korea could roll out a new weapons system, there are no indications that the country is looking at ""lashing out"" ahead of the expected military parade, the commander of U.S. military forces in South Korea said last week.

Taiwan's Chinese Wild Bird Federation (CWBF), based in a small Taipei office, this week became the latest and unlikely front in the geopolitical battle between China and democratically-run Taiwan.
In a statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, CWBF said BirdLife International removed it as a partner after it refused to sign a document committing to not promote or advocate the legitimacy of the Republic of China or the independence of Taiwan from China. The Republic of China is Taiwan's formal name. 
China has ramped up pressure on international groups and companies to refer to Taiwan as being part of China, part of efforts to assert its sovereignty, to the anger of Taiwan's government and many of its people. 
While the Cambridge-based BirdLife International has not commented publicly on the issue, in an email to staff that was reviewed by Reuters, its CEO Patricia Zurita referred to the ""sadly public statement"" issued by CWBF on the issue. 
BirdLife as a matter of policy does not comment on internal and governing matters related to its partners, she wrote.
""If you receive any queries regarding this matter, please DO NOT offer comment and instead refer the matter to me directly,"" Zurita said. 
Zurita did not respond to an emailed request for comment, nor a message left on her mobile phone or message sent to it.
In a brief emailed comment to Reuters late on Thursday, BirdLife said they will try to respond more fully as soon as they can. 
Since the news broke, messages have been posted on BirdLife's social media pages denouncing their decision to remove CWBF as a partner, and saying BirdLife has kowtowed to China's Communist Party. 
The CWBF has been shocked by the decision, saying it was a non-political organisation and could not sign any political documents as they were conservationists not politicians. 
The CWBF declined to comment on the gag order, referring instead to its earlier statement.
However, a major partner of BirdLife, Britain's Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, told Reuters it was continuing its work with the CWBF.
""There are no political preconditions,"" it said in an emailed comment.

Anez said in a video message she sought to unify those opposing the candidate for the party of Morales, who resigned last year after an election sparked widespread protests. Anez, a former senator, took office in the power vacuum that followed Morales' departure.
The Oct. 18 vote is the delayed rerun of the 2019 ballot. Anez's candidacy had sparked controversy after she initially ruled herself out and pledged to guide the country to transparent new elections. Socialist candidate Luis Arce of the MAS party leads in opinion polls, followed by centrist former President Carlos Mesa. Anez had been in fourth place. 
""Today I put aside my candidacy for the presidency of Bolivia, for the sake of democracy,"" Anez said, citing ""the risk that the vote is divided among several candidates and that as a result of that division, the MAS would end up wining.""
""If we don't unite, Morales will return. If we don't unite, democracy loses,"" she said, calling for unity among voters opposed to MAS. She declined to say which candidate she planned to vote for.
By pulling out of the race, Anez could increase chances that the election will be pushed to a second round by consolidating the anti-Arce vote.
To avoid a second round, the election winner requires at least 40% of valid votes in the first round and a 10-point advantage over the closest competitor.

Arce has more than 40.3% support from likely voters, according to a recent poll, while Mesa was at 26.2%, conservative anti-Morales activist Luis Fernando Camacho at 14.4% and Anez at 10.6%.

360,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 09:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump plans executive order to punish arms trade with Iran - sources,"By Arshad Mohammed and Michelle Nichols
WASHINGTON/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump plans to issue an executive order allowing him to impose U.S. sanctions on anyone who violates a conventional arms embargo against Iran, four sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the executive order was expected to be issued in the coming days and would allow the president to punish violators with secondary sanctions, depriving them of access to the U.S. market.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The proximate cause for the U.S. action is the impending expiry of a U.N. arms embargo on Iran and to warn foreign actors - U.S. entities are already barred from such trade - that if they buy or sell arms to Iran they will face U.S. sanctions.
Under the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran struck with six major powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - the U.N. conventional arms embargo is to set to expire on Oct. 18, shortly before the Nov. 3 U.S. election. 
The United States, which abandoned the nuclear deal in May 2018, says it has triggered a ""snap back,"" or resumption, of all U.N. sanctions on Iran, including the arms embargo, which would take effect at 8 p.m. on Saturday night or 0000 GMT on Sunday.
Other parties to the nuclear deal and most of the U.N. Security Council have said they do not believe the United States has the right to reimpose the U.N. sanctions and that the U.S. move at the United Nations has no legal effect.
""It is obvious that none of the Security Council members have accepted the eligibility of U.S. claims,"" said Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations, adding that the nuclear deal remains in place and all sanctions on Iran will be lifted in under the time-lines agreed in 2015.
Trump's executive order is intended to show that the United States will not be deterred despite failing to win broader U.N. Security Council backing ""snap back,"" said one of the four sources.
Another of the sources, a European diplomat, said the new executive order would put teeth behind Washington's assertion that the U.N. arms embargo would remain in place beyond October by giving the president secondary sanctions authority to punish arms transfers to or from Iran with U.S. sanctions.
Secondary sanctions are those where one country seeks to punish a second country for trading with a third by barring access to its own market, a particularly powerful tool for the United States because of the size of its economy.
Most foreign companies do not wish to risk being excluded from the vast U.S. market in order to trade with smaller countries such as Iran.
The new executive order may be more symbolic than practical because so many Iranian entities and individuals are already subject to secondary sanctions, said one sanctions lawyer, Doug Jacobson.
""It's essentially piling on,"" Jacobson said. ""It’s designed to send a message on this particular issue ... that the U.S. is unhappy that the other parties (to the Iran nuclear deal) did not agree to a snap back of arms sanctions.""
Speaking on Wednesday, U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela and Iran, Elliott Abrams, said Washington planned to impose sanctions on those who violated the U.N. arms embargo, though he did not say it would do so with an executive order.
Also on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo obliquely hinted at the upcoming U.S. action by stressing the power of U.S. sanctions restored since it abandoned the Iran nuclear deal two years ago to deter foreign trade with Iran.
""We'll do all the things we need to do to ensure that those sanctions are enforced,"" Pompeo said of the U.N. arms embargo, recalling many experts argued U.S. unilateral sanctions imposed after it abandoned the nuclear deal would fail.

""We've been very successful in spite of what the world said would happen,"" he added, saying U.S. sanctions had drastically reduced Iran's financial resources.

361,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 09:11PM ET</span>",Firefighters start to gain upper hand against U.S. western wildfires,"By Brad Brooks
MOLALLA, Ore. (Reuters) - Crews who struggled just days ago against deadly wildfires raging unchecked across California, Oregon and Washington have now gone on the offensive, making substantial progress in subduing the blazes, officials in all three states said on Thursday.
More favorable weather in the region since last week has enabled ground teams with hand tools and bulldozers to regroup and consolidate their gains while also allowing greater use of water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers.
The region still faces a formidable recovery from the fires, which have burned some 3.2 million acres (1.3 million hectares) in California since mid-August and another 1.7 million acres (647,500 hectares) in Oregon and Washington state since Labor Day.
The fires, which scientists and officials describe as unprecedented in scope and ferocity, roared to life amid catastrophic lightning storms, a record-breaking heat wave and bouts of howling winds.
Several small towns were reduced to blackened rubble, with thousands of homes destroyed and at least 34 lives lost - 25 in California, eight in Oregon and one in Washington. Thousands of evacuees, especially in Oregon, remained huddled in emergency shelters, mobile trailers and hotel rooms.
The disaster even emerged at the forefront of the U.S. White House race, with Republican President Donald Trump downplaying climate change as a factor, while Democratic challenger Joe Biden branded Trump a ""climate arsonist"" for refusing to acknowledge the science of global warming. 
The situation was particularly dire in Oregon, a state unaccustomed to wildfires of such magnitude and lacking sufficient resources to deal with them. By Thursday, 11 days into the latest crisis, authorities in all three states were delivering a notably more optimistic assessment.
""My firefighting teams tell me we are making significant progress in fighting some of these fires,"" Governor Kate Brown told a news conference.
Thomas Kyle-Milward, a spokesman for Washington state's Department of Natural Resources, was likewise upbeat, telling Reuters separately, ""Despite thin resources, we're feeling like we're making good headway."" 
A key sign of success has been a steady rise in containment, a measure of the buffer lines that firefighters carve around the perimeter of each blaze by hacking away unburned vegetation to prevent its spread.
""We’re seeing containment numbers go up across a lot of the major fires that we’ve been working on,"" said Sean McFadden a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire).
While a handful of fires remain troublesome, the overall trend was positive he said, especially on the biggest lightning-sparked conflagrations that have been burning since mid-August.
""What we're seeing now is things are really starting to turn toward being completed,"" he added.
RAIN HEADED FOR OREGON
Thundershowers forecast for late on Thursday are expected to bring much-needed rain to parts of Oregon, especially the hard-hit western slopes of the Cascade Mountains, said Doug Grafe, fire protection chief for the state's Forestry Department.
He warned, however, that high winds and lightning from those storms could also complicate firefighting efforts, and heavy showers could lead to mudslides.
Still, Grafe said, several fires have been mostly suppressed, allowing the state to shift more resources to 10 major blazes that remain.
Oregon's firefighting force has more than doubled over the past week, with 6,500 personnel from within the state and elsewhere in the United States and Canada on the fire lines, along with other emergency responders. 
CalFire said more than 17,400 firefighters were deployed against 26 fires in the most populous U.S. state.
The West Coast wildfires have filled the region's skies with smoke and soot, but some areas on Thursday were the clearest they have been in days.
Kyle Sullivan, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in Medford, Oregon, said clearing smoke has allowed more firefighting to take place in the air with helicopters and planes dropping flame retardant. 
'DREAMING OF FIRE'
Drew Hansen, a 31-year-old logger raised on a tree farm near Molalla, Oregon, about 35 miles south of Portland, was part of a volunteer firefighting force battling the Riverside and Beachie Creek fires since Sept. 8.
""This is my backyard, we're fighting for our homes and families up here,"" Hansen said as he and a crew rested outside his parents' farmhouse outside of Molalla. ""It feels like we've not slept in a week. Even when I have slept, I'm dreaming of fire.""
All along the mountain roads in and around Molalla, farm families put out handmade signs, thanking those who risked their lives to battle the flames.

""This little town was surrounded by fire not long ago, and it was the civilians who stepped in when we needed help the most,"" said Ashley Bentley, owner of a local feed store whose husband was among those in the woods fighting fires. ""We had to act or the fire was going to take our town.""

The EU last week said there was not enough time left for it to send observers, at Venezuela's invitation. Maduro is eager to win international recognition for the poll, which the domestic opposition and the United States have said will likely be rigged in favor of the ruling socialist party.
""It is impossible because there is a very clear constitutional mandate,"" Maduro said in a state television address. ""We want to have a good relationship with the European Union, but Washington does not let them."" 
Relations between Caracas and Washington have deteriorated in recent years. The U.S. government has sanctioned Venezuela's state oil company to pressure Maduro - who it said is a dictator usurping power that rigged his 2018 re-election - to resign. 
Maduro has said the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to oust him in a coup to seize control of the OPEC member's large crude oil reserves. 
Maduro's government has systematically ignored the legislature's rulings since an opposition coalition won control of the body in late 2015.

Venezuela's constitution requires a new vote to be held every five years. Most mainstream opposition parties have vowed to boycott the election, arguing the Maduro-friendly Supreme Court has appointed loyalists to the electoral regulator and installed shadow allies to lead top opposition parties.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday he planned to establish a commission to promote ""patriotic education"" in the United States, taking issue with efforts to highlight the United States' history of slavery and racism.
In remarks delivered at the National Archives, which houses the U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Declaration of Independence, Trump railed against people who have taken to the streets around the country this year to protest racial injustice.
Republican Trump has sought to portray himself as a ""law and order"" candidate in the Nov. 3 election against Democratic rival Joe Biden and his announcement on Thursday to use an executive order to establish the commission could also be a move to appeal to his base.
Trump said ""left-wing mobs"" had torn down statues, desecrated memorials, and carried out a ""campaign of violence and anarchy.""
""Whether it is the mob on the street, or the cancel culture in the boardroom, the goal is the same: to silence dissent, to scare you out of speaking the truth, and to bully Americans into abandoning their values, their heritage, and their very way of life,"" Trump said.
""We are here today to declare that we will never submit to tyranny.  We will reclaim our history and our country for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed.""
Trump is trailing Biden in national opinion polls. Biden has also condemned looting and violence that have been part of some anti-racism protests.
Trump said the commission would ""encourage our educators to teach our children about the miracle of American history.""

""America’s founding set in motion the unstoppable chain of events that abolished slavery, secured civil rights, defeated communism and fascism, and built the most fair, equal, and prosperous nation in human history,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top officials in the U.S. Justice Department are encouraging prosecutors to consider sedition charges against protesters who have burned buildings and engaged in other violent activity, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Thursday.
Jeffrey Rosen, the department's No. 2 official, wrote that he and Attorney General William Barr have told prosecutors that they do not need to prove that defendants were plotting to overthrow the U.S. government in order to invoke the rarely used law.
""In appropriate cases - for instance, where a group has conspired to take a federal courthouse or other federal property by force - you should consider a charge,"" he wrote. 
Barr has mounted an aggressive response to racial-justice protests that have sometimes escalated into violence this summer after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd, a Black man. 
He has deployed federal agents to disperse protests in Washington and Portland, Oregon, over the protests of local leaders, and urged federal prosecutors to bring criminal charges whenever possible.
Barr has blamed the violence on left-wing ""antifa"" activists, although prosecutors have also brought charges against members of right-wing militia groups. He has said there is no ""systemic racism"" in law enforcement.
The ""seditious conspiracy"" statute makes it a crime to plot to overthrow the U.S. government or wage war against it, but it also outlaws attempts to stop authorities from enforcing the law. Those found guilty face up to 20 years in prison.
U.S. authorities used the law to successfully prosecute people who traveled overseas to fight U.S. forces after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. 
Prosecutors also brought sedition charges against nine members of an anti-government militia in 2010 who were charged with plotting a violent uprising. That case was dismissed.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra will face an impeachment hearing on Friday after the country's constitutional court on Thursday rejected his appeal to delay congressional efforts to remove him from his post.
The court´s president, Marianella Ledesma, told local radio RPP that judges had voted by five to two to reject an urgent petition by Vizcarra asking that Congress suspend a debate on whether to impeach him for ""moral incapacity.""
The court however admitted - by six to one votes - another lawsuit lodged by the president to determine whether Congress exceeded its powers by seeking to impeach him, starting a process that could take up to two months to reach a conclusion.
This means that on Friday, Vizcarra or his lawyer must face Congress, where he has no party representation, at a time when the copper-rich Andean nation is in the midst of an economic recession and one of the worst outbreaks of the coronavirus.
Lawmakers voted last week to impeach Vizcarra due to ""moral incapacity"" in a case involving the alleged irregular contracts worth $49,500 awarded to a little-known singer named Richard Cisneros. 
The scandal broke after leaked audio recordings were shared in Congress by opposition lawmakers of Vizcarra discussing meetings with the singer. Some lawmakers alleged the recordings showed him trying to downplay his ties to the performer. He has rejected the claims as ""without any foundation.""
Ledesma said the court had rejected Vizcarra´s argument for its urgent intervention in part because the likelihood of the impeachment motion´s success looked increasingly slim. [nL1N2GA076]
""In light of the statements made by the main leaders and congressional benches that they will not support the (motion) the risk of this happening has weakened,"" she said.
A total of 67 members of the 130-member Congress approved the start of impeachment proceedings, while impeachment itself needs 87 votes in order to remove Vizcarra from office. 
Carmen Omonte, a spokeswoman for the center-right party that has the second biggest group in Congress with 22 votes, Alliance for Progress, said on Thursday that they would not support the motion.
""The president should not be afraid and simply go to Congress with serenity,"" Omonte told reporters. 
A spokesman for the largest party, center-right Accion Popular, which has 25 votes, said it would wait for Vizcarra's defense before making a decision. 

An Ipsos poll released this week suggested 79% of Peruvians wanted Vizcarra to complete his term, which expires in July 2021.

(Reuters) - The number of same-sex married and unmarried couple households in the United States reached nearly 1 million in 2019, according to a U.S. Census Bureau survey that broke out the statistic for the first time. 
Married couples made up most (58%) of the 980,000 same-sex couple households, while 42% were identified as unmarried partner households, according to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, released on Thursday.
There were nearly 123 million households in the United States last year. 
The 2019 survey included revised questions designed to more accurately characterize and count same-sex couple households, the Census Bureau said, allowing it to break out same-sex household statistics for the first time. 
The survey found that female-couple households slightly outnumbered male-couple households among both married and unmarried people.
The number of same-sex couples nationwide is likely greater than the 980,000 tracked by the survey, which includes only those living in the same household.
The District of Columbia had the highest percentage of same-sex couple households at 2.4%, followed by Delaware (1.3%) and Oregon at Massachusetts (1.2%). 
The rate of labor participation for same-sex married people aged 16-64 was significantly higher (84.6%) than for opposite-sex married individuals (80.4%). 
Women married to a same-sex partner were much more likely to be employed than women married to a member of the opposite sex, while married men in same-sex household were less likely to be working than their peers in opposite-sex relationships. 

The number of married same-sex households in the United States has increased to 568,110 from 334,829 since 2014, the year before the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, according to Census Bureau data.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday announced charges against three Iranians over allegations they stole information from aerospace and satellite technology firms on behalf of the Islamic republic's Revolutionary Guards.
The indictments follow a flurry of recent actions against alleged Iranian cyber spies including the announcement, earlier on Thursday, that entities and individuals associated with an Iranian hacking group sometimes dubbed APT39 were being sanctioned by the Treasury Department. 
U.S. Assistant Attorney General John Demers said in a statement it was the third time in three days that alleged Iranian hackers had been indicted, calling out what he described as ""yet another effort by a rogue foreign nation to steal the fruits of this country's hard work and expertise."" 
The defendants, identified as Said Pourkarim Arabi, 34, Mohammad Reza Espargham, whose age is unknown, and Mohammad Bayati, 34, are alleged to have impersonated colleagues or academics to get their targets to download malicious software, prosecutors said. 
Attempts to locate contact information for the Iranian defendants were not immediately successful. Messages sent to email addresses allegedly used by the hackers either bounced back as undeliverable or were not immediately returned.
At one point, according to prosecutors, Arabi, Espargham, and Bayati had a hit list more than 1,800 accounts long, including targets in the aerospace and satellite technology fields as well as employees of international governmental organizations. The indictment did not identify the people or organizations targeted but said they hailed from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Israel, and Singapore. 
Prosecutors said the trio were working for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the United States considers a terrorist organization. Arabi, the indictment says, was an IRGC operations manager and lived in IRGC housing.

A message left with Iran's mission to the United Nations was not immediately returned. Tehran regularly denies involvement in hacking.

372,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 01:51PM ET</span>","In hard-hit Spain, the poor suffer even more from the pandemic","By Joan Faus
BARCELONA (Reuters) - Mohamed Chirif, a 45-year-old Algerian living in Barcelona, is afraid he might lose his job as a plumber if the coronavirus test he took this week turns out to be positive. 
""If I tell my boss that I have to stay home for 14 days, what do you think he will do? I am sure he would hire another person,"" he said, stressing that if he was infected, he would say so.
""And where would I self-isolate? In the bathroom?,"" he said during a voluntarily screening programme in his neighbourhood El Raval, one of Barcelona's most multicultural and poorest areas, whose infection rate is almost double the city's average. Chirif lives with his wife and two children in a one-bedroom apartment.
His words illustrate one of the challenges Spain faces trying to curb the spread of the virus. It has the highest number of cases in Western Europe, with more than 610,000, while more than 30,000 have died. 
Less well-off communities like El Raval are being hit harder, with the gap between poorer and richer areas at the heart of a tense debate in Spain over how to curb the increase in cases, as some cities envisage targeted lockdowns that would focus on the more affected - and therefore often poorer - areas.
At the peak of the pandemic, Barcelona's district with the lowest income had 2.5 times more cases than the richest while across the Catalonia region the mortality rate was five times higher among the poorest, two studies showed.
In Madrid, the infection rate in a northern district is almost six times lower than in a southern district with a lower average income and a higher migrant population. 
The risk of losing one's job was on the mind of many in the neighbourhood as tests were being carried out in El Raval.
Laia, a 23-year-old waiting in line to get tested, said some people may not come for fear of getting a positive test. ""You have your plans and if they tell you you're positive and have to stay home, some may not be willing to do it,"" she said. 
Pedro Gullon, a Spanish Epidemiology Society board member, said the inequality gap, fuelled by housing and labour factors, was not the only reason behind Spain's high infection rate, but the increase in cases had made those disparities more visible.

Seeking not to stigmatize El Raval and encourage residents to get tested, Barcelona's mayor Ada Colau said this week people who could not self-isolate at home could stay at hotels and those at home could receive food and medical visits.

""No Chinese soldiers was captured by Indian troops, but PLA captured many Indian soldiers that day,"" Hu Xijin said in the tweet https://twitter.com/HuXijin_GT/status/1306622885050478592, referring to China's People's Liberation Army (PLA).

Rowling said one of the characters in her new crime novel, a male killer who on one occasion disguises himself as a woman to abduct a victim, was loosely based on two real life murderers.
In a vitriolic online debate, pro- and anti-Rowling hashtags trended on Twitter after the novel's publication on Tuesday, because an early review in the Telegraph newspaper said the book's moral seemed to be ""never trust a man in a dress"".
Critics of the ""Harry Potter"" author accused her of revealing prejudice through a transphobic trope, while supporters defended her right to write fiction without people jumping to conclusions about her beliefs or abusing her.
Rowling has long faced accusations of transphobia, which she rejects, because of some of her tweets. In an essay in June, she defended her right to speak about trans and gender issues without fear of abuse and detailed her concerns about the impact of some trans activism on women's rights.
The 900-page book ""Troubled Blood"" is the fifth in the Cormoran Strike series Rowling has published under the name Robert Galbraith.
Writing on her Galbraith website, Rowling described the character as ""a sadistic serial killer active in the 60s and 70s, who was loosely based on real life killers Jerry Brudos and Russell Williams (NYSE:WMB) - both master manipulators who took trophies from their victims"".
Brudos and Williams both fetishised and stole items of women's clothing before they were jailed, in the United States and Canada respectively, for multiple murders.

The publishers said 100,000 copies of ""Troubled Blood"" were sold in the UK market on the first day, including hardback copies, e-books and audio books.

375,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>","Fundraising record, knighthood, now a book: UK veteran Moore ponders what's next","By Jonathan Shenfield
MARSTON MORETAINE, England (Reuters) - He turned 100, raised nearly 40 million pounds ($51.5 million) for Britain's health service and was knighted by the queen. But for Captain Tom Moore, the achievements of 2020 aren't over: he has written an autobiography and plans more charity work.
The World War Two veteran became a national hero for a fundraising campaign that involved him walking the length of his garden 100 times, turning him into a symbol of hope as the country struggled to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
""I hope I can go on for a long time, because I've got to hang on a bit until this book gets published probably,"" Moore, who now has the title ""Sir"", told Reuters.
""The family at different times say: 'You can't die yet, you've got to get all these different things done,' so I can't die yet. When this book is finally gone out into the world may be I can then, but that's not my intention.""
Moore, who turned 100 in April, was referring to his autobiography, ""Tomorrow Will Be A Good Day"", which describes his upbringing in northern England, passion for motorbikes, relationships, service in the war and late brush with celebrity.
Its title sums up Moore's optimism, which struck a chord at a time when deaths from COVID-19 were mounting and Britain, like most other countries, went into strict lockdown to contain the disease.
""There's no doubt the country is going through a little bad patch,"" he said, speaking in the garden of his home in Marston Moretaine near Milton Keynes, north of London.
""We shall get through it. It will get better ... So when I'm gone, I hope all you people look on the bright side and think that something will get better, as it will.""
CHAIR AND A HANDBAG
Moore, wearing a dark blue blazer and his campaign medals, said he was enjoying his fame, and one of the highlights was meeting Queen Elizabeth when she bestowed on him his knighthood.
""That was number one, because she is a charming person. I loved being with the queen,"" he said.
He recalled how he was momentarily confused by the curious case of a chair and a handbag. 
""Before the queen came, someone brought an armchair ... and I thought: 'That's for the queen to sit on'. But it's not true. That was for her handbag ... The chair was purely for the handbag.""
His daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, is helping him launch the Captain Tom Foundation, which aims to raise money to give to charities tackling issues including loneliness, bereavement, education and equality.
In his wife's final weeks, he would visit her in a home every day and was struck by how lonely some people there were.
""He saw and we witnessed this loneliness in its truly tragic form, so ... we are representing her and all those lonely people,"" Ingram-Moore said.
She described how Moore's global fame impacted the family; he has received 150,000 letters from well-wishers and 7,500 presents, and they continue to arrive.

Asked about what the future held for her father, she replied: ""Well, the world's his oyster isn't it? Anything could happen. There's talk of a film, of course he's written a children's book ... keep watching, it could be anything.""

While virtual lessons via the internet are already underway, the start of in-person learning had previously been delayed from Sept. 10 to Monday, Sept. 21, for those students who opted in. 
Now, only pre-kindergarten children and students with special learning needs will head into school buildings on Monday, the mayor said at a news conference. Elementary school students will begin Tuesday, Sept. 29. Middle school and high school students will start Oct. 1.
The delay came after leaders of the teachers' unions contacted de Blasio on Wednesday with ""real concerns,"" according to the mayor, who oversees a school system that serves more than 1.1 million children.
""Although they acknowledge that some real progress had been made, not enough had been made, and more had to be done to make sure that things would be as strong as they needed to be,"" de Blasio told reporters.
He said students and staff had continued to change their minds about their comfort with learning in person, making it difficult to plan to have enough teachers to staff every classroom. A total of 4,500 additional educators have been hired, de Blasio said, adding that he expects to announce the hiring of more in coming weeks.
Most other major school districts in the United States have scrapped plans to resume in-person learning for now. In Los Angeles, the second largest school district in the nation, and Chicago, students are staying home and using laptops to sign into classes. 
Efforts in New York City, which in the spring was the U.S. epicenter of the global pandemic, are being closely watched. Its plans call for students to spend some of the week in schools and the remainder learning at home online.
The mayor was joined by leaders of teachers' unions, who had expressed concerns about efforts to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. De Blasio has sought to reassure school staff that ventilation systems are being upgraded, nurses are being hired, protective equipment is being stockpiled and access to testing is being improved.
""If we're going to do this, we must make sure that we get this right,"" Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said at the news conference. 

The city had previously agreed with the unions that there would be monthly coronavirus testing of students and staff, with systems in place to send home classrooms or shut down entire schools if new COVID-19 cases are found.

377,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 12:31PM ET</span>",How a 'Hillbilly Brigade' saved an Oregon town from raging wildfires,"By Brad Brooks
MOLALLA, Ore. (Reuters) - Nicole West steered her bulldozer through the smoldering forest, pushing logs into the underbrush and away from the wildfires ripping through Oregon's Cascade Mountains. Her border collie, Oink, rode shotgun as West and a volunteer crew raced to clear a fireline.
Behind West, on the front lines of the 136,000-acre Riverside fire, two young men pulled a water tank behind their pickup truck, struggling to douse the flames.
These are the men and women of the ""Hillbilly Brigade"" - about 1,200 in all who came together this past week to fight the state’s biggest fire in a century. They are credited with saving the mountain hamlet of Molalla, an hour’s drive south of Portland, after its 9,000 residents were forced to evacuate.
In a year when ferocious wildfires have killed at least 21 people and burned millions of acres in Oregon, Washington and California, the brigade has pulled off a miracle in the thick forests around Molalla in recent days, residents and fire officials say. They organized and deployed themselves with little or no help from a small and overwhelmed local fire department - which focused on protecting the town center - or from state and federal agencies who were deployed elsewhere.
""We were left on our own to stop this,"" said West, a 36-year-old ranch hand, as she briefly paused her dozer late Wednesday afternoon. ""There wasn't anybody coming from the state to save us. So we had to save ourselves.""
Mike Penunuri, fire marshal for the Molalla fire district, which has just 13 firefighters and 33 volunteers, called the massive ad-hoc effort “amazing.” Penunuri's crews spent the past week hosing down flames that lapped at the town’s edge and battling back fires around farm houses. 
The Hillbilly Brigade ""improvised and turned their pick-ups into fire engines on the fly,"" he said. ""They put stock tanks in the beds and used pumps to put out hot spots. These are just regular guys from the area. They are not trained.""
'I’M JUST THAT GUY'
Residents of Molalla went to sleep on Labor Day thinking it was safe from the wildfires, but unusual wind gusts stunned forecasters and officials and pushed the fire north at a rapid clip. In the early morning hours on Sept. 8, it looked like Molalla would be engulfed in flames, just as towns in southern Oregon had been.
The brigade formed quickly, amassing people who knew one another well and knew the difficult terrain all around them better than any outsider. They were lumberjacks and dairy farmers, friends and neighbors, cobbling together rudimentary equipment.
On September 8, Terry Price heard a neighbor banging at his door at 1 a.m., warning of fast-approaching fires about four miles south of Molalla on the Missouri Ridge. The Riverside fire was barreling down a valley toward his place as the Beachie Creek fire approached from the southwest.
In that moment, the 59-year-old Price, a salty and assertive man, became the de facto Hillbilly Brigade leader in this section of the county, neighbors said.
""I dole things out for the boys to do,"" Price said. ""I'm just that guy. It's what I've always done.""
The brigade filled a vacuum left by the absence of any government help, he said. The fires raging across Oregon have depleted the state's resources to battle the unprecedented blazes.
""I was in horrible disbelief that nobody showed up,"" he said.
The Oregon Department of Forestry and the office of Oregon Governor Kate Brown did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday morning on whether the state responded to fires near Molalla or what might have prevented a response.
'THEM AND A SHOVEL'
Price and other landowners quickly realized they needed to save themselves and started calling one another. Within a couple of hours, Price's driveway became the headquarters for his area.
“It seemed like about everybody dropped everything and showed up by dawn,"" Price said. ""Even if it was just them and a shovel. They came to help."" 
Dairy farmers brought water trucks that they normally use for their cattle. Loggers had smaller water tankers. 
Price said the crew on Missouri Ridge had no access to water. So he set about ripping 20-foot-wide fire lines in the forest with a bulldozer, which itself caught on fire at times as the trees blazed around him. Price's 30-year-old son, Breck, guided him around massive tree trunks as he pushed forward. For two straight days he cut through the earth - and kept the fire at bay about 100 yards from his house.
The sky was black and purple. The wind drove the firestorm directly toward his house. Price had never seen anything like it. “It’s beyond scary,” he said.
EASY COMMUNICATION
On Wednesday, Matt Meyers, a 41-year-old power company employee, emerged from the fire’s haze on a mountainous patch called Elk Prairie. He had a chainsaw on his shoulder and a week’s worth of grime caked to his face. 
Meyers and his crew were on their ninth straight day of battling blazes for more than 20 hours a day. He explained that he was acting as a type of scout, pushing ahead into the forest ahead of the dozers. He cut down ""snags"" - dead trees that could quickly fall onto the machinery and drivers - and blazed the initial trails into the forest.
The operation thrived on close and long-standing relationships, he said.
""I'm up here fighting these fires with people I've known my whole life,"" Meyers said. ""Communication was easy: We could just stand at the tailgate of a truck and say, 'Steve, do you remember where Brian killed his first buck? You take your crew there.'""
The result was a victory - for now - over what had seemed like an overwhelming threat. The Beachie Creek and Riverside fires are not yet contained, leaving residents here on edge. But many are optimistic that the miles of firelines the brigade cut through the forest will provide a buffer if the winds blow the flames back their way.
""I think we saved the damn town, to put it bluntly,"" Meyers said. ""I'm a humble man, but I feel comfortable saying that.""

Asked what it meant to him to see his community come together to save itself, Meyers said: ""If I had not sweated out all my water, I think I would cry just thinking about that.""

Turkey and Greece have been locked in a bitter dispute over conflicting claims on the extent of their continental shelves and exploration for potential energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean. Tensions flared last month when Turkey sent the Oruc Reis to contested waters also claimed by Greece and Cyprus.
On Sunday, Oruc Reis returned to Turkey's southern province of Antalya for what Ankara called ""routine maintenance"", a move Greece called a positive first step in easing tensions. The two countries began talks at NATO to avoid military accidents in the region, after a small naval collision last month.
Speaking at an online panel, Kalin said Oruc Reis' return to Antalya was an opportunity to advance talks and this ""should not be squandered"", adding that Ankara hopes this will be ""reflected positively"" at a European Union summit on Sept. 24-25.
""We want to see a new page turned in the relations between Turkey and Greece, but also in relations between Turkey and the EU,"" Kalin said. 
""We are hopeful, we believe the climate is conducive to that at the moment and we have, I think, reached an understanding with regards to which steps we need to be taking over the next few weeks to resume these talks,"" he said.
On Wednesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Oruc Reis' maintenance may take ""a few weeks"" according to the energy ministry, but added the vessel will resume its operations afterwards.
EU leaders will address the issue at the summit later this month and evaluate potential sanctions. Germany wants more time for talks with Turkey while France, Cyprus and Greece demand a punitive response to Turkey.

Turkey has two exploration vessels off the divided island of Cyprus, which has long been at odds with Ankara over oil and gas drilling. Turkey recognised a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north of the island, but not the internationally-recognised Greek Cypriot government.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia said on Thursday China's recent actions around the world were not those of a responsible global actor, but of a ""lawless bully,"" a further ratcheting up of rhetoric against Beijing as the U.S. election approaches.
In prepared testimony for a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, David Stilwell said the United States was not asking other countries to choose sides, but to stand up against China's ""malign"" behavior and to protect their own sovereignty and economic interests.
At the same time, Stilwell said U.S. competition with China need not lead to conflict, and that the United States sought to cooperate with Beijing where interests aligned, for instance on North Korea.
Stilwell said in the past several months there had been ""particularly egregious examples of Beijing's conduct.""
These included violence on its border with India and ""aggressive"" moves in the South China Sea, around Taiwan, and in waters China disputes with Japan.
He also referred to alleged Chinese attempts to ""wipe out"" Mongolian and Tibetan culture, ""a continued campaign of repression and forced labor"" in Xinjiang and Beijing's imposition of a ""draconian"" National Security Law in Hong Kong.
""These are not the actions of a responsible global actor, but a lawless bully,"" he said.
China's embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Stilwell's remarks, but Beijing routinely rejects such criticisms as inaccurate and ill-intentioned. 
Stilwell's comments came as the U.S. administration has stepped up criticism, sanctions and other actions against China as Republican President Donald Trump campaigns for reelection in November.
China has become the main foreign policy issue in the campaign. On Thursday, Senate Democrats announced their own program to counter China's global influence, unveiling sweeping legislation seeking to boost U.S. competitiveness and recast diplomacy with Beijing.
The top U.S. diplomat for European affairs, Philip Reeker, told the same Senate hearing Europe was ""arguably"" the central front in China's effort to supplant U.S. global leadership, but Russia remained the primary military threat there.
Reeker said the United States was working to set up a senior level meeting with the European Union late this month or early next to launch a dialogue on China.
Stilwell said Washington would continue to advance engagement with Taiwan, which China views as a lawless province, and provide it with arms to ensure it could defend itself, but stressed that Washington remained committed to a 'one-China' policy, which officially recognizes Beijing, not Taipei.

Earlier, China said it would make a ""necessary response"" to a visit to Taiwan by U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach that began on Thursday, and had lodged a complaint with Washington.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain may have won international praise for following in the United Arab Emirates' footsteps and establishing ties with Israel, but the dramatic move by the close U.S. ally could stir a new wave of opposition at home.
While the deal will enable Bahrain's Sunni Muslim monarchy to win more support from Western and regional partners, it risks deepening political tensions and may energise a long demoralised opposition led by the Shi'ite majority.
Bahrain, host to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet and other international naval operations, was the only Gulf Arab state to witness a sizeable pro-democracy uprising in the 2011 ""Arab Spring"", which it quashed with Saudi and Emirati help.
Low-level dissent has continued, periodically flaring into rock-throwing skirmishes and crude bomb and shooting attacks, putting the kingdom on the frontline of a region-wide tussle for influence between Iran and its Sunni rival Saudi Arabia.
The government has used an array of powers to quell the unrest: Arrests, security raids, revoking of citizenship and bans on opposition parties and newspapers have helped reduce the risk of big popular protests. 
But anger has boiled anew since the deal was announced on Friday. 
Sporadic street protests have taken place each night since the accord, which the government says supports ""peace between Bahrain and Israel"". The authorities avoid the contested term ""normalisation"", which to some suggests entrenching Israel's diplomatic and military superiority over Palestinians. 
""I am Bahraini and the Bahraini regime does not represent me,"" read one protest banner, shared on social media.
""Normalisation is treason,"" read others.
Asked to comment on opposition to the deal, including opposition allegations that the government has limited the scope of parliamentary debate, a government spokesperson said freedom of opinion and expression are protected by the constitution and the government continued to uphold them robustly.
""The historic diversity of Bahrain has shaped a society that embraces coexistence and tolerance. These principles are vital to securing lasting regional stability and peace, and underpin the declaration of peace signed by the Kingdom of Bahrain and the State of Israel,"" the spokesman said in a statement to Reuters.
SHI'ITE CLERIC
Speaking largely from abroad, opposition figures rejected the deal. Bahrain's top Shi'ite cleric Ayatollah Sheikh Isa Qassim called, from exile in Iran, for the region's people to resist. 
Manama accuses Shi'ite Muslim Iran of seeking to subvert Bahrain. The government denies repressing the opposition and says it is protecting national security from groups it calls terrorists backed by Iran. Tehran denies it backs subversion.
Analysts say despite the surge in popular anger, the deal may have strengthened the government, since traditional allies are more likely to turn a blind eye to any further crackdown. 
""The move will garner Bahrain some credit in Washington, which could reduce the already limited pressure Manama faces on its domestic policies from the U.S.,"" said Graham (NYSE:GHM) Griffiths, associate direct at Control Risks.
Bahrain's interior minister said shortly after the announcement that the deal with Israel protects Bahrain's interests amid what he called the danger from Iran. 
The island nation has long been heavily dependent on close ally Saudi Arabia, and was bailed out financially in 2018 with a $10 billion aid package from Saudi, the UAE and Kuwait. 
""Bahrain is squarely focused on its critical ties with the United States and with its Gulf allies in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. These political dependencies condition immediate Bahraini alignment with the leadership in Abu Dhabi and Washington on this critical issue,"" said Kristin Smith Diwan of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. 
STATE-SANCTIONED CAUSE
Opposition figures say that a week before the agreement was announced, the government prepared for opposition to it by amending a law to further control parliament. A royal decree, announced on Sept. 3, ordered both houses of parliament to limit daily speaker numbers and banned criticism, blame or ""accusations that harm the country's interests"". 
""Eroding parliament's power has been ongoing since 2011 and the last royal decree has actually signed its death certificate,"" said Ali Alaswad, a former lawmaker of the main Shi'ite opposition group al-Wefaq, now in exile.
Defending Palestinian rights has been a state-sanctioned cause uniting Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims in Bahrain for decades, and its accord with Israel has left some in a tricky position. 
Founded in 2002 and with an office in the capital Manama, the Bahraini Society Against Normalisation with the Zionist Enemy said it was taken unawares.
""Some social media influencers started to accuse us of intolerance and called on the government to dissolve our organisation,"" said a founding member, declining to be named.
""The accord with Israel was a complete surprise for us,"" he said.
Both UAE and Bahraini officials have sought to reassure the Palestinians their countries are not abandoning their quest for statehood in the West Bank and Gaza, despite Palestinian leaders having decried the deals as a betrayal of their cause.

Foreign Minister Abdullatif al-Zayani told state media on Sept. 11 that Bahrain supported the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, a proposal under which normalisation with Israel would entail full Israeli withdrawal from territory captured in 1967.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Armed militia men killed more than 30 people in the Metakal zone of Ethiopia's Benishangul-Gumuz region, a senior opposition leader told Reuters on Thursday, the latest security headache for reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government.
The attacks, whose victims included women and children, happened on Sept. 6-13, said Desalegn Chane, a senior member of new political party the National Movement of Amhara (NAMA).
""Farmers and members of their families were kidnapped (and) brought to an elementary school in the area where they were handcuffed and shot one by one,"" Desalegn said. 
Abiy said a meeting on Thursday of the federal and regional authorities had ""evaluated the sporadic security incidents that have been occurring, particularly in the border areas"". 
""The 29 hostages taken in Benishangul-Gumuz region have been released,"" Abiy wrote on Twitter, adding the attackers are ""groups aimed at overturning the reforms journey"". 
Benishangul-Gumuz is a region bordering Sudan. 
The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said hundreds of civilians were displaced as a result of the violence and asked regional authorities to launch an investigation.
""There have been at least two rounds of killings of civilians, and hundreds of civilians have also been displaced,"" the commission said in a statement. 
Sitotaw Aweke, a farmer and businessman, said he was told by survivors that his whole family had been killed in an attack while he was at the market buying clothes for his three children for Ethiopia's new year, which is celebrated on Sept. 11. 
""I couldn't even bury them ... every time I look at the clothes I bought for them, I cry,"" he told Reuters by telephone. 
In June last year, men in camouflage uniforms killed more than 50 people and injured 23 in the same area. [USKCN1TR2FI]

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is increasing its military presence in the Far East in response to rising tensions in the wider region, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Thursday.
In remarks cited on the defence ministry website, Shoigu said reinforcements were being sent because of tensions in the ""eastern strategic direction"", referring to an area encompassing Russia's eastern border with China and the wider Asia-Pacific. 
Shoigu did not specify what the new threats were, or where the additional troops would go. He promised 500 units of new and modernised equipment for the region, as well as some improvements to the navy's Northern Fleet. 
Alexander Gabuev, an analyst at Moscow's Carnegie Centre, said Russia was ensuring it has sufficient military capabilities in an area where conflicts could spill over, noting a rising risk of a naval clash between the United States and China.
""Russia cannot be left defenceless and it also needs to operate its capabilites there, in terms of air force, defence and personnel,"" he said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia's concerns in the Far East centred around the actions of powers from outside the region, without specifying any countries or conflicts.
""All of these, of course, do not contribute to stability in this region,"" said Peskov.

Russia's Far East has also lately seen one of the longest sustained anti-government protest movements of President Vladimir Putin's two decades in power. The city of Khabarovsk, near the Chinese border, has seen weeks of demonstrations against the arrest of a local political leader.

Quim Torra was speaking at the Catalan government's delegation in Madrid after a Supreme Court hearing of his appeal against a sentence handed down by a lower court last December on charges of disobedience.
He had been banned from public office for 18 months and fined 30,000 euros but this did not come into effect pending his appeal.
The case stems from his refusal to follow the orders of Spain's electoral committee to remove symbols supporting jailed and self-exiled independence leaders from his government palace during a national election campaign in 2019.
If upheld, the ruling would bar him from public office and very likely prompt a snap regional election.
""If the Spanish state reaches a point of such absolute irresponsibility as to disqualify me, only one party is to blame: the state itself,"" he said. 
His responsibility as regional head of government ""means fighting the pandemic 24 hours a day,"" he said. His removal would mean ""punishment to a whole country in the middle of a pandemic"". 
""I'm not the one who will bring this country, at such a critical time, through an irresponsible electoral period that will paralyse Catalan administration,"" he said, reading a statement.
Catalonia has been a virus hotspot in Spain, which has Western Europe's highest number of cases. As of Wednesday, 30,243 deaths had been recorded nationwide. 
The separatist drive has dominated Spanish politics for the past several years. In 2017, the Catalan assembly made a unilateral declaration of independence after holding a referendum ruled illegal by Spanish judges, prompting the national government to take direct control of the region for over seven months. 
Nine separatist leaders are serving prison sentences for sedition and other charges, and others are in self-exile.
The court showdown comes at a time of increasing tensions within the pro-independence movement, part of which supports talks with Madrid. Opinion polls show Catalans are mostly split on independence.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union diplomacy to resolve a dispute with Turkey in the Mediterranean has become bogged down in competing initiatives a week before a summit meant to show Ankara a united front, according to EU member state envoys.
The impasse, which EU envoys were unable to break at a meeting on Wednesday, is holding up unrelated sanctions against Belarus and underscores the paralysis in foreign policy that the EU's chief executive berated publicly in a speech on Wednesday.
""It's an extremely difficult issue,"" one senior member state diplomat said. ""It is probably the single most worrying issue for the EU in the coming days.""
Turkey, an EU candidate country and NATO member, has alarmed the bloc by stepping up its gas exploration off Cyprus and claiming rights to waters also claimed by Greece and Cyprus.
The dispute has brought to a head a host of other tensions, from Turkey's involvement in Syria and Libya to what the EU says is growing authoritarianism under President Tayyip Erdogan. 
Gestures by Ankara this week to return an exploration ship to port have only served to complicate a unified EU response from all 27 governments.
""Turkey is trying to divide the member states,"" a second EU diplomat said, noting that Turkey had extended the operations of an energy drilling ship off Cyprus until mid-October.
Turkey does not recognise Cyprus, an EU and euro zone member, which was split after a Turkish invasion in 1974 spurred by a coup engineered by the generals then ruling Greece. A Turkish Cypriot state in north Cyprus is recognised only by Ankara. 
BELARUS DELAY
The issue, fast becoming the bloc's most intractable conflict, also highlights what European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen complained of on Wednesday, namely that all foreign policy decisions must be agreed by all governments. Von der Leyen called for majority voting. 
For the moment, Germany wants more time for talks with Turkey while France, Cyprus and Greece are demanding a punitive response to Turkish gas exploration in what the EU says are its territorial waters.
Hungary worries about antagonising Turkey and jeopardising a 2016 migration agreement in which Ankara gives shelter to Syrian refugees in return for EU funds.
Others favour using ""carrots"" as well as ""sticks"", by offering Turkey deeper trade and visa links with the world's largest trading bloc to calm the situation.
Meanwhile, Cyprus has asked for more time to consider separate sanctions on Belarus in support of a mass pro-democracy movement there, which other EU governments interpret as a way of pressing for similar punitive measures against Turkey. 
""It's fundamentally wrong to be linking Turkey and Belarus sanctions,"" said a third EU diplomat. ""Cyprus seems to be saying it will only approve Belarus the moment Turkey is done simultaneously. But that kills the idea of a swift EU reaction to the Belarus repressions.""
Cyprus denies linking the two issues.

EU foreign ministers will try to find a way through at their regular meeting on Monday. But diplomats say a solution will need the summit, looking to the bloc's most powerful leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, to find a way forward next Thursday or Friday.

The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said the U.S. Army-led Rapid Trident exercises, taking place near Yavoriv in western Ukraine, would involve about 4,000 servicemen from 10 countries.
It said the exercises show the strength of the U.S.-Ukraine strategic partnership and ""commitment to enhance readiness in a challenging operational environment, which increases the strong relationships that are necessary for peace and stability.""
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a speech at the opening of the exercises that a modern, equipped and capable Ukrainian army was his priority, and this army must be the guarantor of the free development of Ukraine.
Russian and Belarusian forces began drills in the Brest region near Belarus's border with Poland on Tuesday. Interfax news agency quoted Russia's defense ministry as saying the drills, due to run until Sept. 25, were for counter-terrorism purposes and were not directed against other countries.
Kyiv's relations with Moscow deteriorated in 2014 after Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine and backed pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's Donbass region. 
Ukraine's relations with Belarus soured when Kyiv last month condemned the Aug. 9 presidential election in Belarus as neither free nor fair after the election commission declared Lukashenko the winner.
Facing mass demonstrations by protesters who say the vote was rigged, Lukashenko, who denies electoral fraud, has been pushed back closer to traditional ally Moscow. 

Belarusian state news agency Belta quoted him on Wednesday as naming Ukraine and the United States among countries be accused of organizing the protests.

KIGALI (Reuters) - Paul Rusesabagina, depicted as a hero in a Hollywood movie about Rwanda's 1994 genocide and now on trial for terrorism, was denied bail on Thursday though he had promised not to escape.
Rusesabagina, who once called for armed resistance to the government in a YouTube video, was charged in a Kigali court on Monday with 13 counts including terrorism, complicity in murder and involvement with an irregular armed group.
The 66-year-old former hotel manager was portrayed in the Oscar-nominated film ""Hotel Rwanda"" using his connections with the Hutu elite to protect Tutsis fleeing the slaughter.
Rejecting Rusesabagina's bail application, Judge Dorothee Yankurije said he faced grave charges and must spend 30 days in jail while authorities complete investigations. 
""Being in jail will not stop Rusesabagina from having medical care,"" she said.
Rusesabagina, a Belgian citizen who had been residing in the United States, cited ill health in his application, vowing not to try to escape from Rwanda during the trial where he may face up to life imprisonment if convicted.
His lawyers said they were dissatisfied by the ruling and that they would launch an appeal.
""His illness is a key concern,"" David Rugaza, one of his lawyers, told reporters after the ruling.
His trial and the mysterious circumstances surrounding his appearance in Rwanda after years in exile are shining a spotlight on political opposition to President Paul Kagame.
Rusesabagina's family in the United States accuse Kagame's government of kidnapping him from Dubai, where he was on a trip, a claim that officials in Kigali reject. 
Kagame has ruled Rwanda since the end of the genocide and won the last elections - in 2017 - with nearly 99% of the vote. 

Though credited with bringing stability and economic growth, Kagame's foes say he has become increasingly autocratic.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden warned the United Kingdom that it must honour Northern Ireland's 1998 peace agreement as it withdraws from the European Union or there would be no separate U.S. trade deal.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is proposing new legislation that would break the Northern Ireland protocol of the Brexit divorce treaty that seeks to avoid a physical customs border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.
""We can't allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit,"" Biden said in a tweet on Wednesday.
""Any trade deal between the U.S. and U.K. must be contingent upon respect for the Agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period.""
Johnson insists he is defending not threatening the Good Friday pact, which ended three decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland between pro-British Protestant unionists and Irish Catholic nationalists.
He accuses the EU of trying to divide the United Kingdom and of putting a revolver on the table in talks to set rules for an estimated $1 trillion in annual trade after Britain's post-Brexit transition period expires at year-end. 
""The PM has been clear throughout that we are taking these steps precisely to make sure that the Belfast Agreement is upheld in all circumstances and any harmful defaults do not inadvertently come into play,"" Johnson's spokesman said.
The prime minister says the United Kingdom must have the ability to break parts of its Withdrawal Agreement with the EU if London is to uphold commitments under the 1998 peace deal.
The EU says any breach of the Brexit treaty could sink trade talks, propel the United Kingdom towards a messy exit when it fully departs on Dec. 31, and thus complicate the Northern Irish border, the country's only land frontier with the EU.
The EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told the bloc's 27 national envoys on Wednesday that he was still optimistic, three diplomatic sources told Reuters.
""Barnier still believes a deal is possible though the next days are key,"" said one of the EU sources.
'ABUSIVE' EU?
Johnson told The Sun newspaper that the EU must not be allowed to abuse Britain and risk four decades of partnership. 
He said the United Kingdom must ""ring-fence"" the Brexit deal ""to put in watertight bulkheads that will stop friends and partners making abusive or extreme interpretations of the provisions"". He used the example of a potential EU demand for tariffs on food going to Northern Ireland from Britain.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) analysts said on Thursday they now see an 80% chance that Britain and the EU will fail to strike a trade deal before the end of the year.
The Bank of England, which on Thursday kept interest rates unchanged, said market contacts had ""reported renewed concerns over recent Brexit developments"".
France warned against collapsing Brexit trade talks -- a step it said could suit some in London. 
""We shouldn't fall into the trap,"" said Clement Beaune, France's European affairs minister.
'DON'T LECTURE UK'
The intervention by Biden, who nationwide polls show leading the race for Nov. 3's U.S. election, prompted a sharp rebuke from an ex-leader of Johnson's Conservative Party, Iain Duncan Smith, who advised him to focus on ""riots"" rather than Brexit. 
""We don't need lectures on the Northern Ireland peace deal from Mr Biden,"" Duncan Smith told The Times. ""If I were him I would worry more about the need for a peace deal in the USA to stop the killing and rioting before lecturing other sovereign nations.""
Biden, who has talked about the importance of his Irish heritage, retweeted a letter from Eliot Engel, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, to Johnson exhorting him to honour the Good Friday deal.

Engel urged Johnson to ""abandon any and all legally questionable and unfair efforts to flout the Northern Ireland protocol of the Withdrawal Agreement"" so as to preserve peace in the province and good U.S-British relations.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - An old rivalry between Christian factions who fought each other in Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war has flared again on the street and in political debate, renewing fears of fresh unrest as the nation grapples with its worst crisis since the conflict.
Never far from the surface in the past three decades, the feud between supporters of Michel Aoun, now Lebanon's president, and Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces (LF) led to a tense standoff this week near Beirut. Gunshots rang out, but no one was hurt.
There were rival accounts about who fired in the air. But those on both sides, some born after the war, said Monday's events were a reminder of a long-running enmity, one of many in Lebanon's fractious sectarian system now facing new strains amid an economic meltdown.
The rivalry today is about more than Christian politics: Aoun is allied with Hezbollah, the heavily armed, Iran-backed Shi'ite party. Geagea spearheads opposition to Hezbollah, saying it should surrender its weapons.
""There are limits they cannot cross,"" said Elias al-Zoghby, a member of Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), saying an LF convoy of supporters waving flags had acted provocatively by driving towards his party's headquarters.
""We hope they'll remember the past and that nobody can win the game of the street,"" LF activist Toni Bader said, denying the FPM's account.
The standoff was the latest in a country that has seen sporadic violence intensify as an economic crisis that erupted last year has deepened. It was compounded by a huge blast that ripped through Beirut on Aug. 4. The government has resigned and efforts to form a new one under French pressure are floundering.
""The security situation is reaching a breaking point,"" said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center.
TROOPS DEPLOYED
Troops deployed to defuse Monday's face-off, which spiralled when Geagea supporters in cars and on motorcycles, waving LF flags and chanting partisan songs, drove near the FPM offices.
Geagea loyalists were marking the anniversary of the 1982 assassination of Bashir Gemayel, who founded what began as the LF militia. LF officials say their supporters were unarmed and only passing near the FPM offices when the other side fired.
FPM officials say the supporters of the LF, which disarmed at the end of the war, were threatening to attack. They said the guns were fired by security forces.
The army said shots were fired in the air without saying by whom. It said LF supporters had thrown stones at the FPM office.
One video showed men firing machine guns into the air. In another, men in masks cursed as they burned an LF flag.
""It became clear the street is really boiling again between them,"" said prominent journalist Nabil Boumonsef.
Both sides have called for restraint, while accusing each other of acting like a militia. Geagea, who led the LF militia forces, and Aoun, who commanded the army at the end of the civil war, have not themselves commented.
After the war, both leaders were forced out of political life as next door Syria dominated politics. Geagea was imprisoned and Aoun went into exile in France. Both returned to the scene in 2005 once Syrian troops withdrew from Lebanon.
Geagea has become more critical of FPM's record in government since last month's port blast.
Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai, leader of the Maronite church, who has influence as leader of Lebanon's biggest Christian community, has weighed in and called for change in the way Lebanon is governed. Aoun and Geagea are both Maronites.
Monday's incident was one of several events that have stoked tension. LF scouts, usually young party supporters, have staged prominent parades at party events. A group of about 20 LF loyalists, dressed in black uniforms, goose-stepped in formation through a Christian district of Beirut this week.

FPM members say these are provocative shows of strength. The LF says such parades are routine and the FPM's criticism is an attempt to hide its political failure.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union needs to hike its renewable energy and energy saving targets, according to its analysis published on Thursday of how the bloc could make deeper emissions cuts this decade.
The European Commission wants the EU to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, against 1990 levels, which experts say is the minimum needed to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
The tougher target has stirred resistance from industry and countries worried about the costs. The EU's current 2030 emissions target is for a 40% cut, though the bloc is on track for a deeper 45% cut. 
On Thursday the Commission insisted that the tougher goal is economically feasible.
""We have the policies, we have the commitment, we have the funds to support it,"" said EU climate chief Frans Timmermans. 
A 55% emissions reduction by 2030 would require the EU to target a 38%-40% share of renewable energy by 2030 and energy savings of 36%-39% by that date, the Commission said. 
The bloc is on track for a 33% renewables share by 2030, against an existing 32% goal. But countries are on course to miss by 3 percentage points the EU's goal of 32.5% energy savings by 2030.
The Commission laid out other steps that could drive decarbonisation - including tighter EU emissions standards for cars, adding shipping and possibly road transport and buildings to the EU carbon market, and reviewing fossil fuel taxation, confirming draft plans previously reported by Reuters.
It will table specific policy proposals by next summer.

It said expanding EU carbon pricing would help shore up funds as an additional energy investment of 350 billion euros a year from 2021 to 2030 would be needed, compared with the previous decade.

BIRMINGHAM/SOUTHEND-ON-SEA, England (Reuters) - Parents across England are facing a COVID-19 dilemma: their children are not allowed to return to school unless they have a negative coronavirus test, but it is fiendishly difficult to get one as the British testing system buckles.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who in May promised to create a ""world beating"" system to test and trace people exposed to the virus, said he sympathised with those unable to get a test but that the system was struggling with massive demand.
Across England, though, parents were frustrated.
Vinay Guwant, 44, said his son had developed a cough over the weekend and that his school had said he could only return if he had a negative test result. 
For three days, Guwant repeatedly tried and failed to get a test, waking up in the early hours and staying up past midnight to navigate the government's website and search for a test. 
He only got a test after a friend telephoned him to say slots were available. 
Guwant, who praised the staff who carried out his son’s test, blamed the problems on the IT system and said he worries it may struggle with an expected second wave of COVID-19 over coming months as England approaches winter. 
""If the system is this bad now you have to wonder how it will cope with the winter,"" he told Reuters at a testing centre at Birmingham University, in England's second-largest city. ""It needs drastic attention now.""
While the centre was quiet on Thursday, attempts by a Reuters reporter to book a test online were directed to a test centre 117 miles away in Accrington in northern England and another 362 miles away in Antrim in Northern Ireland.
British health officials say there is a lack of laboratory capacity though they have also blamed people for seeking tests without any symptoms.
For parents the problems were acute.
In Southend-on-Sea - 161 miles (260 km) east of Birmingham - parents faced a similar Catch-22.
""I've been trying online every hour on the hour for four days and I finally got an appointment last night,"" said Kelly Atkins, a local resident at a test centre.
""So yes, it's like winning the lottery, to be honest,"" Atkins said, adding that her children had symptoms too but trying to book a test for a family was a ""complete disaster"".
Back in Birmingham some said the public's compliance with the quarantine rules could crumble unless the testing system was fixed.

""My daughter has already missed so much school this year it has been a hard decision to keep her off,"" said Sophie Gray. ""We are all trying to do our best but the government has to put in place the right infrastructure for this to work.""

Japan's ties with China have been strained by the long-running row over the uninhabited East China Sea islets, called the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. 
""The Defence Ministry should conduct joint drills with the United States around the Nansei Islands chain including Kuba island and Taisho island,"" said the proposal, drafted by a group of ruling party lawmakers. 
Kuba and Taisho are part of what Japan calls the Senkaku islands.
Japan's latest defence white paper, published in July, said China's maritime and air forces have been stepping up their activities around the islands, creating a situation that warrants deep concerns. 

The proposal, which also calls for allocating more money, ships and personnel to the coastguard to bolster maritime law enforcement around the islands, will be submitted to the government next week.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A NATO investigation into a naval standoff between French and Turkish ships in June has been rated too sensitive to discuss in public and does not apportion blame, as Paris and Ankara wage a war of words, diplomats have told Reuters.
The issue underlines NATO's difficulties with Turkey, also at odds with Greece over energy rights and with the alliance's leader, the United States.
On June 10, a French frigate on a NATO mission tried to inspect a Tanzanian-flagged cargo ship suspected of smuggling arms to Libya.
France says the frigate was harassed by Turkish navy vessels escorting the cargo ship, and accuses Turkey of breaking a U.N. arms embargo. Turkey denies this, and says the frigate was aggressive.
It now seems unlikely that the investigation can resolve the spat. A NATO official confirmed the report had been finished, but declined further comment.
""It's been swept under the carpet,"" one European diplomat said.
Another said NATO's determination to keep Turkey onside, because of its military clout and strategic location, meant there was no willingness to point a finger.
And so both sides claim victory, and accusations continue to be traded.
French President Emmanuel Macron last week bemoaned the ""unacceptable behavior"" of his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan's government. Erdogan retorted: ""Don't mess with Turkey.""
The men are also at loggerheads over Greece, which disputes Turkey's right to explore for hydrocarbons in waters claimed by Greece or Cyprus.
France has demonstratively joined Greek naval exercises.
Here too, NATO is trying to do what it can to prevent untoward incidents, through ""deconfliction"" talks.
""It's unclear if there will be a result in these negotiations,"" said a senior NATO official. ""Every utterance from Paris, Ankara or Athens makes it even harder for allies to walk back from their positions.""
Disputes with Turkey within NATO are not new.
Last year, Turkey for a time refused to back a defense plan for the Baltics and Poland unless NATO offered political support for Ankara's fight against a Syrian Kurdish militia backed by Washington.
Turkey's purchase of Russia's S-400 air-defense system also appeared to be a snub to the United States and other allies.But it seems local tensions can for now be overlooked.

""Some of this is Macron wanting to be the big man in Europe, which is the same with Erdogan,"" said a U.S. envoy in Europe. ""There is a solution to be had with the Turks.""

400,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",BHP sought to disturb cultural sites even after concerns raised: inquiry,"By Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group (AX:BHP) pursued permission to damage Aboriginal cultural sites in April, an Australian parliamentary inquiry heard on Thursday, despite being told of the distress it would cause traditional owners.
The inquiry is investigating Rio Tinto's (AX:RIO) legal detonation in May of sacred and historically significant rockshelters for an iron ore mine at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia's Pilbara region. 
Rio's Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques and two deputies stepped down last week following a public outcry, the deep upset of the traditional owners and the discontent from institutional investors who called for management to better account for the damage. 
BHP executives David Bunting, the company's Australian Heritage Manager, and Libby Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), Head of Indigenous Engagement, testified about the company's application to disturb 40 sacred sites of the Banjima indigenous group as part of its $2.9 billion South Flank mine expansion in the Pilbara.
The Banjima ""did provide feedback through BHP that there were concerns around some of the places"" that would be disturbed, said Ferrari. ""They were able to and did air their views quite clearly with us and with the regulator.""
Both Ferrari and Bunting noted that the Banjima did not object to the South Flank expansion, but also acknowledged that the consent agreement between BHP and the Banjima does not allow them to legally object to the destruction of sacred sites.
However, an April 16, 2020, letter from Banjima Native Title Aboriginal Corporation Chief Executive Officer Joanna Ramsey submitted as part of BHP's application contains heartfelt objections to their destruction.
In the letter reviewed by Reuters, Banjima Corporation Chairman Maitland Parker says, ""that while he knows Banjima cannot object to the application, this in no way diminishes the cumulative loss that Banjima people feel each and every time significant places ... are to be harmed.""
Parker added that he wanted future generations to ""know we didn't just sign off on this stuff and forget about it, we put up a fight about these places.""
The Western Australia Minister for Aboriginal Affairs approved BHP's application on May 29, just days after the news that Rio destroyed the Juukan Gorge sites. 
Of more than 480 applications by miners to disturb significant sites in the past 10 years to July, all but one have been approved.
In her testimony on Thursday, Ferrari said that BHP was working under the consents that are currently in place. 
""Would we have done things differently in hindsight? Possibly."" 
BHP pledged on June 11 not to disturb any of the Banjima sites without further study and consultation.
Edgar Basto, the head of BHP's Australian operations, said the miner is focusing on improving its approach to better protect heritage sites in a process of deep engagement with traditional owners.
BHP said last week it would set up a heritage committee with senior Banjima elders to improve consultation and communication around heritage sites. 
BHP has also clarified that Aboriginal owners are free to comment on the management of their cultural heritage, and is reviewing clauses around consent in its agreements.
However, BHP, like Rio and  Fortescue Metals  Group (AX:FMG) have stopped short of supporting the right of Aboriginal groups to veto the destruction of sacred sites.

401,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 08:51AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Suspected arms dealers moved millions in Somali money transfers, report says","By Katharine Houreld
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Somali money transfer companies moved more than $3.7 million in cash between suspected weapons traffickers in recent years, including to a Yemeni under U.S. sanctions for alleged militant links, according to a report seen by Reuters.
The findings by a Geneva-based research group, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, could further complicate attempts by Somali transfer companies to retain access to international banking services. 
Though they provide a lifeline to millions in the anarchic Horn of Africa nation, few banks will do business with them because of the risk of falling foul of international transparency and anti-money laundering regulations.
Asked about the report, the Central Bank of Somalia, which regulates money transfer firms, said it was unaware of the transfers but would investigate and was in general making progress in countering terrorism financing. 
Contacted by Reuters, the four companies each said they did their best to comply with global ""know your customer"" norms despite Somalia having no national identity card. The firms also said they maintained databases of internationally-sanctioned individuals.
The Global Initiative analysed nearly six years of transaction records from the city of Bossasso, matching them with mobile phone records provided by security sources and database searches.
The report identified 176 transactions from the last six years that it said appeared to be linked to suspected weapons dealers in Somalia and Yemen. Nearly two-thirds were over the $10,000 threshold that should trigger an automatic report to regulatory authorities. 
They include two transfers totalling nearly $40,000 to numbers linked to Sayf Abdulrab Salem al-Hayashi after the U.S. Treasury sanctioned him in 2017 for allegedly providing weapons and financial support to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Islamic State in Yemen, the report said.
Al Hayashi could not be reached for comment. 
Somalia-based Amal Express and Iftin Express handled the transactions, which used different combinations of his name and nickname, the report said.
Amal Express said a transfer slip shown in the report and allegedly linked to al Hayashi was a forgery. Iftin Express said the transaction slip was a fake and added that it reported all transactions over $10,000 to Somali authorities. 
MULTIPLE IDENTITIES 
The report did not find any instances where the other two companies, Dahabshiil and Taaj, made transfers to any sanctioned individuals. But it noted instances where individuals were able to make transfers with them using multiple names and numbers, a violation of Somali law. 
One man used 24 names between the four companies, the report said.
All four companies said they did not allow customers to use multiple identities or phone numbers. Dahabshiil also said it has stopped doing transfers between Somalia and Yemen. 
The companies did not say whether the six men named in the report are in their databases. 
Apart from al Hayashi - the only one under U.S. sanctions - three others whose names appear in the suspect transactions were identified as suspected arms dealers in public reports by the United Nations panel of experts on Somalia. 
Two were flagged - one as a proxy for al Hayashi, and one as an arms trafficker - in a confidential annex to a 2018 report by the same panel. 
Few Somalis have bank accounts. Money transfer companies - often known as hawalas - are vital to economic activity and delivering humanitarian aid. 
Cutting companies off from banking is not the answer, said the report's author, Jay Bahadur, former head of the U.N. panel of experts. ""Excluding companies from international banking services will punish families that rely on them and drive financial flows underground,"" he said. 
IDENTITY CARD
But he said companies must ensure their agents follow anti-money laundering laws and Somali authorities must improve enforcement. 
""Financial regulatory bodies in Somalia are understaffed, under-resourced, and aren't trusted by domestic financial institutions,"" he told Reuters. ""They receive limited reporting data and aren't able to take much action with what they do receive.""
Abdirahman M. Abdullahi, governor of Somalia's central bank, said cooperation was improving. Somalia is working with the World Bank on developing a national identity card, he told Reuters.
He said arrests have been made for breaking anti-money laundering and terrorism financing law, citing the case of a trader convicted in August of running an unregistered bank.

The Financial Reporting Center, a Somali government watchdog, did not respond to requests for comment.

Those who jumped into the sea, part of a group of more than 270 people, were picked up by Italian coastguard and police ships.
The charity vessel carried out three separate rescue operations in the central Mediterranean between Sept. 8 and 10. The crew are still waiting for instructions on where the migrants will be allowed to disembark.
The Italian coastguard have transferred two pregnant women and one of their husbands onto land for medical assistance in recent days.
After being for years the primary route into Europe for hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and other migrants, Italy has seen a drop in arrivals after a crackdown on smuggling networks.

However, numbers have picked up again in 2020 although Rome banned rescue ships from docking in its ports due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sometimes those saved at sea are transferred to ferries and quarantined there, off the Italian coast.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's military-backed prime minister warned protesters on Thursday against heightening COVID-19 risks as they planned large anti-government demonstrations for the weekend. 
Demonstrators have held two months of near-daily rallies to demand former junta leader Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's removal and changes to a constitution they say were designed to extend military dominance after an election last year. 
Prayuth, a former army chief who says he was fairly elected, said in a televised speech that he understood the grievances but urged demonstrators to put ""COVID first"" for now. 
""When you gather in mobs, you are creating an enormous risk of new infections. And with that, you also create enormous risk to the livelihoods of tens of millions of fellow Thais,"" he said. 
""Your protests delay economic recovery because you affect business confidence, and you affect the confidence of tourists to return to our country when we are ready to receive them.""
Thailand has not seen a local coronavirus transmission for 14 days since Sept. 3, when a prison inmate tested positive after over 100 days of no new local cases. 
Foes say Prayuth is exploiting the health situation. 
""COVID is the government's last card, the only trick left up its sleeve, to undermine the legitimacy of the protests,"" said Anusorn Unno, a protester and lecturer at Bangkok's Thammasat University.
Protest leaders expect tens of thousands to gather at that university on Saturday and march to Government House on Sunday. 
The university said last week it would not allow the gathering on its campus. Police also said marching to Government House could break a law prohibiting large gatherings near restricted sites. 

The demonstrations, though largely peaceful, have revived memories of more than a decade of intermittent unrest and protracted street rallies that culminated in a 2014 coup led by Prayuth against the government of Yingluck Shinawatra.

In an overwhelming show of support for pro-democracy protesters in Belarus, the EU assembly voted 574 to 37, with 82 abstentions, to reject the official results of an Aug. 9 presidential election that the West says was rigged.
""The EU needs a new approach toward Belarus, which includes the termination of any cooperation with Lukashenko's regime,"" said Petras Austrevicius, a Lithuanian centrist EU lawmaker heading parliament's efforts to pressure Belarus' top officials.

407,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 08:16AM ET</span>",Curiosity high for TV's anything-can-happen virtual Emmys,"By Jill Serjeant
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California may be burning and the United States is in the midst of the novel coronavirus pandemic, but Hollywood is hoping that there might be some relief in a party - albeit at a distance - at Sunday's Emmy awards.
The highest awards in television are going ahead as a live, virtual ceremony, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, but without a celebrity audience or a red carpet, after six months of lockdowns, no live concerts and a lost summer movie season.
""Television has really dominated and helped people in the last six months of pandemic. So there perhaps is a sense of wanting to see how these things we discovered during quarantine, or watched again, will fare on Sunday,"" said Gerrad Hall, senior TV editor at Entertainment Weekly.
Emmy producers say they have thrown out the awards show playbook and are looking to do something fun and unexpected, while cognizant of massive wildfires, the pandemic and a divisive presidential election campaign.
""We are not tone deaf. We are trying to make this show in the backdrop of a lot of things going on in this country,"" co-producer Ian Stewart told reporters.
Television proved an escape for millions during the lockdowns but many of the shows up for Emmys are far from frivolous in a line-up that is stronger than ever on diversity.
""Watchmen"" based on a comic book but infused with themes of racial injustice, goes into Sunday's ceremony with a leading 26 nods and is expected to end up one of the night's biggest winners.
""It's big in scope, and its message of institutional racism and diving deep into this country's history of inequality couldn't be more timely,"" said Michael Schneider, senior editor at Variety.
Schneider called ""Watchmen"" a ""dead cert"" to win the Emmy for best limited series, with Regina King's kick ass police detective seen as favorite for best actress. 
The best drama series race appears to be a close contest between money laundering thriller ""Ozark,"" starring Jason Bateman and Laura Linney, and squabbling media family saga ""Succession,"" whose cunning patriarch is played by Brian Cox.
""It's strange in this day and age to see people rooting and caring so much for rich white people, but there is also a thrill in watching them squirm,"" said Hall, talking of ""Succession.""
Both shows, which tied with 18 Emmy nods, ""benefited from all the binge watching that people did during quarantine,"" Hall added.
By contrast ""Schitt's Creek,"" a leading contender for best comedy series honors, is a quirky feel good show about a rich family forced to live in a run-down motel. It also got nods for writing, directing and for its four main actors - Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Daniel Levy and Annie Murphy.
Previous Emmy champ ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" is also in the running but sentiment appears to be with ""Schitt's Creek,"" which went from obscurity to a fan favorite in its 6th and final season.

The Emmy Awards will be broadcast live on ABC on Sunday, starting at 8 pm ET/5 pm PT.

Since coming to power in 2015, Poland's nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party has introduced a series of judicial reforms undermining the independence of the courts by putting them under more direct government control, critics say.
In 2017 the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, triggered an investigation against Poland, which has not resulted in any punishment for Warsaw so far. 
""(The European Parliament) expresses its deep concern that... the rule of law situation in Poland has not only not been addressed but has seriously deteriorated since the triggering of the procedure referred to in Article 7,"" a resolution adopted by the parliament said.
Activists, the opposition in Poland and some European politicians have long called on the bloc to tie EU money to adherence to the rule of law. But instead Poland will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new EU budget.

EU Parliament deputies said on Thursday they saw an urgent need to widen the scope of the procedure triggered in 2017 by including clear risks of serious breaches of other basic values of the Union, especially democracy and respect for human rights.

409,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>",China to Make Decision on WHO Vaccine Program Snubbed by Trump,"(Bloomberg) -- China faces a major test in its vaccine diplomacy, with a deadline fast approaching on whether it will officially join a World Health Organization-backed effort to ensure everyone across the globe is inoculated against Covid-19.
Friday is the final day for governments to decide whether to take part in Covax, an $18 billion initiative that aspires to give lower-income countries the same access to vaccines as wealthier nations. Beijing has said it “supports” Covax without clearly saying if it’s putting any money into the project.
Signing up would help to repair China’s image around the world over how it handled the initial outbreak in Wuhan, particularly since the Trump administration has refused to join Covax. So far, Beijing has focused on cutting one-on-one deals for vaccine doses with friendly governments as the U.S. urges nations to shun Chinese companies for 5G networks, computer chips and big infrastructure projects.
“Beijing is battling criticism from the West over the origin of Covid-19 in Wuhan and China’s transparency around the early days of the virus spread,” said Kelsey Broderick, an analyst at Eurasia Group. “Joining a popular initiative like Covax would certainly help shift the perception that China is a bad actor.”
President Xi Jinping in May promised that vaccines developed by China will be a global “public good” that can be shared by all. Still, China hasn’t clarified if it will sign up, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying only saying this month that China’s actions are “in essence the same with Covax.”
Covax, which is also led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the vaccine alliance Gavi, is designed to give governments an opportunity to hedge the risk of backing unsuccessful vaccine candidates and give less developed countries access to shots that would be otherwise unaffordable. It currently has nine vaccines in development and nine under evaluation in its portfolio. The goal is to secure 2 billion doses by 2021.
China Expects Virus Vaccine to Be Ready in November, Expert SaysSelf-financing countries can pay up front for vaccine doses that would cover as much as 50% of their populations, though shots would be proportionally distributed among poor and rich countries alike as they become available. Governments that sign up are free to reach bilateral deals to secure supplies separately.Having China on board would be a big deal for Covax, which had some 172 countries in discussion to participate as of Aug. 24. The possibility of providing doses to even a fraction of China’s 1.4 billion people would boost critical mass, enhancing the alliance’s negotiating power.For China, Covax could act as a kind of insurance policy that allows it access to any successfully developed vaccine. While being a member doesn’t necessarily mean Chinese vaccines will be included in Covax’s portfolio, it’s probable that’ll be the case. China could also provide manufacturing support for a successful vaccine, regardless of which country develops it.Participation could mean that Chinese vaccine manufacturers play a significant role in the global roll-out. And if a Chinese-developed vaccine were selected their brands would benefit from WHO certification, according to Xiaoqing Lu Boynton, a consultant at Albright Stonebridge Group who focuses on health care and life sciences.
“It would be a big boost for Beijing both from the industry perspective as well as politically,” she said.
Diplomatic Angle
China doesn’t have much experience in manufacturing and distributing a vaccine for global consumption. The industry’s reputation took a hit in 2018 when two Chinese vaccine-makers were found to have cut corners in production, undermining confidence both at home and abroad.Still, China has been a front-runner in developing vaccines against the coronavirus. Nine of China’s vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials, and four of them got approval for final stage Phase III clinical trials in foreign countries.
Biden Embraces Vaccines, Science: ‘I Don’t Trust Donald Trump’Tianjin-based CanSino was the first in the world to reach the crucial final stage of human testing for a vaccine it co-developed with the Chinese military. CanSino Biologics, Sinovac Biotech Ltd. and China National Biotec Group have kicked off testing in countries including Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Peru, Chile and Morocco.
The vaccine could help Beijing make up lost diplomatic ground as China comes under fire for threats to Taiwan as well as human-rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. China has promised to prioritize providing doses for at least 62 countries, including governments that have received infrastructure loans under Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative. Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Morocco have formal agreements with China’s major vaccine manufacturers, and Egypt is close to signing one.
“Both the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises would much like to protect their own infrastructure projects as well as personnel on the ground,” said Yu Jie, senior research fellow on China at think tank Chatham House. “If the epidemiological situation improves across those countries, it would help China too.”
Latin American and Caribbean countries have been promised a $1 billion loan to purchase a Chinese designed vaccine. Currently, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, and Argentina have all made commitments to testing a Chinese vaccine. The region remains the hardest hit, with Brazil, Mexico and Peru among the world’s top 10 countries by total Covid-related deaths.
Trusting China
Sill, a global lack of trust in China due to Xi’s more aggressive foreign policy makes the international community doubtful of China’s behavior and intentions, said Yoshikazu Kato, an adjunct professor at the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong who specializes in Chinese diplomacy.“Under these circumstances, how can countries trust China?” he said.
An incident involving CanSino and Canada underscored concerns that China could use its vaccine for political purposes. The Chinese company was supposed to send its vaccine candidate so that clinical trials could begin in Canada, but Chinese customs hasn’t approved the shipments, according to the National Research Council Canada.Malaysia is in talks with many parties, including China. “We have more questions than answers at the moment,” said Noor Hisham Abdullah, the Southeast Asian nation’s Director General of Health. Vietnam, which has sparred with Beijing over territorial disputes in the South China Sea, last month agreed to purchase millions of doses of Russia’s vaccine, and it’s developing a national one expected to be ready late next year.
Not everyone is concerned. The Philippines, which has expressed a willingness to accept a vaccine from the U.S., Russia, and China, rejected any notion that China may be using the vaccine to curry diplomatic favors. “No such concern about China’s vaccine at all,” said Teodoro Locsin, the Philippine foreign affairs secretary.“I think that it’s in China’s interest to join,” said Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China’s cabinet and founder of the Center for China and Globalization, referring to Covax. “If the world is still in the pandemic, China will not be in good shape either.”

The police operation launched early on Thursday including 70 female officers, was intended to provide migrants with shelter, food and to protect public health, government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters.
""The operation began with many officers in white body suits, things are calm and migrants are slowly streaming into the new camp,"" a Reuters witness said.
The fire that gutted the Moria facility a week ago left over 12,000 people, most of them refugees from Afghanistan, Syria and various African countries, without shelter, proper sanitation or access to food and water.
Authorities said the fire was started by migrants. No one was hurt.
The new temporary tent camp at Kara Tepe, near the island's port of Mytilene, is ready to take in at least 8,000 people, but officials have said that some of the migrants were reluctant to move to the new camp as they hoped to leave the island.
Groups of migrants carrying their luggage in shopping carts walked to the camp, Reuters images showed.
""The operation will continue until all those who are on the streets are sheltered,"" a police official said, declining to be named.
Early on Wednesday, only 1,200 had moved voluntarily but more streamed in later in the day. By Thursday afternoon the Kara Tepe tent camp housed 3,000 and 77 migrants had been found COVID-19 positive, a government official said.
Petsas said ""it was a matter of a few days"" for migrants to be completely resettled. 

Government ministers have said authorities would continue ""for some more days in good faith and communication"" to convince the migrants to enter the new camp, expecting their transfer would be completed within a few days. [L8N2GD3PD]

412,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>","Burundi impunity for abuses continues, says U.N. report, as another mass grave opened","GENEVA/NAIROBI (Reuters) - Impunity for rape, murder and other abuses is still widespread in Burundi despite a change of government, a U.N. report released on Thursday said.
The report comes days after Burundi's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is examining past atrocities and investigating mass graves, issued rare criticism of local leaders in charge during a 1972 massacre. 
The U.N. report said there had been numerous rights abuses in Burundi connected to elections held in May. The new president, retired general Evariste Ndayishimiye, took power in June. He formerly served as the interior minister. 
Ndayishimiye has promoted high-ranking military officers involved in human rights abuses, appointed some military officers to governorships previously held by civilians, and included two men in his cabinet under sanctions for rights violations, the report noted.
The security forces and youth wing of the ruling party, the Imbonerakure, continue to have almost total impunity for beatings, kidnappings and sexual violence, the report said.
A presidential spokesman referred questions for comment to the foreign ministry, which was not immediately available. 
Ndayishimiye's speech at his inauguration had hinted he hoped to make a break from the abuses committed under his predecessor, a former leader of a Hutu militia who took power in 1995 following 12 years of civil war.
Burundi has the same ethnic make-up as neighbouring Rwanda, whose 1994 genocide by Hutu militias killed around 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. 
Burundi has also suffered periodic bouts of ethnic violence, and established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to recover the remains of victims. But its mandate only covers the period until 2008, ignoring the most recent episodes of political violence.
On Tuesday, the commission's president gave a rare speech that singled out local officials he said were responsible for a 1972 massacre, and said the group would question them.
Although the commission has opened dozens of mass graves, it rarely names those responsible for the violence. 
Pierre Claver Ndayicariye was speaking as the group opened eight mass graves at Gikizi in the southern province of Bururi. 
Most of the victims buried in the grave were Hutus, said Sinabajije Bonaventure, who was 20 at the time of the massacre. He said his younger brother was among the villagers taken to the court house and shot dead by security forces.

""We dug mass graves and buried them here, my little brother was among them,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian police have filed charges against 15 people over Hindu-Muslim riots in the capital, a spokesman said on Thursday, prompting criticism from rights groups that authorities were targeting the opposition and minority Muslims.
February's violence killed more than 50 people and drove thousands from their homes, most of them members of the Muslim minority, which forms about 15% of a population of roughly 1.3 billion. 
The riots followed months of sometimes violent protests against a new citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims.
The charges were filed in a court in eastern New Delhi, said police spokesman Anil Mittal, adding that the evidence against the accused runs to more than 17,000 pages. 
Mittal did not identify those charged, but domestic media have named former members of two opposition parties and academics at one of the main protest sites, the Muslim-dominated university of Jamia Millia Islamia.
""By arbitrarily arresting outspoken activists, the government is not only attempting to silence dissent but also sending a message to supporters that they have free rein to commit abuses against minority communities,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch. 
Prashant Bhushan, a Supreme Court lawyer and vocal government critic, said the charge sheet was ""farcical"". 
Broadcaster NDTV called the investigation a ""whitewash"", adding that several members of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party made incendiary speeches hours before February's riots but had escaped censure. 
The government and Delhi police have defended their handling of the case, saying those involved in the riots will be punished regardless of political or religious ties.

OSLO (Reuters) - This year's Nobel Peace Prize could go to green campaigner Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement to highlight the link between environmental damage and the threat to peace and security, some experts say.
The winner of the $1 million prize, arguably the world's top accolade, will be announced in Oslo on Oct. 9 from a field of 318 candidates. The prize can be split up to three ways.
The Swedish 17-year-old was nominated by three Norwegian lawmakers and two Swedish parliamentarians and if she wins, she would receive it at the same age as Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai, the youngest Nobel laureate thus far.
Asle Sveen, a historian and author of several books about the prize, said Thunberg would be a strong candidate for this year's award, her second nomination in as many years, with the U.S. West Coast wildfires and rising temperatures in the Arctic ""leaving people in no doubt"" about global warming.
""Not a single person has done more to get the world to focus on climate change than her,"" Sveen told Reuters.
The committee has given the prize to environmentalists before, starting with Kenya's Wangari Maathai in 2004 for her campaign to plant 30 million trees across Africa, and in 2007 to Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
In the era of the coronavirus crisis, the committee could also choose to highlight the threat of pandemics to peace and security, said Dan Smith, the director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. 
""There is a relationship between environmental damage and our increasing problem with pandemics and I wonder whether the Nobel Peace Prize Committee might want to highlight that,"" he told Reuters. 
If the committee wanted to highlight this trend, he said, ""there is obviously the temptation of Greta Thunberg"".
The Fridays for Future movement started in 2018 when Thunberg began a school strike in Sweden to push for action on climate. It has since become a global protest.
Thunberg and her father Svante, who sometimes handles media queries for her, did not reply to requests for comment.
Many were sceptical when Greta, as she is often referred to, became the bookmaker's favourite to win last year's Nobel Peace Prize, especially with regards to her age, but her second nomination could strengthen her chances.
The Irish betting agency Paddy Power has the World Health Organization (WHO) as its favourite at odds of 5/2, followed by Thunberg at 3/1 and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern at 5/1.
""Greta is re-nominated, which was the case for Malala. I said Malala was young when she was nominated the first time and I said Greta was young the first time she was nominated,"" Sveen said. 
Yousafzai won in 2014.
Graphic of Nobel laureates: http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/NOBEL-PRIZE/010050ZC27H/index.html 
NOT TRUMP
Other known candidates included the ""people of Hong Kong"", NATO, Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden and jailed Saudi activist Loujain al-Hathloul.
Other possible choices are Reporters Without Borders, Angela Merkel and the WHO, experts said, though it is unclear whether they are nominated.
Nominations are secret for 50 years but those who nominate can choose to publicise their choices. Thousands of people are eligible to nominate, including members of parliaments and governments, university professors and past laureates.
It is not known whether Donald Trump is nominated for this year's prize, though he is up for next year's award after a Norwegian lawmaker named the U.S. President for helping broker a deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.
He is unlikely to win, Sveen and Smith agreed, not least for his dismantling of the international treaties to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons, a cause dear to Nobel committees.

""He is divisive and seems to not take a clear stance against the violence the right-wing perpetrates in the U.S.,"" said Smith.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The nerve agent used to poison Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was detected on an empty water bottle from his hotel room in the Siberian city of Tomsk, suggesting he was poisoned there and not at the airport as first thought, his team said on Thursday.
Navalny fell violently ill on a flight in Russia last month and was airlifted to Berlin for treatment. Laboratories in Germany, France and Sweden have established he was poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent, a poison developed by the Soviet military, though Russia denies this and says it has seen no evidence.
A video posted on Navalny's Instagram account showed members of his team searching the room he had just left in the Xander Hotel in Tomsk on Aug. 20, an hour after they learned he had fallen sick in suspicious circumstances.
""It was decided to gather up everything that could even hypothetically be useful and hand it to the doctors in Germany. The fact that the case would not be investigated in Russia was quite obvious,"" the post said.
The video of the abandoned hotel room shows two water bottles on a desk, and another on a bedside table. Navalny's team, wearing protective gloves, are seen placing items into blue plastic bags.
""Two weeks later, a German laboratory found traces of Novichok precisely on the bottle of water from the Tomsk hotel room,"" the post said. 
""And then more laboratories that took analyses from Alexei confirmed that that was what poisoned Navalny. Now we understand: it was done before he left his hotel room to go to the airport.""
Previously, Navalny's aides had said they suspected he had been poisoned with a cup of tea he drank at Tomsk airport.
Vladimir Milov, a former deputy energy minister and an ally of Navalny, said his team had outmanoeuvred the FSB security police with their quick thinking: ""They took the evidence from under their noses and shipped it out of the country.""
Navalny's ally Georgy Alburov told Reuters ""the bottles flew with Alexei"" when he was airlifted to Germany on Aug. 22.
PUTIN FOE
Navalny is the most prominent political opponent of President Vladimir Putin, even though he has not been allowed to form his own party. His investigations of official corruption, published on YouTube and Instagram, have reached audiences of many millions across Russia.
Germany, France, Britain and other nations have demanded explanations from Russia, and there have been calls for new sanctions against Moscow.
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said on Thursday that Germany had asked it for technical assistance. [nL8N2GE1NR]
Russia has carried out pre-investigation checks, but said it needs to see more medical analysis before it can open a formal criminal investigation.
Novichok was used to poison former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury in 2018. They survived, but a member of the public, Dawn Sturgess, died after picking up a contaminated bottle. Moscow also denied carrying out that attack.
Members of the OPCW agreed in November 2019 to expand the agency's list of banned ""Schedule 1"" chemicals for the first time to include Novichok nerve agents. That ban went into effect last June. 
Anton Timofeyev, a member of Navalny's team who was shown in the video gathering the samples from the hotel, said he had been mindful of the Skripal case at that moment.

""We were thinking some hotel maid will go and grab these bottles,"" he told Reuters. ""Of course, they would have been poisoned.""

419,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 06:21AM ET</span>","In occupied West Bank, Palestinian bloggers see local tourism as defiance","ARTAS, West Bank (Reuters) - Two Palestinian travel bloggers are promoting local Palestinian tourism in the West Bank as an act of defiance against Israeli occupation.
The West Bank is scattered with sites holy to Christians, Muslims and Jews, and its mountainous landscape offers breathtaking views from the hills of Hebron and Nablus down to the hypersaline Dead Sea, the lowest point on earth. 
But after its capture by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, the West Bank has also been home to Israeli military bases and checkpoints that restrict Palestinian movement, as well nearly 430,000 Israeli settlers who live among 3 million Palestinians. 
Israel cites security concerns for the checkpoints in a volatile area it calls by its biblical name, Judea and Samaria.
Hoping to allay the fears of Palestinians who avoid visiting remote sites, Malak Hasan and Bisan Alhajhasan founded ""Ahlan Falasteen"" - meaning ""Hello Palestine"" - a blog and Instagram page offering travel destinations and advice. 
""The idea of two young female Palestinians who visit places that people feel are too far, or that might be closed, or are scared because of settlers or Israeli soldiers, we go there to show them that we should not abandon those places,"" said Alhajhasan, 32.
""This is part of our struggle as Palestinians,"" Alhajhasan said, taking Instagram videos at a 19th-century monastery in Artas village, south of Bethlehem.
Driving to Artas from the Palestinian hub city of Ramallah involves crossing at least one Israeli checkpoint and bypassing several others, an approximately 50-km (30-mile) route that without restrictions would be around half the distance. 
The bloggers' Instagram page features dozens of sites including several hillside springs popular with Palestinians and Israelis alike.
They have gained more than 5,600 followers since launching the app in May. They say it aims in part to show Palestinians new local destinations while international travel is restricted.

""We hear from shop owners that lots of people are visiting them after hearing about us,"" said Hasan, 31. ""We feel like we filled a gap.""

420,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 06:16AM ET</span>",China says will make 'necessary response' to U.S. official's Taiwan visit,"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China will make a ""necessary response"" to a visit by U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach to Chinese-claimed Taiwan, and has lodged a complaint with Washington, the foreign ministry said on Thursday ahead of his arrival.
Krach, who arrived in Taipei on Thursday afternoon, is in Taiwan for a memorial service on Saturday for former President Lee Teng-hui, who was revered by many on the island and internationally as the father of Taiwan's democracy. 
Krach is expected to meet Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday.
His visit follows one last month by U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar, the highest-level U.S. official to come to the democratic island in four decades.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said China has lodged ""stern representations"" with Washington about Krach's trip, and that it opposed any official exchanges between the United States and Taiwan.
The visit will give succour to the forces of Taiwan independence and damage Sino-U.S. ties, Wang said.
""We urge the U.S. side to fully recognise the extreme sensitivity of the Taiwan issue,"" Wang said. ""China will make a necessary response depending on how the situation develops.""
He did not give details. 
Relations between China and the United States have nosedived in recent months, with disagreements over Taiwan, trade, human rights, the coronavirus pandemic and other issues.
China views Taiwan's president as a dangerous separatist. She says the island is already an independent country called the Republic of China, Taiwan's formal name.
Krach is also likely to hold at least some form of trade talks during his trip, though details have not been announced.
Taiwan has long sought a free trade deal with the United States, but Washington has complained about barriers to access for U.S. pork and beef. Taiwan said that was for health reasons, especially with concern over mad cow disease and additives.
However, late last month, Tsai said her government could ease restrictions on pork and beef imports, allowing in U.S. pork containing ractopamine, an additive that enhances leanness, and allow in U.S. beef from cattle more than 30 months old.

But this has run into domestic objections. Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang, last weekend began collecting signatures for a referendum to block the pork imports, saying ractopamine was a health threat.

421,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","Defying protests and poverty, Haitians get creative to wed in style","PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - As anti-government protesters in Haiti's capital blocked principal roads and clashed with police last year, Stanley Joseph and Daphne Gerard used the city's winding and potholed backroads to make it to church for their wedding, decked out in all their finery.
The bride had wondered if they should postpone their big day when it became clear a majority of their guests would not make it, due to the violent unrest that had gripped Port-au-Prince for months.
But they had spent a lot of money and time planning. 
Joseph, 36, felt they could make it work, although that meant chartering a plane to bring Gerard's parents up from the country's south-east. 
Such is Haiti, where couples often have to surmount seemingly endless obstacles, from unrest and hurricanes to power outages and, above all, poverty, to get wed. 
But wed they do, and in style.
""We always have problems in Haiti. You can't wait. You just have to get on and overcome them,"" said Joseph, who wore a silver suit and lilac tie and boutonniere, matching the bridesmaids' lilac dresses. ""I was stressed but happy.""
Marriage is not as widespread in Haiti as in other Western countries, given the long-standing Creole tradition of 'plasaj,' an informal marital relationship that is common in rural areas but not legally recognized.
Yet marriage has greater prestige and is particularly favored by Haiti's wealthier, cosmopolitan urbanites, according to Haitian sociologist Tamas Jean Pierre - not least because it is recognized abroad.
Protestant churchgoing communities also favor marriage, especially if a couple is expecting a child. Some religious schools will only accept pupils if their parents can provide a marriage certificate.
""Often the reverend himself puts pressure on the couple, saying it is the will of God, which you cannot disobey,"" said Haitian ethnologist Isaac Ducléon.
Plasaj does not grant rights such as child support in the event of separation, or a share of a partner's estate if they die.
""I fell pregnant and, as we are both churchgoers, we decided to get married,"" said Johanne Jean, 38, who wed one month after giving birth, nursing her baby throughout the day.
SHINDIG ON A SHOESTRING
Still, in a country where more than half the population lives under the poverty line of $2.41 per day, only the wealthiest of Haitian couples can afford the full shebang of a wedding ceremony, lavish dinner reception, and honeymoon. 
Most have to get creative. Sometimes multiple couples get married at the same time to save on church fees.
They might skip the reception or, in the countryside, offer a simple meal of bread, fried plantains, rice and coffee. Sometimes, the whole village might provide food. Disputes can occur when there is not enough for all those who turn up, or when guests try to take home dishes or drinks.
Usually the cake is not big enough for everyone to have a piece so it is put on display during the wedding and consumed later at home by the couple and their nearest and dearest.
The couple may hire a pickup truck or motorbike taxis for the day to ferry people around. Or they may just walk to church, sweating up and down hills in their wedding clothes in the tropical heat.
Despite tight pursestrings, the showiness of the ceremony is the one element of the Haitian wedding that never lacks.
""It's partly about expressing your social status,"" said Jean Pierre. ""Even the poorest women make an effort to have a beautiful wedding, which for them means a big eye-catching procession that people will talk about for a long time.""
The bridal procession in church can include friends playing the part of a king and queen, while the bridesmaids and groomsmen often dress so similarly to the bride and groom that it can be difficult to define, from outside, who is actually getting wed.
DIASPORIC SUPPORT 
If a couple has relatives abroad willing to be the 'godparents' or witnesses, these will typically make a financial contribution to the wedding, including buying and shipping the bride's dress, usually a bouffant white gown.
Reggae singer Mirla-Samuelle Pierre, 32, said her cousin who lives in New York and was her wedding godmother purchased her dress, shoes, gloves and tall sparkling crown.
""I wanted to be different to everyone else so I got the tallest one there was,"" said Pierre, who married her drummer and composer bandmate Duckyns St-Eloi, better known as 'Zikiki'.
She wed in church, mainly to please her parents. But the theme of the wedding decoration was 'rastafari,' reflecting the culture of the dreadlocked groom.
Zikiki, 38, wore a red, black, green and gold scarf over his white suit and surprised his bride as she arrived in church by belting out the jazz song ""What a Wonderful World.""
Like all but the wealthiest Haitians, they chose not to spend any money on a grand reception or honeymoon.

""Instead, that same evening we went out to a nightclub,"" said Zikiki, ""and we had a lot of fun together.""

MANILA (Reuters) - A new Philippine telecoms firm with Chinese state investment on Thursday described as ""truly misplaced"" concerns that communications equipment it will install at military camps will be used for spying.
The Philippine government last week allowed DITO Telecommunity Corp, a joint venture between state-run China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) and a tycoon close to President Rodrigo Duterte, to erect towers on military land for its $5.15 billion entry into the market, which includes 5G technology.
The consortium was the only qualified bidder in a 2018 license auction that followed months of Duterte saying he had offered China a spot in the Philippines' telecom sector. China Telecom owns 40% of DITO.
But some lawmakers complain DITO could be a ""Trojan Horse"" for spying, including on a military allied with the United States. 
""We are not at war with China so this concern about espionage and spying I feel is truly misplaced,"" Adel Tamano, a top DITO official, told a news conference.
DITO's equipment and devices are not a security risk, Tamano said, adding that it is investing heavily in cybersecurity.
No Chinese personnel will be allowed inside camps, he said, and a retired Philippine general and telecoms expert had been hired to ensure cybersecurity.
However, former Supreme Court judge Antonio Carpio, a staunch critic of Duterte's pro-China stance, in a newspaper column on Thursday said Beijing ""would surely eavesdrop"". Opposition lawmaker Risa Hontiveros wants a senate probe on DITO's military deal.
Like competitors Globe and PLDT (NYSE:PHI), DITO also uses equipment from Chinese firms Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763).
DITO is 60% controlled by Duterte associate Dennis Uy, whose conglomerate Udenna is partnering in big projects with several other Chinese state firms in energy and construction.

Among those is a U.S.-blacklisted company involved in China's building of a missile-equipped artificial South China Sea island that the Philippines sees as a national security threat. Udenna has acknowledged its Chinese partner's involvement.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines is considering allowing more nurses and other medical professionals to leave for jobs abroad after banning them from travel so they can fight coronavirus at home, President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesman said on Thursday.
Thousands of the nurses, who call themselves ""priso-nurses"" have appealed to the government to be allowed to travel, Reuters reported on Wednesday. The nurses say they feel underpaid, underappreciated and unprotected at home.
Health care workers from the Philippines are on the front lines of the pandemic at hospitals in the United States, Europe and the Middle East as well as back home.
The labour minister has proposed to expand exemptions to those who had contracts abroad as of Aug. 31. So far it is only those with contracts as of March 8 who have been allowed to travel.
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque told a media briefing that a proposal for a relaxation would be made on Monday to President Duterte, who will have the final say.
Foreign Affairs Minister Teodoro Locsin, who has called for the lifting of the ban, said in a tweet the Philippines has 400,000 nursing graduates without jobs so ""they're rightly pissed."" 
In Germany there are 430 doctors and nurses per 10,000 people. In the Philippines, there are 65.
The Philippines has the highest number of recorded coronavirus infections in Southeast Asia with 276,289. Its 4,785 deaths are second only to Indonesia.
Labour Minister Silvestre Bello told nurses on Sept. 11 he was confident the president would support his proposal to relax the travel ban. He said the total lifting of the ban was ""under serious study"". 

""While we don't want our nurses to leave, they are at a disadvantage. They don't have jobs here and even if they did, the salary is low,"" Bello said as he urged nurses to fight for their rights.

ALGIERS (Reuters) - A vote on a new constitution in Algeria in November marks a turning point for a country that has been rocked by huge protests and political upheaval and which is now struggling to move on from the tumult.
For President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, adoption of the charter would be a welcome new beginning after his predecessor and many top officials were toppled by mass demonstrations last year.
For the ""Hirak"" opposition movement, the Nov. 1 referendum will show what clout it still has, after its protests ended the 20-year rule of veteran leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika but failed to achieve its ambitions of deeper change.
The weekly mass protests, which sought to sweep away the entire ruling elite, were put on hold when the coronavirus pandemic reached the north African country in March.
Abdelaziz Djerad, the prime minister appointed by Tebboune in January, recently told parliament the referendum should be a ""day for consensus"" among all Algerians. 
It fits with Tebboune's narrative of the mass demonstrations as a moment of national renewal that ousted corrupt officials and, its ends achieved, is now over. 
""Hirak demands are in the new constitution. It is important to pass it,"" Abdelhamid Si Afif, a senior ruling party member, told Reuters. 
However, though it is now six months since they last paraded through the boulevards of central Algiers, prominent figures in the leaderless opposition do not see it Tebboune's way. 
Their goal was to force from power the entire generation of officials that has ruled since independence in 1963, along with the military and security figures in the background who, they say, pull the strings.
Influential people in the Hirak, such as Islam Benatia, see the constitution as doing little to answer their demands and the referendum as a tactic to sideline their movement. 
""We are in a state of obstruction. There is a lack of consensus over the constitution that will be submitted to referendum without any real debate,"" he said.
The disquiet among Hirak activists was only strengthened on Tuesday when an appeals court confirmed the jailing of journalist Khaled Drareni, only reducing his sentence from three years to two, for his role in the protests. 
Several other prominent Hirak supporters have also been imprisoned. Some in the movement see it as a signal from the authorities that they will not tolerate any resumption of protests.
Internally, Hirak supporters seem unsure whether to push for more street demonstrations or seek other ways of pressing their case.
TURNOUT KEY
Tebboune's proposed constitution gives parliament more rights to open inquiries into government work and limits the president to two terms in office. 
It has passed a vote in parliament despite some opposition. ""We boycotted the vote... because there has been no debate. It is unacceptable to pass it without discussion,"" said Lakhdar Benkhelaf, a leading member of the Front for Justice and Development, an Islamist party. 
Many street protesters regard the constitution as irrelevant in any case - what matters is not so much the laws as they are written, they say, as who enforces them and how. 
It all points to a vote in November much like that which took place in December when Tebboune was elected. The Hirak also opposed that vote, arguing that no election could be fair until the ruling elite was swept from power and the military stepped back from politics. 
However, despite a turnout of only 40% according to official figures, Tebboune won an outright majority, and even before the pandemic shut down the protests, witnesses attending them said that the numbers taking part had started to fall. 
The courts meanwhile jailed a succession of once senior officials on corruption charges, while the ageing head of the military, the bete noire of some protesters, died suddenly of a heart attack. 
It allowed Tebboune to present his administration, though it was rejected by the protesters, as a new broom and the referendum as the next stage in the process of reform. 
""If turnout is high it would give Tebboune the needed political strength to move forward,"" said political analyst Farid Ferrahi. 
On the streets, it is far from clear whether many Algerians will choose to vote. Mohamed Khelafi, a 29-year-old taxi driver who has not worked in months because of the lockdown, said improving living conditions should be the priority. 

""I don't care about politics or voting. I am too busy with how to secure a daily income,"" he said.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Prisoners in a Ugandan jail overpowered their guards and 219 of them escaped with at least 15 guns, but two were killed after security forces launched an operation to recapture them, a military spokeswoman said on Thursday.
The inmates escaped late on Wednesday from a jail in Karamoja, a remote, semi-arid northeastern region, said the spokeswoman, Brigadier Flavia Byekwaso.
Before fleeing, they broke into the prison armoury and stole 15 AK-47 rifles, 20 magazines and other ammunition.
""It's a mass escape ... these were hard-core criminals,"" she said, adding they included murderers, robbers and rapists.
A big security operation was underway to recapture them and two of the inmates had been killed in the pursuit while two were re-arrested, she said.
The fact they had some weapons and a head-start of hours of darkness made the search more difficult, Byekwaso said. 
""They've had a whole night to disperse and hide, it complicates our efforts but we shall get them."" 
It was Uganda's third prisoner escape since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in March as fears of contracting the virus in cramped jails spurred inmates' efforts to break out. 
At least three cases of the coronavirus have been reported in Ugandan jails.
The total number of inmates in Uganda rose 10% to 65,000 in the five months to August, according to the prisons service, a surge attributed to a large number of people apprehended for violations of various anticoronavirus measures like curfews and travel restrictions.
Karamoja, a mountainous area on Uganda's border with Kenya, is also a mineral-rich region where both wildcat and large-scale miners dig for a range of minerals and metals including gold.

Posting such creations on social media brought a new wave of customers to their shop, prompting them to switch the focus of their business to special orders and workshops for wannabe cake illusionists.

The request come after a complaint by a whistleblower nurse alleging that detainees in a Georgia immigration detention facility had improperly received hysterectomies and other gynecological procedures.
The complaint did not specify the nationality of the affected detainees. 
In a separate case, the Mexican ministry said its consulate in El Paso, Texas was in contact with a Mexican woman and her lawyer after an allegation of sexual abuse by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) agents.
It did not give more details. 
In August, ProPublica and The Texas Tribune reported allegations of a guard sexually abusing detainees including a Mexican woman at an El Paso immigration detention center. ICE at the time said the accusations would be investigated.
The ministry said both consulates were seeking clarity from U.S. authorities and trying to identify any affected Mexicans. 
It said Mexico had activated consular protection mechanisms and that consular personnel had increased attention at the detention centers to ensure rights were respected, the ministry said. 
""The government of Mexico will promptly follow up through its various diplomatic and legal instruments to fully understand what happened,"" the ministry said in a statement.
ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The nurse's allegations of improper medical procedures on detainees at the Irwin County Detention Center were filed on Monday to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General by advocacy groups Project South and the Government Accountability Project.
Reuters interviewed Wooten but could not independently confirm the claims of improper hysterectomies, or surgery to remove the uterus.

Taiwan has complained repeatedly about stepped up Chinese military activity in the air and waters near it, in what Taipei sees as part of Beijing's efforts to get them to accept Chinese sovereignty.
Last week, Taiwan said China carried out two days of mass drills off its southwest coast, between mainland Taiwan and the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands, which China called a ""necessary action"" to protect their sovereignty.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said the two Chinese anti-submarine aircraft flew around the same air space to its southwest, and were given verbal warnings over radio to leave.
Taiwan's air force also monitored the two Chinese aircraft, it added in a brief statement.
The announcement comes the same day U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach is due to arrive in Taiwan, in a trip likely to further rile Beijing which regularly denounces United States support for the democratic island.

When U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar visited Taiwan last month, the highest-level U.S. official to come in four decades, Chinese air force jets briefly crossed the mid-line of the Taiwan Strait and were tracked by Taiwanese missiles.

429,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 08:38PM ET</span>",Mountaintop telescopes spared as wildfire smoke from Western U.S. tracked in Europe,"By Deborah Bloom and Brad Brooks
PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - From a mountaintop observatory near Los Angeles to the normally verdant Cascade range in the Pacific Northwest, crews on Wednesday battled monster wildfires that raged well into their second week as scientists tracked the smoke drifting across Europe. 
Scores of fires have burned some 3 million acres in California since mid-August and another 1.6 million in Oregon and Washington state since Labor Day, laying waste to several small towns, destroying thousands of homes and claiming at least 34 lives.
The fires have thrust concerns about climate change to the forefront of the U.S. election campaign, with Republican President Donald Trump downplaying the role played by global warming. Democratic challenger Joe Biden called Trump a ""climate arsonist"" who has ignored a ""central crisis"" facing the nation.
Trump late on Tuesday declared a federal disaster for the hardest-hit parts of Oregon, a state unaccustomed to the size and number of blazes sweeping the Northwest, many sparked by intense lightning storms and stoked by record-breaking heat and high winds.
""You can't fight a 20-foot wall of fire that's multiple miles wide with a couple of fire engines,"" said Shannon Pettner, a battalion chief with Oregon's Sweet Home Fire Department.
With improved weather finally enabling fire crews to take the offensive, Pettner has been helping beat back the state's largest conflagration this season - the 190,000-acre Beachie Creek fire. As a local, she said losses from the blaze struck her on a personal level. 
""Places that we would take our children camping or go and visit, we've seen those altered permanently,"" she told Reuters. ""We won't see those places look the same probably in my lifetime.
Firefighters in Southern California scored a notable victory on Tuesday night, saving the famed Mount Wilson Observatory and its telescopes from being swallowed in the so-called Bobcat fire raging through the rugged peaks of the San Gabriel range above Los Angeles.
""I was telling people yesterday (Tuesday) that the defense of the Mount Wilson Observatory was taking on the feel of a mini-Alamo,"" said John Clearwater, a spokesman for Angeles National Forest, where the blaze erupted on Sept. 6.
Twelve firefighting crews on the ground waged an all-out campaign with water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers loaded with flame retardant, which crept to within 500 feet of the site. Also saved was an adjacent complex of broadcast and emergency communication towers.
But the blaze, still burning mostly uncontained, continued to pose a threat to several nearby foothill communities under evacuation orders.
The West Coast wildfires, which officials and scientists have described as unprecedented in scope and ferocity, have filled the region's skies with smoke and soot, compounding a public health crisis already posed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Smoke levels abated enough on Wednesday that environmental agencies lifted an air quality advisory for coastal Oregon and southeastern Washington.
WHERE THERE'S SMOKE
Scientists tracked the smoke as far away as Europe. The European Union's Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) was monitoring the fires and movement of smoke across the United States and beyond.
""The fact that these fires are emitting so much pollution into the atmosphere that we can still see thick smoke over 8,000 kilometers (4,970 miles) away reflects just how devastating they have been in their magnitude and duration,"" CAMS Senior Scientist Mark Parrington said in a statement.
The simultaneous burning of dozens of fires along the West Coast has stretched the resources of the three states to their limit, particularly in Oregon, where fires rarely impact the normally rainfall-rich Cascade Mountains the way they have this year.
Trump's disaster declaration, requested by Oregon's governor, bolstered federal assistance for the state. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said on Wednesday it had allocated $1.2 million to bring relief to Oregon.
Eight deaths have been confirmed in Oregon, with 12 people reported unaccounted for as search teams continued to scour incinerated towns for the missing. Nearly 4,000 evacuees remained displaced, according to the American Red Cross.
In California, authorities said 17,000 firefighters were still battling 25 major fires on Wednesday, as the state's death toll stood at 25. One fire-related fatality has been confirmed in Washington state.
Nearly 8,000 homes and other structures have been reduced to rubble by fires in all three states.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Syria is experiencing worsening gasoline shortages as a result of tougher U.S. sanctions disrupting crucial fuel imports, its oil minister said on Wednesday, the latest crisis to hit the war-devastated country's crumbling economy.
The Caesar Act - the toughest U.S. sanctions which came into force last June prohibiting foreign companies trading with Damascus - had disrupted several imported shipments from undisclosed suppliers, Bassam Touma told state television.
""The tightening of the American siege and their barring of imports from arriving forced us to reduce distribution of gasoline by 35%,"" Touma said.Residents say there have been acute shortages in the capital and main cities, where long queues have been building at petrol stations in the last week.
The fuel shortages come with the country in the throes of an economic crisis, amid a collapsing currency and inflation sky-rocketing, aggravating hardships for ordinary Syrians battered by years of war.
The government has limited private vehicles to 30 litres of gasoline every four days, with residents saying hundreds of motorists wait for hours before gas stations are opened.
Oil production collapsed after Damascus lost most of its oil producing fields in a stretch east of the Euphrates River in Deir al-Zor.
These oil fields are now in the hands of U.S. backed Syrian Kurds, who continue to sell part of the oil to Damascus.
Syria had previously relied on Iranian oil shipments but tightening sanctions on Iran, Syria and their allies have dried up supplies in the past year.
The shortages were worsened by major maintenance at the Baniyas refinery, the country's largest, which supplied two-thirds of the country's gasoline needs, Touma said.
Touma said once unavoidable maintenance work at the 130,000 barrel per day capacity refinery had been completed in the next 10 days, capacity would rise by 25%. Shipments from several undisclosed sources would also help ease the crisis later this month, he added.
Oil traders say oil imports through Beirut port, a major conduit, have also been disrupted in the wake of a major explosion last August.
Washington has long accused Syria of smuggling oil through Lebanon across a porous border area where Damascus's ally Iranian-backed Hezbollah holds sway. 
A shortfall in foreign currency had also forced Damascus to import less fuel in the last two months, further worsening supplies, two traders said.

Hours earlier, Robert Redfield, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said a COVID-19 vaccine could be broadly rolled out by the middle of next year or a little later.
""No I think he made a mistake when he said that,"" Trump said, telling reporters he called Redfield. ""That's incorrect information. ""I believe he was confused. I think he just misunderstood the question, probably.""
Redfield, head of the federal government's disease control agency, made his comments in testimony before a U.S. Senate panel 
He said general availability of a vaccine could come by ""late second quarter, third quarter 2021."" 
A vaccine could be ready as soon as this November or December, Redfield said, adding that limited first doses could go to those who were most vulnerable. But ""in order to have enough of us immunized to have immunity, I think it’s going to take six to nine months,"" he added.

Malaysian and U.S. authorities estimate $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB in an elaborate scheme that spanned the globe and implicated high-level officials in the fund, former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and others. Najib has denied wrongdoing.
In a complaint filed in the Central District of California on Wednesday, the Justice Department said the $300 million was traceable to a line of credit extended by Venezuela's state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. to Saudi's PetroSaudi Oil Services in connection with an oil drilling venture.  
The companies are already embroiled in a legal dispute over the funds which the Malaysian high court has sought to freeze with cooperation from the British authorities. 
The Justice Department said it was also seeking four dozen promotional movie posters that Riza Aziz, a Hollywood producer and Razak's stepson, acquired with more than $4 million in funds traceable to assets embezzled from 1MDB. 
Prosecutors dropped money-laundering charges against Aziz in May after reaching a deal in which he agreed to help authorities recover 1MBD-related assets. 
Wednesday's complaint brings the total value of assets the United States has sought to recover in relation to the scandal to $2.1 billion - the largest ever asset recovery action brought by the agency. So far the United States has recovered or assisted Malaysia in recovering nearly $1.1 billion in assets.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday forcefully rebuked federal prosecutors for a series of failures, including withholding exculpatory evidence, that led to the dismissal of an indictment against a banker who had been convicted of Iran sanctions violations.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan said prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan repeatedly violated their disclosure obligations and made misleading statements in their case against Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad.
While the office ultimately admitted its mistakes, Nathan faulted its leadership for failing to ""unequivocally condemn"" the ""significant errors"" or ensure the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility would look into the matter, including whether prosecutors acted in bad faith.
A spokesman for Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan declined to comment.
The decision is a black eye for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office, long known for the quality of its lawyers, its independence from Washington, and its prosecution of high-profile cases involving Wall Street and other financial crimes, government corruption and terrorism.
""Those who stand up in court every day on behalf of that office get the benefit of that reputation - but they also have the responsibility to maintain it,"" Nathan wrote.
""The Court commends the USAO's admission of error and effort to do justice in this case by agreeing to dismiss the indictment,"" she added. ""Better late than never.""
Jurors convicted Sadr on March 16, after prosecutors had accused him in 2018 of using foreign companies to funnel $115 million through the U.S. banking system to Iran, in connection with a Venezuelan construction project.
The case disintegrated after prosecutors disclosed their inadequate disclosures to Sadr.
Revelations included an email where a prosecutor suggested the government ""bury"" a key document in a stack of other documents, and the improper use of a state-issued warrant to search for evidence of possible federal crimes.
Nathan dismissed the case on July 16 after Strauss' predecessor Geoffrey Berman wrote ""it would not be in the interests of justice"" to continue prosecuting Sadr.
The judge ordered that prosecutors in Strauss' office read her decision, and called for better training to ensure they understood their disclosure obligations and the limits of search warrants for digital evidence.

In a joint statement, Sadr's lawyers Reid Weingarten (NYSE:WRI) and Brian Heberlig called their client ""an honest businessman and patriotic U.S. immigrant who did not deserve the mistreatment he received from the U.S. government,"" and said Nathan ""correctly called out the prosecutors"" for denying him a fair trial.

Peruvian shamans try to predict U.S. election winner,"LIMA (Reuters) - With incense smoke, flowers and photos of President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden, Peruvian shamans performed an ancestral ritual on Wednesday for the U.S. elections, but there was little agreement about who would win the Nov. 3 ballot.
Chanting and blowing a traditional Andean shell instrument, the shamans, dressed in multicolored garb, invoked the ""Pachamama"", or mother earth, for the U.S. vote to take place in peace, without attacks or any witchcraft between the rivals.
Shaman teacher Ana María Simeón, during the ritual held in a low-lit room of an old building in downtown Lima, said she was in favor of Biden.
""That is why we are cleansing him (...) we have seen that they are attacking him with witchcraft, with a black doll, with a voodoo doll they are shadowing to remove him,"" said the shaman with necklaces wrapped around her neck.
During the ritual, the shamans, dressed in Andean ponchos and cloaks, rubbed medicinal plants, fruits and even a live snake on photos of Democratic candidate Biden and Republican Trump.
According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll on Wednesday, Biden leads Trump nationally among likely U.S. voters by 9 percentage points, with 50% of likely voters planning to cast ballots for Biden while 41% were doing the same for Trump.
""Good energies to Mr. Donald Trump,"" said the master shaman Pablo Torres, carrying the snake on one of his shoulders after squirting a strange liquid from his mouth onto the image of Trump.

""Why? Because he is deserving, he needs good energies, good vibes from his followers,"" he said. ""We are supporters of the gentleman. He will win; he is a winner.""

The move came two days after the New York Times reported that Caputo, a former adviser to President Donald Trump's presidential campaign, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that government scientists were engaging in ""sedition"" in their handling of the pandemic.
Caputo said without evidence that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was harboring a ""resistance unit"" determined to undermine Trump, according to the report. He also said that armed left-wing squads were preparing for insurrection following the election. 
He has since apologized to HHS staff for his behavior, according to multiple media reports https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/michael-caputo-apology-hhs-staff-415206 on Tuesday.
HHS, the cabinet department in charge of combating the coronavirus, said in a statement that Caputo had decided to go on a leave of absence ""to focus on his health and the well-being of his family.""
Caputo said he decided to take the leave to undergo screenings for a ""lymphatic issue"" discovered last week. He said he had experienced unexplained weight loss but did see a doctor. 
""This was a mistake, and contributed to my stress level, along with the increasing number of violent threats leveled at me and my family back in Buffalo,"" Caputo said in a statement. 
Ryan Murphy, the principal deputy assistant secretary for public affairs, will be in charge of Caputo's office during his absence, the agency said. 

Paul Alexander, a senior policy adviser to Caputo, will be leaving the department, HHS said.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's health minister has urged Chileans to celebrate the country's independence day holiday on Friday ""prudently"" amid fears that a special permit allowing people to hold and attend family gatherings could result in a spike in coronavirus cases. 
The day is normally marked by exuberant communal fairs to which Chileans flock in large numbers to watch horseback displays and traditional dancing, while consuming large quantities of barbecued beef, stuffed 'empanada' pastries, and alcohol. 
This year, as Chile seeks to maintain an upper hand over the virus, the authorities have canceled the fairs.
But Chileans can apply for a special 'party at home' permit from police that allows a household to host an additional five people for up to six hours. The permit will only be granted to people in communities out of full lockdown.
Health Minister Enrique Paris said Chileans had earned some enjoyment after months of lockdown but urged them not to throw away the gains against the coronavirus.
On Wednesday, Chile recorded the lowest number of deaths in 90 days. Overall, it has had over 12,000 COVID-19 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.
""Let's be careful and responsible, let's comply with the rules, let's beat the virus,"" said Paris. ""Just as our forefathers won freedom for Chile and gave us that freedom with effort and sacrifice, hopefully our citizens today will also take up that baton.""
Paula Daza, the health ministry undersecretary, stressed people should continue to wear masks and avoid sharing utensils during the festivities.

It had been a mistake for the government not to discuss how to handle the holiday more broadly with its scientific advisory group, said Izkia Siches, the president of Chile's College of Medics. The result might have been more ""cautious,"" she said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - When the coronavirus pandemic hit Argentina, painter Gonzalo Esquivel could not know it marked the beginning of a personal crisis that would eventually see him living on a vacant piece of land with thousands of others evicted from their home. 
With his work disrupted by the virus, Esquivel, 23, was unable to pay his rent. He now lives in a makeshift slum that sprang up when people who lost their homes started to occupy a patch of land near the town of Guernica in Buenos Aires province. 
""I couldn't pay the rent any more and I ended up on the streets,"" Esquivel said. ""I sold my furniture, my TV, my things... I have nowhere to go.""
Argentina, already in recession since 2018, is headed for a steep 12% economic contraction this year. The pandemic has pushed up poverty levels and unemployment, and forced more people from their homes.
In shacks made of sheet metal, plastic, wood and cardboard, thousands of families have settled in the field. Most started arriving in July, while Argentina was still under a strict lockdown that saw most commerce come to a grinding halt. 
""We need a fixed place to support my family, my baby, because I may have one day of work and the next day not,"" said Carolina Rivero, an unemployed mother of a disabled son. 
Argentina's jobless rate was 10.4% in the first quarter, government data show. A projection by consultancy Ecolatina put the figure for the second quarter at 14%, which represents about 400,000 people out of work.
There are about 3.6 million Argentine families impacted by homelessness, according to government data, which has led to a rise in squatting around the country.

In Guernica, officials are seeking to evict the families who occupy the 98-hectare patch of land by the end of September.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The head of the European Commission said on Wednesday the chances of reaching a trade deal with Britain were fading by the day as the British government pushes ahead with moves that would breach their divorce treaty.
The British government announced draft legislation last week which it acknowledges would violate its international legal obligations and undercut parts of the divorce deal it signed before Britain formally left the European Union in January. 
Brussels wants Prime Minister Boris Johnson to scrap what is known as the Internal Market Bill, saying it could sink talks on future trade arrangements before Britain finally leaves the EU's orbit when a status quo transition period ends in December. 
Johnson has refused.
""With every day that passes, the chances of a timely agreement do start to fade,"" said Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, the EU executive. 
In a speech to the European Parliament, she said the divorce agreement ""cannot be unilaterally changed, disregarded or dis-applied"".
""This is a matter of law, trust and good faith ... Trust is the foundation of any strong partnership,"" she said.
The EU fears a disorderly Brexit if the terms of the trade relationship are not agreed, and former British prime ministers have said breaking the law is a step too far that undermines the country's reputation. 
Johnson has said the bill was essential to counter ""absurd"" threats from Brussels including that London be required to put up trade barriers between Britain and its province of Northern Ireland and that the EU would impose a food blockade. Such steps, he said, would threaten the unity of the United Kingdom.
Asked on Wednesday if the EU was negotiating in good faith, Johnson said: ""I don't believe they are."" 
""Perhaps they will prove my suspicions wrong,"" Johnson said.
COMPROMISE WITH REBELS
Johnson's Internal Market Bill has been criticised by senior members of his governing Conservative Party and the previous five prime ministers have also expressed concern at the damage it might do to Britain's international standing.
However, he appeared to have averted a rebellion by Conservative lawmakers which might have derailed it altogether after agreeing to a compromise with them on Wednesday.[L8N2GD4RA]
""It is agreed that the parliamentary procedure suggested by some colleagues provides a clearer, more explicit democratic mandate for the use of these powers, and also provides more legal certainty,"" the government and two of the rebel lawmakers said in a joint statement.
It will mean parliament will have to give its approval before ministers can use the powers which override the Brexit divorce deal. 
Earlier, Britain's Northern Ireland minister Brandon Lewis told parliament he stood by remarks he made last week that the bill would ""break international law in a very specific and limited way"".
However in a sign of continuing unease with the plans, Scotland's top law adviser to the British government, Richard Keen, quit his role, saying he could not reconcile his legal obligations with the government's policy intentions.
His resignation comes after the head of the British government's legal department quit last week over the issue.

EU diplomatic sources told Reuters that if the bill was passed in its current form, Brussels felt it could not deal with London.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Wednesday that talk of possible sanctions over the case of Alexei Navalny was affecting its plans to borrow money on international markets, acknowledging the risk of harmful economic fallout from his poisoning.
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Moscow was waiting for an opportunity to tap the Eurobond market, but would not do so with the threat of sanctions hanging over it.
""All these restrictions, sanctions and hype around Navalny do not give us confidence in a good placement,"" he said.
Moscow is looking for extra sources of funding to make up a budget shortfall caused by lower oil prices and the COVID-19 pandemic, so any delay is potentially problematic. It last raised $2.5 billion in June 2019 through dollar-denominated Eurobonds.
Navalny, the most prominent opponent of President Vladimir Putin, fell violently ill and collapsed last month while travelling from Siberia to Moscow. He was airlifted to a Berlin hospital, where doctors found he had been poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. 
Germany says laboratories in three countries have established the presence of Novichok, and demanded an explanation from Moscow. Russia says it has yet to see evidence.
British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said during a visit to Washington: ""From the UK's point of view, (it's) very difficult to see any plausible alternative explanation to this being carried out by the Russian intelligence services, but certainly the Russian government has a case to answer.""
WHY POISON HIM?
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked about possible repercussions for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline due to bring Russian gas to Germany, said it was wrong to link that to the Navalny case. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has faced calls to halt the project, which is more than 90% complete and scheduled to operate from early 2021.
""This is a commercial project that is absolutely in line with the interests of both Russia and European Union countries, and primarily Germany,"" Peskov said.
Allies of Navalny reacted with scorn to comments by Russia that it would have made no sense for Moscow to poison an opponent whose popularity rating was so low. 
Russia's permanent mission to the European Union said there would be no reason for Russia to poison Navalny with a military-grade nerve agent and then allow him to travel to Germany where the substance could be detected. 
It added: ""What would be the reason for the Russian authorities to poison Alexei Navalny, taking into account that his actual popularity level hardly reaches 2%?""
Navalny's chief of staff Leonid Volkov responded on his Telegram social media channel: ""It's as if they're saying 'If his rating was 20%, then we would have poisoned him.""
Navalny spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said results of regional elections at the weekend, in which candidates backed by Navalny gained seats in two Siberian cities, showed his support among Russians was much higher.
Navalny, who spent several weeks in a coma, on Tuesday shared a photograph showing him sitting up in his Berlin hospital bed, surrounded by his family. He said he could now breathe independently.
Opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov told Reuters he knew from Navalny's team that his recovery would be lengthy.

""Great news that he will be back,"" Gudkov said. ""And Navalny will return to the country as a different Navalny, a world famous politician, and this will help all of us fight this regime.""

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Luis Arce, the candidate for the party of Bolivia's former socialist president Evo Morales, could win next month's election in the first round, with opposition to him fragmented among rival parties, an opinion poll suggested on Wednesday.
The large-scale Jubileo Foundation poll, carried out by universities and media organizations, found 40.3% of Bolivians would vote in the Oct. 18 general election in favor of the Movement towards Socialism (MAS), whose presidential candidate is Arce.
Arce is a former economy minister and Morales loyalist.
Carlos Mesa, a former president, came second in the poll - which discarded undecideds - with 26.2%, while current interim President Jeanine Añez trailed behind with 10.6%.
To avoid a second round, the election winner requires at least 40% of valid votes in the first round and a ten point advantage over its closest competitor.
The survey was conducted between Sept. 3 and 7 among 15,979 people around the country, with a confidence level of 95%, according to the pollsters, an alliance of more than 20 Bolivian organizations.
Last week, a Ciesmori poll suggested MAS would be three percentage points short of a first-round electoral win. 
If the vote were to go to a second round, Mesa could cross the line if he could persuade supporters of the other non-MAS candidates to back him, analysts have said. 
Franklin Pareja, a political scientist at San Andres University, said it was notable how MAS had managed to dodge scandals swirling around its former leader Morales, who is in exile in Argentina, while Mesa had failed to gain traction among voters. 
""The other notable aspect is the significant disappointment for Añez, who despite having projected herself as a great leader, today has absolutely no chance,"" he said. 

MAS spokesman Sebastian Michel said the party was now going after the almost 30% of people the latest poll suggested were undecided. A debate between the presidential candidates is scheduled for Oct. 8.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani ruling party parliamentarian has introduced legislation seeking to jail anyone who ""ridicules or brings into disrepute or defames"" the military, according to records posted on parliament's website on Wednesday.
Civil rights groups and opposition parties have long held that the military meddles in politics and had supported crackdowns on critical voices, an allegation the military denies.
""The purpose of this amendment is to prevent hatred and disrespectful behaviour against the Armed Forces,"" says the bill, presented by Amjad Ali Khan, chairman of parliament's standing committee on defence.
The bill seeks up to two years of imprisonment and a fine of up to 500,000 rupees ($3,012.59).
Information Minister Shibli Faraz did not respond to a request for comment. 
The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has a simple majority in the lower house of parliament but not in the upper house where it cannot pass legislation without opposition support. 
""If the powerful quarters intend to get it passed and make it law, they will do it,"" said opposition senator Pervaiz Rashid of the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz. ""I fear it will be misused.""
One South Asia legal expert, Reema Omer of the International Commission of Jurists, said the move was unnecessary given the constitution already guarantees the armed forces' sanctity.

445,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 03:40PM ET</span>",Eight European countries urge Brazil to take action on Amazon deforestation,"By Jake Spring and Lisandra Paraguassu
BRASILIA (Reuters) - A group of eight European countries urged Brazil to take ""real action"" to combat rising deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest, which is threatening Europe's desire to source food and other products sustainably.
Brazil's Vice President Hamilton Mourao, who leads the Brazilian government's Amazon conservation efforts, on Wednesday responded that the call was part of a European protectionist strategy.
European politicians and investors have mounted pressure on Brazil to step up environmental protection as deforestation rises and the two sides attempt to finalize a free trade deal agreed to in principle last year.
The group of countries called the Amsterdam Declarations Partnership, currently led by Germany, sent an open letter to Mourao late on Tuesday expressing concerns that Brazil is backsliding on its formerly strong record on environmental protection.
""While European efforts are aiming at achieving deforestation-free supply chains, the current trend of rising deforestation in Brazil is making it increasingly difficult for businesses and investors to meet their environmental, social and governance criteria,"" the two-page letter said.
""The countries meeting under the Amsterdam Declarations Partnership would expect a renewed and firm political commitment from the Brazilian government to reduce deforestation being reflected in current and real action.""
Mourao said Brazil's foreign ministry would talk to the German ambassador and organize a broader meeting with representatives of the other countries if necessary.
""This has nothing to do with investors. ... You have to understand this is part of a trade strategy of European countries,"" he told reporters outside his office.
""This is a barrier. There are tariff barriers and non-tariff barriers.""
The Amsterdam Declarations Partnership, which aims to supply Europe with deforestation-free commodities, includes Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. Belgium, which is not a partnership member, also is a party to the letter.
The letter praised Brazil's past actions to preserve the environment, but noted ""deforestation has increased at alarming rates"" recently. The countries said they are ready to intensify dialogue with Brazil on the subject.

HOUSTON/MOBILE, Ala. (Reuters) - For Grant Saltz, who runs a barbecue restaurant in Mobile, Alabama, what struck him about Hurricane Sally was its steady, deliberate pace, after the storm rumbled into the U.S. Gulf Coast on Wednesday as a powerful Category 2 hurricane. 
""It’s so slow, this one,"" said Saltz, 38, while clearing away tree branches during a pause in the rains. ""We had strong winds for a long period of time. Instead of a few hours we got it for 12 hours."" 
Sally is not the most powerful storm to batter the U.S. Gulf Coast in recent memory, but its glacial pace is becoming a regular feature of the deadly storms, which some scientists attribute to climate change. The storm has already dropped more than 18 inches of rain in the last 24 hours, with more rainfall looming, the National Hurricane Center said. 
At one point during its approach, Sally was moving at a mere 2 miles per hour (3.2 kph), recalling Hurricanes Harvey in Houston in 2017, Florence in the Carolinas in 2018, and Dorian in the Bahamas in 2019, massive weather systems that parked over land and dumped rain that had to be measured in feet instead of inches. 
A 2018 study found that tropical cyclone speed has decreased globally by 10% since 1949 as the atmosphere warms, which creates the chance for drenching rain to inundate the coastline, said Jennifer Collins, professor in the school of geosciences at the University of South Florida. 
""These North Atlantic hurricanes are increasingly likely to stall near the coast for many hours,"" Collins said.
The question of whether climate change is causing some storms to slow down before landfall is the topic of ""a lot of papers flying back and forth and discussions and arguments"" among meteorologists, said Phil Klotzbach, atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University.
""The thing that’s more well agreed upon is that the warmer atmosphere is going to bring more rain,"" Klotzbach said. That is what worries scientists given how busy 2020's hurricane season has been. The Atlantic basin has seen eight hurricanes already, a milestone reached at this point just three times in the past - in 1893, 2005 and 2012, Klotzbach said.
There have been 20 named storms this season in the Atlantic basin and the National Hurricane Center is monitoring four now - Sally, Paulette, Teddy and Vicki, with another system in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico possibly becoming a depression in the next several days.
""What is changing is water temperatures are warmer and there are more storms,"" said Jim Foerster, chief meteorologist at DTN, an energy, agriculture and weather data provider.
The popular focus on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which ranks hurricanes on a 1 to 5 rating based on sustained wind speed, ""doesn't take into account the storm surge and the rainfall flooding,"" Collins said, which is usually more deadly than high winds.

Hurricane Harvey overwhelmed the city of Houston with rain for several days, with some areas seeing about five feet in precipitation. It turned highways into tidal rivers as the wettest ever tropical cyclone to hit the United States.

Venezuela's chief prosecutor Tarek Saab on Monday announced charges of terrorism and weapons trafficking against Matthew John Heath, detained last week in the South American country where socialist President Nicolas Maduro is deeply at odds with the United States.
Saab said Heath had been plotting attacks against the OPEC nation's oil industry and electricity system. 
""From everything I've seen, I can say the United States government did not send Mr. Heath to Venezuela,"" Elliott Abrams, the U.S. special envoy on Venezuela and Iran, told reporters when asked about the case.
Abrams said he was limited in what he could say, for privacy reasons, but added that Venezuela ""is particularly difficult because we do not have an embassy with a consular section in Caracas.""
Maduro last week announced Heath's capture, accusing him of spying on refineries in western Falcon state while carrying ""specialized weapons.""
A U.S. government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Monday that Washington was investigating Venezuelan authorities' claims and advised skepticism.
Saab said Heath had entered Venezuela illegally via the Colombian border, was carrying a ""coin"" linking him to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, without providing details, and previously worked for a private military contractor. Pro-government media identified Heath as a former U.S. Marine.
Saab said three Venezuelan citizens were arrested and charged with treason as part of the alleged plot.
Caracas last month sentenced two former U.S. soldiers to 20 years in prison for their role in a botched incursion in May that Venezuelan authorities said was aimed at ousting Maduro.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican-led Senate committee on Wednesday voted to move forward with subpoenas and depositions of dozens of Obama-era officials over the objections of Democrats who say the panel's inquiry is intended to boost President Donald Trump's re-election campaign.
The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee approved moves to subpoena and take depositions from witnesses who the Republican majority say are relevant to its investigation into ""Crossfire Hurricane,"" a code name the FBI used for an investigation it opened during the 2016 election campaign into allegations that Trump's campaign colluded with Russia. 
Trump and his supporters have aggressively denied such collusion and have suggested that the Obama-era inquiries were politically motivated. 
An investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. But Mueller published a report outlining extensive contacts between Trump's campaign and Russian operatives who sought to influence the election.
The committee's Republican majority approved subpoenas and deposition demands for former Obama administration officials including national security adviser Susan Rice, CIA director John Brennan, National Intelligence Director James Clapper and State Department official Jonathan Winer, as well as political supporters Sidney Blumenthal and Cody Shearer. None of these individuals immediately responded to requests for comment.
However, the committee did not vote to move forward with a subpoena for Bridget Brink, the U.S. Ambassador to Slovakia, which a committee source said related to an investigation which Committee Chairman Ron Johnson is conducting into dealings in Ukraine involving Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden's son Hunter. 

During the meeting, Republican committee member Mitt Romney indicated he would vote against a subpoena for Brink, expressing concern the committee's interest in Biden had ""the earmarks of a political exercise"". But Romney did vote to move forward with other subpoenas and depositions.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has opened criminal investigations into 50 pilots and at least five civil aviation officials who allegedly helped them falsify credentials to secure licences, according to two senior government sources and cabinet meeting minutes seen by Reuters.
The probes comes roughly three months after Pakistan grounded dozens of pilots over allegedly dubious qualifications. At the time, the civil aviation regulator said it would conduct a detailed investigation into the scandal.
On the government's orders, Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has launched criminal probes into the matter, according to minutes from Tuesday's cabinet meeting and the sources, who declined to be named because the discussions are private. 
A show-cause notice served to one of the pilots and seen by Reuters said the FIA was investigating ""alleged corruption, violations, malpractices in (the) issuance of flight crew licences.""
Munir Ahmed Shaikh, a senior FIA official, confirmed that a probe into the matter was ongoing, but declined to comment any further. The civil aviation ministry declined to comment until the government makes the matter public.
The ministry submitted the findings of its inquiry to the cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday, said the sources, adding that another 32 pilots have separately been suspended for a year.
""The cabinet was told that FIA has opened proceedings into the pilots whose licences were revoked, and the civil aviation officials who connived with them,"" said the minutes from the meeting seen by Reuters. 
The pilot scandal has tainted Pakistan's aviation industry and especially flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), which has been barred from flying to Europe and the United States after dozens of its pilots were named in the initial list of 262 with allegedly ""dubious"" licenses.
That list had been made public after an initial probe into a PIA plane crash in Karachi in May found that the pilots did not follow standard procedures and disregarded alarms.
The initial list sparked controversy however, as PIA and the local pilot's association noted that many of the pilots named had long since retired and some were even deceased.
Reuters was unable to establish whether the remaining 180 pilots on the initial list were still under investigation or if they had been cleared of any wrongdoing.
A spokesman for PALPA, the local pilots' association, said it had no clarity on the status of the probe. A spokesman for PIA said the airline was awaiting details.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Mali's ruling junta said on Wednesday that it had started the process of naming an interim president, after West African presidents threatened a total embargo on the landlocked country.
Leaders of the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) met on Tuesday with the heads of the junta that overthrew President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita last month to try to speed up the transition back to civilian rule.
West African leaders, nervous the coup could set a dangerous precedent and undermine a fight against Islamist militants across the Sahel region, imposed economic sanctions after the coup, but they appear to have had a limited effect so far.
Speaking to reporters after returning to Mali, junta spokesman Colonel Ismael Wague said ECOWAS leaders had given one week for a civilian interim president and prime minister to be in place.
Wague said the junta told the heads of state it could not give an immediate response. A transitional charter approved at multi-party talks says the interim president can be a soldier or a civilian and will be chosen by electors selected by the junta. 
""We returned around 2 a.m. and already this morning we have started to put in place the electors, which means we are sensitive to ECOWAS's ultimatum,"" said Wague.
""They say they can still toughen (the sanctions), because so far the food, the fuel is going through,"" he said. ""They say they can make a total embargo. Nothing goes in, nothing comes out.""
In a communique after Tuesday's meeting, ECOWAS said it would lift sanctions once civilian leaders were in place and appeared to accept the junta's 18-month timetable for the transition after previously insisting on elections within a year.

A total of four bronzes from the Vijayanagara period, which lasted from the 14th to the 17th century, were stolen in 1978 from a temple dedicated to the god Vishnu in Nagapattinam.
The thieves were convicted in India at the time but it was only in 2019 that three of the statues were found, when the Indian High Commission in London discovered that one of them was being offered for sale by a UK-based dealer.
Alerted by the embassy, the Metropolitan Police's Art and Antiques Unit investigated and was able to establish that the dealer had purchased the item in good faith. 
Once he had been shown evidence that the bronze had been stolen, he voluntarily handed over the sculpture, and identified two additional ones from the same group, the police said. All three will now be returned to their homeland.
The Indian High Commission tweeted photographs of the statues, taken during a formal handover to the government of Tamil Nadu, describing the event as an ""auspicious moment"".
The Metropolitan Police said it was proud to have been involved in the return of the bronzes to India.

""Not only are they beautiful and historically significant, they are of course of religious importance so it's particularly gratifying that they are to be returned to the temple from which they were taken,"" said Detective Chief Inspector Tim Wright in a statement.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has committed systematic human rights violations including killings and torture amounting to crimes against humanity, U.N. investigators said on Wednesday.
Reasonable grounds existed to believe that Maduro and his interior and defence ministers ordered or contributed to the crimes documented in the report in order to silence opposition, they said.
Specifically they had information indicating that Maduro ordered the director of the national intelligence service SEBIN to detain opponents ""without judicial order"", Francisco Cox of the U.N. Fact-Finding Mission told a news briefing.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to a request to comment on the report, which was based on more than 270 interviews with victims, witnesses, former officials and lawyers, and confidential documents.
They included the former head of the National Intelligence Service, General Christopher Figuera, whose testimony was corroborated, the report said.
Most unlawful executions by security forces and state agents have not been prosecuted in Venezuela, where the rule of law and democratic institutions have broken down, the panel said.
The investigators said other national jurisdictions and the International Criminal Court (ICC), which opened a preliminary examination into Venezuela in 2018, should consider prosecutions. 
It would share its database containing the names of officers identified by victims that included 20 officers from SEBIN and 25 from the military intelligence agency DGCIM.
""The Mission found reasonable grounds to believe that Venezuelan authorities and security forces have since 2014 planned and executed serious human rights violations, some of which – including arbitrary killings and the systematic use of torture – amount to crimes against humanity,"" panel chair Marta Valinas said.
The panel found that officers in the military, police and intelligence had committed extrajudicial killings and called on the government to disband the special actions forces of the police known as FAES. 
""PLANTING EVIDENCE""
The panel said it had reasonable grounds to believe the intelligence service falsified or planted evidence on victims, and that its agents tortured detainees. They included opposition lawmaker Fernando Alban, whom the government said committed suicide in 2018 but whose party said was murdered.
Navy Captain Rafael Acosta was believed to have died of torture in the custody of the military intelligence agency DGCIM last year, the U.N. experts said.
The panel, set up by the Human Rights Council to investigate violations since 2014, was not granted access to Venezuela. More than 5 million people - one sixth of the population - have fled the country's political, economic and humanitarian crisis.
Jorge Valero, Venezuela's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told the forum on Tuesday the government was cooperating with the separate office of U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, notably in facilitating prison visits.
Valero denounced the latest sanctions imposed by the Trump administration which were ""causing suffering and death for the Venezuelan people"". The United States, along with dozens of other countries, recognises opposition politician Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate interim leader. 
The report found that the Venezuelan state apparatus responded with repressive tactics to opposition protests that grew especially after Maduro was re-elected in 2018 amid an outcry over the results. 

""Security forces used lethal force against the victim when it was not strictly unavoidable to protect lives. Security forces also used less-lethal weapons in a lethal manner, which resulted in the death of the demonstrators,"" it said.

The striking protest image, an oil painting by Belarusian artist Yana Chernova, takes aim at what rights groups says is systematic violence and torture used by police to try and quell mass anti-government protests. [nL8N2G05LX]
Tens of thousands of Belarusians have taken part in nationwide protests against veteran leader Alexander Lukashenko for more than five weeks. Women have taken a particularly prominent role in the movement. 
""Everything happening with us here is injustified cruelty against people, against girls - it is a mockery of everything that is wonderful, everything that is soft and warm. It is not just against women, but against Belarus,"" Chernova said.
The Interior Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment about torture by police on Wednesday. The government has previously denied accusations of abuses. 
Chernova's painting shows a female figure lying with her arms around the red shape of Belarus against a white backdrop, colours she said she chose to match the red and white flag that protesters have made a symbol of their struggle. 
Chernova, 24, an artist in her final year of art academy in Moscow, said by telephone from Belarus that she has long been critical of the Belarusian government. 
""I was born in this regime, I grew up (in it), I saw and listened to stories of what has happened and continues to happen. It's not news in Belarus that people disappear, are killed and kidnapped,""she said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Wednesday accused Washington of trying to foment a revolution in Belarus, where it sent its defence minister for talks on military ties, in a sign that Moscow's support for embattled Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko was hardening.
Mass protests since an Aug. 9 election marred by vote-rigging allegations have posed the biggest threat yet to Lukashenko, and the Kremlin's backing has become vital for his chances of extending his 26-year rule. 
The former Soviet state farm boss travelled to Russia on Monday for his first talks with President Vladimir Putin since the crisis began, coming away with a $1.5 billion loan to prop up his Soviet-style command economy. 
On Wednesday, Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia's SVR Foreign Intelligence Service, accused Washington of working behind the scenes to overthrow Lukashenko in a coup, some of Moscow's strongest rhetoric over the crisis yet. 
""Essentially we are talking about a poorly disguised attempt to organise another 'colour revolution' and an anti-constitutional coup, the goals and objectives of which have nothing to do with the interests of Belarusian citizens,"" he was quoted by RIA news agency as saying.
He accused Washington of funding anti-government bloggers and training activists through NGOs and of backing others including opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya who fled the country for Lithuania amid a police crackdown.
""According to the SVR's information, the United States is playing a key role in Belarus,"" he said.
Russia has long blamed the West for revolutions such as Georgia's 2003 Rose Revolution, and Ukraine's 2003-04 Orange Revolution, in which Russia said the West backed the protesters.
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu flew into Minsk on Wednesday and held talks with Lukashenko, who said he had asked Putin to supply Belarus with several types of weapon. 
He did not specify which weapons he had requested from Putin and the Kremlin later denied Putin and Lukashenko had discussed supplying Belarus with new arms, the TASS news agency reported.
Russia and Belarus are currently holding joint military drills that run until late September. Lukashenko said the two countries should plan more drills of the same kind.
Moscow is a close ally that sees Belarus as a buffer against NATO and a vital export corridor for its oil. 
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia would provide the first $1 billion tranche of its loan to Belarus by the end of the year and deliver the remainder next year.
The loan, to be denominated in Russian roubles and U.S. dollars, will help Belarus and its state companies honour their debt obligations and support financial stability, Siluanov said. 
Moscow's support for Belarus belies an awkward personal relationship between Putin and Lukashenko, who for years has played Russia off against the West in order to extract political gain from the Kremlin.
Echoing Naryshkin's comments, Lukashenko accused the United States of partnering with Poland, Lithuania, Czech Republic and Ukraine to target his government.

""The tactics of the organisers were based on the classic American textbook of colour revolutions,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach will visit Taiwan for a memorial service for former Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui on Saturday, the U.S. State Department said, a move likely to anger Beijing at a time when U.S.-China ties are at their lowest ebb in decades.
""The United States honors President Lee’s legacy by continuing our strong bonds with Taiwan and its vibrant democracy through shared political and economic values,"" a State Department statement announcing Krach's trip said on Thursday. 
The announcement had been widely expected after the senior U.S. diplomat for East Asia, David Stilwell, said last month that the United States would bolster ties with Taiwan by establishing a new economic dialogue with the island. He said subsequently that Krach would lead it.
The State Department statement made no mention of the dialogue.
On Monday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin was asked about the possibility of a visit by Krach to Taipei and said China firmly opposed official exchanges between the United States and Taiwan, while warning of serious damage to China-U.S. relations.
U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar visited Taiwan last month, the highest level U.S. official to travel to the island since Washington broke off diplomatic ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing in 1979.
Lee Teng-hui, who died on July aged 97, was dubbed “Mr. Democracy” for burying autocratic rule in Taiwan in favor of freewheeling pluralism. He thrived on defying China’s drive to absorb an island it regards as a wayward province.
The United States, like most countries, has official relations with Beijing, not Taiwan, but Washington is bound by law to help Taiwan defend itself and is its main arms supplier.
Reuters reported earlier on Thursday that the United States plans to sell as many as seven major weapons systems, including mines, cruise missiles and drones to Taiwan, as President Donald Trump ramps up pressure on China ahead of his November re-election bid.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Protesters are being tortured in police stations across Belarus, where authorities have failed to open investigations, human rights experts said on Wednesday, holding a press conference in Geneva where alleged victims spoke by video link from Minsk.
The Belarus interior ministry did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. In the past, the Belarusian authorities have said the police are humane and professional, but have declined to comment on specific allegations of abuse which are under review.
Some 7,000 protesters have been detained since President Alexander Lukashenko retained power after a disputed presidential election on Aug. 9, said the Geneva-based World Organization against Torture (OMCT) and Spring, a human rights group based in Minsk.
More than 500 people had provided testimony of torture, which may be ""only the tip of the iceberg"", said Gerald Staberock, OMCT secretary-general.
""The key issue here is that what we have seen after the election unfolding is systematic, planned and intentional torture, used by the State,"" Staberock told Reuters Television.
""We see clear evidence of a planned and organised type of violence, a policy of cruelty, you could call it.""
In an investigation published earlier this month, Reuters interviewed 12 people who said they had been abused in custody. Medical records from six of them showed injuries including external and internal bruising, traumatic brain injury, concussion and a vertebral fracture.
U.N. human rights investigators said on Sept. 1 that they had received reports of hundreds of cases of torture, beatings and mistreatment of anti-government protesters.
Valentin Stefanovich, deputy chair of Spring, speaking from Minsk, said the group had recorded more than 1,000 complaints of abuse by police, none of which had resulted in a case being opened.
Detainees had been ""beaten with batons, maltreated, injured, (causing) bone fractures, wounds and massive bruises, and electrocuted with stun guns and shot with rubber bullets,"" he said. ""The detainees were deprived of sleep, hygiene products, food and water, denied medical assistance and necessary medicines.""
Three alleged victims -- two men and a woman -- addressed the briefing from Minsk via video link, with their faces out of the frame. They said police had beaten and mistreated them in detention centres.
""Frankly speaking I don't remember what I signed because I was under threat of electroshock,"" said one of the men.

Pompeo made the comments in a joint news conference in Washington with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.
Pompeo said last month he had triggered a 30-day process to reimpose all U.N. sanctions on Iran by lodging a complaint with the Security Council accusing Tehran of breaching a 2015 nuclear deal. Pompeo has said sanctions should be reimposed from Sunday. 
But 13 of the 15 council members said the U.S. move is void because Washington quit the nuclear deal two years ago and diplomats say few countries are likely to reimpose U.N. sanctions.
""We will return to the United Nations to reimpose sanctions, so that the arms embargo will become permanent next week,"" Pompeo said. 

""We'll do all the things we need to do to ensure that those sanctions are enforced,"" he added when asked how the United States would achieve that and what it would do to punish countries that do not reimpose the measures.

463,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>","Polish ruling party faces internal struggle over LGBT, women's rights","By Joanna Plucinska
WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki is resisting efforts by ultra-conservatives in the ruling coalition to step up a government crackdown on LGBT and women's rights, wary of further hurting ties with the European Union, government sources say.
The Law and Justice (PiS) government angered Brussels by using language during the campaign for a presidential election in July which critics said fomented homophobia.
That worsened already deep tensions with the European Commission over government policies which the EU executive says subvert democracy, including attempts to curb the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.
With no election due for three years, the coalition wants to use the period to expand its ageing voter base. But, at a time of economic difficulties exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, it is divided over how to do so, senior officials say.
How the debate is resolved will help determine whether the nationalist coalition can avoid more open confrontation with the European Commission, which would risk Poland facing potential penalties. 
PiS' head Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the final arbiter of government policy, says Western values, and specifically ""LGBT ideology"", should be avoided in Poland to preserve its traditional, Christian culture. 
One wing of the coalition wants those beliefs to be defended through more specific actions. More moderate forces want to avoid antagonising Brussels.
Officials close to Morawiecki say Poland should be more pragmatic about relations with its EU partners as it faces pressure and possible loss of funds over its adherence to the rule of law. 
""We don't need another front,"" one coalition official said. 
""CENTRAL EUROPEAN PATH""
At the heart of internal coalition tensions is Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, the architect of government reforms of the judiciary which the EU says politicise courts, the government sources said. 
Ziobro, who heads a small ultra-conservative party allied with PiS, has said gay marriage should be banned outright and that Poland should leave the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention on combating violence against women, the government sources said. 
At Ziobro's request, a Polish town that declared itself free of ""LGBT ideology"", prompting the EU to reject a town-twinning application, received compensation for the loss of EU funds it would have received if the project had gone ahead.
Since an election to the European Parliament in May last year, about 100 Polish municipalities have signed similar declarations. This has fuelled concern in Brussels although they appear not to have been followed by legislation to discriminate against LGBT residents.
For Ziobro, governing based on identity politics is the only way to maintain a steady support base.
An official in Ziobro's United Poland grouping rejected the more liberal path taken by governing parties in Europe such as Germany's Christian Democrat Union which ""has nothing to do with conservatism anymore and is unacceptable"".
""We want to go on our central European path that protects, not only defensively, but offensively builds the strength of the family, strengthens our national traditions,"" said the official on condition of anonymity.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen laid out the risks of such a stance on Wednesday in a speech to the European Parliament.
""LGBTQI-free zones are humanity-free zones. And they have no place in our (European) Union,"" she said, using the abbreviation for LGBT, questioning or intersex people. 
Morawiecki has blocked Ziobro's call to leave the Istanbul Convention, and some officials are reluctant to back other moves that might antagonise Brussels such as limiting foreign ownership in the media sector, the government sources said.
Divisions in the coalition could come more out into the open in the coming weeks, when the government is expected to release details of its new strategy and legislative programme including reducing the number of ministries.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Top Huawei executives had close ties to company at center of U.S. criminal case,"By Steve Stecklow and Marcelo Rochabrun
LONDON/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - An obscure Hong Kong-registered company stands at the center of the U.S. criminal case against China's Huawei Technologies and its chief financial officer.
U.S. authorities allege the giant telecom-gear maker used the firm to skirt American economic sanctions on Iran between 2007 and 2014. Huawei has said it sold the business in 2007 and denies any wrongdoing.
Now, Reuters has uncovered previously unreported links in Brazil between Huawei and the company, Skycom Tech Co Ltd, that could offer support to the U.S. case against the tech giant and Meng Wanzhou, its chief financial officer and daughter of its founder. Corporate records filed with the state of Sao Paulo in Brazil show that Huawei and Skycom were closely intertwined there for five years after Huawei disposed of its shares in Skycom in 2007.
Until late 2007, two other top-level Huawei executives also had close ties with Skycom, corporate records filed in Brazil and Hong Kong show. Both men - Ken Hu and Guo Ping - currently are deputy chairmen of Huawei and serve on a rotating basis as the company's chairman. Guo now has the chairman's role.
The criminal case is part of a multifaceted, global campaign by Washington to check the power of Huawei, a front in America's broadening cold war with China. The United States has been lobbying allies to avoid using Huawei equipment in their next-generation mobile telecommunications systems, known as 5G. Washington argues China could use the technology to attack critical infrastructure and compromise intelligence sharing. Huawei and China have strenuously denied this.
Huawei's relationship with Skycom is central to the high-profile U.S. criminal case. A U.S. indictment alleges Huawei controlled Skycom and used it to violate American sanctions by obtaining embargoed U.S. computer gear in Iran. Huawei and Meng have maintained that while Huawei once owned Skycom, the firm later became in effect an arms-length business partner. In a recent court filing related to the case, however, Meng's lawyers acknowledged that Huawei ""exercised a level of control over Skycom.""
The information newly uncovered by Reuters buttresses the U.S. case by establishing that Huawei's control over Skycom was even stronger than American prosecutors have asserted. Corporate records show that two additional Huawei executives ran a company that owned Skycom - not just Meng, the sole executive named by prosecutors. Records also show that Huawei's control of Skycom extended to Brazil, not only Iran, and lasted through the period of the alleged sanctions violations, long after the Chinese tech giant claims it sold its 100% stake.
Huawei declined to comment for this article.
Until now, only Skycom's business activities in Iran have received public attention. But the company records filed in Sao Paulo show that Skycom also had a little-known presence in Brazil between 2002 and 2012.
The records show that Hu was based in Sao Paulo in May 2002 when Skycom acquired a small stake in Huawei Brazil, where he was then a manager. Hu's LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile states he also was president of Huawei's Latin America region around that time.
Hu later left Brazil, but he established another link to Skycom. Hong Kong company records show that in 2007, Hu and Guo were directors of a Huawei affiliate, Hua Ying Management Co Ltd, that owned Skycom. Hua Ying transferred its shares in Skycom to another company that year. Meng was listed at the time as Hua Ying's corporate secretary.
Documents filed by American authorities in the U.S. criminal case describe the share transfer as essentially a sham transaction and that Huawei continued to control Skycom as ""an unofficial subsidiary.""
Last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce added Huawei and scores of its affiliates, including Hua Ying, to its so-called ""Entity List."" That move restricted sales of U.S. goods and technology to Huawei. Washington said the affiliates ""pose a significant risk of involvement in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.""
Hu, Guo and Meng are currently listed as the three directors of Hua Ying in the Hong Kong companies registry.
Hu, who is also known as Hu Houkun, and Guo aren't named in the U.S. criminal case. Their links to Skycom and its activities in Brazil haven't been reported before.
Huawei's close links to Skycom in Iran after the purported 2007 sale have been previously documented by Reuters. The Brazilian documents, filed with the Sao Paulo companies registry, show the extent to which Huawei and Skycom also continued to be closely linked in Brazil for five more years.
For example, in July 2008, Huawei Brazil's two shareholders at that time – Skycom and a Huawei affiliate called Huawei Tech Investment Co Ltd – each appointed the same Chinese person to represent them at Huawei Brazil. The documents also show that Meng, who was then serving on the boards of both shareholding companies, authorized the appointments.
Indeed, during Skycom's decade as a shareholder of Huawei Brazil until 2012, Skycom was always represented in the Brazilian company by people who were also representing Huawei's interests, the documents show.
'NUMEROUS MISREPRESENTATIONS'
The United States has been trying to get Meng extradited from Canada, where she was arrested at the request of U.S. authorities while changing planes in Vancouver in December 2018.
The U.S. indictment alleges that Huawei and Meng participated in a fraudulent scheme to obtain prohibited U.S. goods and technology for Huawei's Iran-based business via Skycom, and move money out of Iran by deceiving a major bank. U.S. authorities have identified the bank as HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC. Meng is accused of giving a PowerPoint presentation to a HSBC executive in 2013 that included ""numerous misrepresentations regarding Huawei's ownership and control of Skycom.""
A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment.
Huawei and Meng have denied the U.S. criminal charges, which include bank fraud, wire fraud and other allegations. They have argued in court filings in Canada that Meng did not deceive HSBC. Skycom, which was incorporated in Hong Kong in 1998 and dissolved in 2017, is also a defendant.
The U.S. indictment cites Reuters stories in 2012 and 2013 that detailed numerous financial and other ties between Skycom, Huawei and Meng and described an attempt by Skycom in 2010 to obtain embargoed U.S. computer equipment in Iran. The 2013 article directly linked Meng to Skycom. 
In June, Reuters reported that following its 2013 article, Huawei acted to cover up its relationship with Skycom in Iran, according to internal Huawei documents. Huawei declined to comment on the story.
The Brazilian records show Skycom became a small shareholder of Huawei Brazil in 2002 without injecting new money into the company. Instead, Huawei Brazil's two shareholders at the time - both Huawei-affiliated companies - transferred shares to Skycom.
When Skycom exited Huawei Brazil in 2012, it transferred its shares to yet another Huawei entity, Huawei Technologies (Netherlands) BV, the Brazilian filings show.
PUBLIC ROLE
Hong Kong corporate filings show that in 2005, Hu and Guo became directors of Hua Ying, the Huawei affiliate, within days of the unit's incorporation there that year. Hua Ying later played a key role in Huawei's purported sale of Skycom.
Skycom filings in Hong Kong show that Hua Ying acquired all of Skycom's shares in February 2007. Nine months later, Hua Ying transferred the shares to a company called Canicula Holdings Ltd, a holding company registered in Mauritius.
U.S. authorities allege that Huawei never gave up control of Skycom. In court papers filed in Canada, they allege that Huawei treated Canicula as a subsidiary and that Huawei lent Canicula money to buy Skycom. The loan came from another Huawei affiliate, Huawei Tech Investment, they say. Huawei Tech Investment is the company that co-owned Huawei Brazil with Skycom.

Hu and Guo today are among Huawei's highest-level executives. At times, both have played key public roles at the tech giant.
Shortly after Meng's 2018 arrest, Hu held a press conference in China with international media, in part to address U.S. allegations against Huawei. Asked about Huawei's relationship with Skycom, he said he couldn't provide any information because the matter was ""under a judicial process.""

In 2017 the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, which portrays itself as fighting against the remnants of Communism in Poland, introduced a law cutting the pensions of some 39,000 former employees of the secret services.
The measure applied even to people who had worked only briefly during the Communist era, including many who went on to have long careers after the Communists were toppled peacefully in 1989.
For some of those affected, as well as their widows, the decision meant a drastic cut in income. A member of parliament said last year that at least 38 people whose pensions were cut had committed suicide.
The supreme court ruling means that individual challenges brought by thousands of former secret police officers will now be allowed to proceed.
The Onet.pl portal cited the example of a police officer called Piotr Wrobel, who became well known in the 90s for tackling the mafia, but whose pension was cut because he had joined the force before Communism fell.
The Supreme Court said on Wednesday that all circumstances should be looked at when workers' roles in the Communist era, including whether they had infringed human rights.
""There is a man and his deeds behind each case,"" Supreme Court Judge Bohdan Bieniek told journalists.

467,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 12:07PM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. pushes arms sales surge to Taiwan, needling China - sources","By Mike Stone and Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States plans to sell as many as seven major weapons systems, including mines, cruise missiles and drones to Taiwan, four people familiar with the discussions said, as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on China.
Pursuing seven sales at once is a rare departure from years of precedent in which U.S. military sales to the island were spaced out and carefully calibrated to minimize tensions with Beijing.
But the Trump administration has become more aggressive with China in 2020 and the sales would land as relations between Beijing and Washington are at their lowest point in decades over accusations of spying, a lingering trade war and disputes about the spread of the novel coronavirus.
At the same time Taiwan's desire to buy weapons increased after President Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1ZA009 in January and has made strengthening Taiwan's defenses a top priority.
Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue. Beijing says it is a Chinese province, and has denounced the Trump administration's support for the island. 
Washington has been eager to create a military counterbalance to Chinese forces, building on an effort known within the Pentagon as ""Fortress Taiwan"", as Beijing's military makes increasingly aggressive moves in the region.
Taiwan's Defense Ministry said the reported package was a ""media assumption,"" and that it handled weapons purchase talks and assessments in a low-key, confidential way, so could not offer public comment until there was a formal U.S. notification of any sales to Congress.
Taiwan's military is well-trained and well-equipped with mostly U.S.-made hardware, but China has a huge numerical superiority and is adding advanced equipment of its own.
The weapons packages from  Lockheed Martin  Co (N:LMT), Boeing (N:BA) and General Atomics are moving their way through the export process, three people familiar with the status of the deals on Capitol Hill said, and a notification to Congress is expected within weeks.
One industry source said President Donald Trump was slated to be briefed on the packages this week by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Some of the deals had been requested by Taiwan more than a year ago, but are only now being moved through the approval process. A State Department spokesman declined comment.
A senior U.S. official, citing Chinese assertiveness in the Taiwan Strait, said: ""There is no equilibrium today. It is out of balance. And I think that is dangerous.""
Trump's White House has made an https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-weapons/exclusive-trump-to-call-on-pentagon-diplomats-to-play-bigger-arms-sales-role-sources-idUSKBN1EX0WX effort to export weapons to U.S. allies trying to bolster their defenses, decrease dependence on U.S. troops while boosting U.S. companies and jobs.
As he fights for re-election on Nov. 3, Trump and Republican supporters have ramped up their rhetoric against Beijing and sought to portray Democratic opponent Joe Biden as soft on China.
Other factors include Taiwan's bigger defense budget, and the fear in Taiwan that if Trump loses, Biden would be less willing to sell the U.S.'s most advanced weapons to them.
Taiwan's interest in U.S. weapons and equipment is not new. The island is bolstering its defenses in the face of what it sees as increasingly threatening moves by Beijing, such as regular Chinese air force and naval exercises near Taiwan.
The senior U.S. official said Taiwan's increased defense spending was a good step, but it had to do more.
""Taiwan, frankly, needs to do more in order to ensure that they indigenously have an ability to deter Chinese aggression,"" the official said.
DEALS
Drones that can see over the horizon for surveillance and targeting, coupled with advanced missiles and coastal defenses that include smart mines and anti-submarine capabilities to impede a sea invasion, have been discussed at the highest levels to make Taiwan more difficult to attack, like a ""porcupine"", according to industry and congressional sources.
A Lockheed Martin-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), essentially a truck-based rocket launcher, is among the weapons Taiwan wants, people familiar with the negotiations said. Taiwan also seeks to buy sophisticated anti-tank missiles.
In early August, Reuters reported that Washington is negotiating the sale of at least four of its large sophisticated aerial drones to Taiwan for what could be about $600 million.
Also under discussion are land-based Boeing-made Harpoon anti-ship missiles to serve as a coastal defense against cruise missiles.

Other systems include ""underwater sea mines and other capabilities to deter amphibious landing, or immediate attack,"" Taiwan's de facto ambassador https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2FD71A to United States said in July.

468,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 11:51AM ET</span>","EU chief, set to unveil asylum policy, says migration is a fact of life","By Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's chief executive, set to unveil contentious new asylum policies for the bloc next week, described immigration on Wednesday as a normal fact of life and said the continent should learn to manage it.
In a major policy speech to the European Parliament that drew applause and the occasional heckle, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said immigration policy must recognise ""that each human being has a solemn diginity"".
Since 2015, when more than a million people reached Europe by sea and thousands died trying, migration policy has been a source of quarrel within the bloc.
The numbers of those arriving have fallen sharply since then, but EU members are still divided over how to share the responsibility of hosting them, and far right parties have gained votes across the bloc calling for a harder line.
""Migration has always been a fact for Europe – and it will always be,"" von der Leyen said. ""This is normality. We should be and we have to be able to manage that.""
At one point in her speech she was interrupted by a right-wing German lawmaker, as she accused ""the extreme right"" of ""preaching hate"" on the immigration issue. ""But hate has never given any good advice,"" von der Leyen said.
Von der Leyen, whose family has helped a Syrian refugee start a new life in Germany, said some 2 million people come to live in Europe legally each year, while last year just 140,000 people sought asylum.
U.N. data shows 124,000 people made it to the bloc across the Mediterranean last year and 1,319 died at sea, numbers that have fallen each year since 2015.
Southern EU states where migrants arrive, such as Greece, Italy and Malta, have demanded help. Wealthy northern countries where many head after their arrival, such as Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, want an approach that would see asylum seekers distributed across the bloc. But Eastern states led by Poland and Hungary refuse to host any.
OBLIGATORY RELOCATION
Von der Leyen said the new strategy would aim to improve migration management on the bloc's external borders, step up the fight against smugglers and reach more deals with third countries to house migrants in return for EU aid. It would create clear, legal ways to reach Europe, and improve integration programmes.
Sources told Reuters the proposal would still include the most contentious element: obligatory relocation of asylum seekers among all member states at times of immigration spikes.
That means the proposal will face an uphill battle, and months are expected to go by before member states, the Commission and European Parliament reach a deal.

Germany, which now holds the EU's rotating presidency, hopes to have at least a ""political road map"" this year for a future agreement on migration. On Tuesday, Germany said it would take more than 1,500 people stranded on Greek islands after a fire destroyed a migrant camp there last week.

LONDON (Reuters) - Barbados wants to remove Britain's Queen Elizabeth as its head of state and become a republic, the Caribbean island nation's government has said, reviving a plan mooted several times in the past.
A former British colony that gained independence in 1966, Barbados has maintained a formal link with the British monarchy as have some other countries that were once part of the British empire.
""The time has come to fully leave our colonial past behind,"" said Barbados Governor General Sandra Mason, delivering a speech on behalf of the country's Prime Minister Mia Mottley.
""Barbadians want a Barbadian Head of State. This is the ultimate statement of confidence in who we are and what we are capable of achieving. Hence, Barbados will take the next logical step toward full sovereignty and become a Republic by the time we celebrate our 55th Anniversary of Independence.""
That anniversary will come in November of next year.
Buckingham Palace said the issue was a matter for the people of Barbados. Britain's Foreign Office said the decision was one for Barbados to take.
""Barbados and the UK are united in our shared history, culture, language and much more. We have an enduring partnership and will continue to work with them along with all our valued Caribbean partners,"" a Foreign Office spokeswoman said.
As things stand, the governor general of Barbados is appointed by the queen on the advice of the island's prime minister. The governor general represents the queen at formal events such as the state opening of parliament, which was the occasion at which Mason delivered the speech on Tuesday.
Britain has played a key role in the history of Barbados, which was transformed by the Atlantic slave trade. The island was claimed for England in 1625 when Captain Henry Powell landed there.
It was quickly settled and stayed in British hands over the centuries, unlike other Caribbean islands that were fought over by the Spanish, British, Dutch, French and Americans. The introduction of African slaves to work the sugar plantations fields brought fabulous wealth for the white ruling class.
Today's population of under 300,000 is overwhelmingly of African descent. Some cultural links to Britain are still evident: towns have names like Hastings and streets like Liverpool Lane, while the sport of cricket is very popular.

Britain is home to a large community of people of Barbadian descent.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine accused Belarus on Wednesday of trying to escalate a row over 2,000 Hasidic Jewish pilgrims stranded at a border crossing after Ukrainian border guards did not allow them to enter due to coronavirus restrictions. 
Relations between Kyiv and Minsk soured after Ukraine joined the European Union in not recognising the result of last month's election that handed Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko a sixth term in office.
The crisis unfolding in Minsk has pushed Lukashenko back closer to traditional ally Moscow, which remains at loggerheads with Ukraine over Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office accused the Belarusian authorities of ""deliberately or unintentionally"" spreading rumours that the border between Belarus and Ukraine remained open and encouraging the pilgrims heading to Ukraine to try that route.
Every Jewish New Year, tens of thousands of Hasidic Jews make the pilgrimage to the central Ukrainian town of Uman to visit the grave of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, who revived the Hasidic movement and died in 1810. 
This year, Jewish New Year celebrations run from Sept 18-20.
Footage released by the Ukrainian government on Wednesday showed the pilgrims, including children, walking around or standing near a line of helmeted Ukrainian border guards at the Novi Yarylovychi checkpoint. Tents were pitched along the road. 
""We call on the Belarusian authorities to stop creating additional tensions on the border with our country and spreading false and encouraging statements to pilgrims, which may give them the feeling that Ukraine's border may still be open to foreigners,"" Zelenskiy's office said in a statement.
""We are also forced to state that the personal insult of certain persons in the de facto current Belarusian government extends today, unfortunately, to the plane of interstate relations,"" it added, without elaborating. 
Lukashenko on Tuesday offered to create a ""green corridor"" for the pilgrims to travel to Uman on buses and then ferry them back to Belarus, the state news agency Belta quoted his spokeswoman Natalya Eismont as saying.
Eismont could not be reached for comment on Ukraine's statement. 
Ukraine has imposed a temporary ban on foreigners entering the country to tackle a spike in coronavirus deaths, which hit a new record on Wednesday.

It said the ban was partly in response to a plea from Israel, where many of the pilgrims come from, to limit the event, for fear it would be a coronavirus hotspot.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's chief executive said on Wednesday there was no place in the bloc for so-called ""LGBT-free zones"", a pointed criticism of Poland's nationalist government pushing to curb the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.
""LGBTQI-free zones are humanity free zones. And they have no place in our (European) Union,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told her annual policy speech to the European Parliament. 
""Breaches of the rule of law cannot be tolerated,"" she said. 
Last month, Poland's justice minister said a town that had lost EU funding after dubbing itself a zone free of ""LGBT ideology"" would receive government financial support.
Von der Leyen said the bloc's executive will soon present ""a strategy to strengthen LGBTQI rights"" in the bloc, as well as pushing for mutual recognition of family relations in the EU.
""If you are parent in one country, you are parent in every country,"" she said.
Currently, some countries in the bloc recognise same sex marriage and parenthood, but others do not. 
That leads to situations in which, for example, two women recognised as mothers of their children in France would not be treated the same way in Poland, meaning they would not have the same rights depending on where in the EU they are. 
DISCRIMINATION
The Law and Justice (PiS) government in Poland - as well as its eurosceptic ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban - have long been at loggerheads with the EU over undercutting democratic standards. 
While both post-communist states benefit from generous EU handouts, their rulers have come under pressure for putting courts and judges, media and academics, non-government organisations and rights groups under direct government control.
The bloc's 27 EU affairs ministers will discuss the matter again in Brussels next Tuesday, though no decisions are expected and the bloc has so far all but failed to prevent Warsaw or Budapest from backsliding on the rule of law. 
The bloc's one-trillion euro next joint budget for 2021-27, and a linked new economic recovery fund worth a further 750 bilion euros to help repair economic damage done by coronavirus, will make access to EU money conditional on democratic values. 
However, the exact details of any such new scheme are not yet clear, with the European Parliament pushing for tough conditions while Warsaw and Budapest threaten to veto anything that would threaten their benefits. 
The question is set to dominate this autumn's political agenda in the bloc, which needs an agreement on the money-for-democracy mechanism if it is to unlock hundreds of billions worth of spending as sought by those EU countries like Spain and Italy that have been hit hardest by the pandemic.

Von der Leyen also criticised the appearance of anti-Semitic carnival effigies, a regular occurrence in places like Belgium, where the renowned Aalst parade has faced withdrawal from the United Nation's list of recognized cultural events over accusations of racism and anti-Semitism.

474,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 10:16AM ET</span>",Lessons learned from COVID frontline: A Paris hospital refines ICU treatment,"By Noemie Olive
PARIS (Reuters) - Doctor Alexandre Avenel has four COVID-19 patients in his intensive care ward, all with depleted blood oxygenation levels but none under intubation. That might not have been the case six months ago.
As a second wave of coronavirus sweeps across France, and the number of seriously ill patients climbs, intensive care medics say the lessons learned from early in the pandemic are leading to changes in how they treat the sick.
Avenel and his colleagues are delaying mechanical ventilation, a procedure which involves running a tube down a person's windpipe, increasingly placing non-sedated patients on their fronts and reducing the doses used in cortico-therapy.
""Little by little, we learned that we didn't have to intubate all the time, and so now we try to put this off,"" Avenel told Reuters during his shift at a public hospital in Aulnay-sous-Bois, on the northern edge of Paris.
""We needed the experience of the first wave in March and April to realise these people could resist it and that we could hold off (intubating) while they fought it.""
Ventilators are vitally important and have helped save lives. But doctors have highlighted the risks of using invasive, mechanical ventilators too early or too frequently.
Avenel said at the outset of the crisis his team would intubate once a patient's blood oxygen saturation fell to 75-80%, based on experience from other acute respiratory diseases.
Now they understood that the condition of some seriously ill patients would plateau, allowing for other ventilation techniques and therapeutic strategies, including corticosteroids, to be used. These, Avenel said, did not carry the same risk of secondary lung lesions and heart complications as intubation.
""We've had good results,"" Avenel said of placing conscious patients with non-invasive ventilation on their fronts. 
The refined approach reflects a broader shift on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and beyond, as doctors have rethought their use of mechanical ventilators to treat severe sufferers.
In France, the number of COVID-19 sufferers in intensive care has more than doubled to 752 over the past month. In Marseille, epicentre of the second wave, doctors warn their units are close to saturation. 
Avenel's hospital in Seine-Saint-Denis has 18 intensive care beds. Six are dedicated to COVID patients, four are occupied.
Seine-Saint-Denis' blue-collar, racially diverse demographics meant it was one of the hardest hit parts of France during the first wave. The summer lull in cases brought brief respite to Avenel's ward, and with it the danger of complacency.
The ward saw just one staff member test positive during the height of the epidemic in the spring. Last week alone, six tested positive.
Asked about the physical and mental wellbeing of his staff as admissions rise again, Avenel's ward leader Francesco Santoli said: ""We're tired, and a little fatalistic.""

The seven men, who were all members of the wartime crisis headquarters in the town of Sokolac, were arrested there almost exactly 28 years after they allegedly executed 44 Bosniak men from the nearby village of Novoseoci in 1992, and expelled the women and children to Sarajevo. 
The village's mosque was blown up and the debris dumped on the victims' bodies. 
Among those killed were boys and a woman. The remains of all but one victim were uncovered after the war.
The prosecutor will question the suspects and decide on further proceedings, his office said. 
Bosnian Serb forces, helped by the army of the former Yugoslavia, launched military attacks in 1992 on the territories of Bosnia that they had slated for an exclusively Serb statelet, killing and persecuting non-Serbs in an ethnic cleansing campaign.
More than 100,000 people were killed and about two million moved from their homes during the war, which ended with the U.S.-brokered Dayton peace deal in 1995. 
The state prosecutor said two more men were charged over the killings, including Radislav Krstic, a Bosnian Serb general who was jailed over the Srebrenica genocide by the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
Nearly 25 years after the war, there are still more than 600 unresolved war crimes cases involving over 4,500 suspects, a report published by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) showed on Wednesday.
The OSCE has urged Bosnian authorities to overhaul how they process war crimes cases and streamline the work of judiciary.
Bosnia has set a deadline of 2023 for the completion of war crimes cases.

476,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 10:14AM ET</span>","New Japan PM Suga crafts 'continuity cabinet', pledges reform","By Linda Sieg and Sakura Murakami
TOKYO (Reuters) - Yoshihide Suga became Japan's first new prime minister in nearly eight years on Wednesday, pledging to contain COVID-19 and push reforms after retaining about half of predecessor Shinzo Abe's lineup in his cabinet.
Suga, 71, said he would stick with his former boss' ""Abenomics"" growth policies while pushing reforms including deregulation, digitalisation and smashing of bureaucratic barriers.
Seeming to play down the possibility of an early election, he said what Japanese most wanted was to contain the coronavirus outbreak and revive the battered economy. ""This is the first thing I want to work on with my new cabinet,"" he told reporters.
A lower house election must be held by late October 2021 but there is speculation Suga might call a poll sooner to cement his mandate.
Abe, Japan's longest-serving premier, resigned because of ill health after nearly eight years in office.
Suga served under him as chief cabinet secretary, acting as top government spokesman and coordinating policies. He also had the task of defending Abe during cronyism scandals that at times dragged down cabinet support rates.
Suga, who won a ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership race by a landslide on Monday, faces a plethora of challenges from the pandemic to a rapidly-ageing society.
With little diplomatic experience, he must also cope with an intensifying U.S.-China confrontation, build ties with the winner of the Nov. 3 U.S. election and try to keep Japan's own relations with Beijing on track.
About half of the new cabinet are carryovers from Abe. Only two are women and the average age, including Suga, is 60. 
Finance Minister Taro Aso and Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi stayed on, as did Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the youngest in the cabinet at 39. 
""It's a 'Continuity with a capital C' cabinet,"" said Jesper Koll, senior adviser to asset manager WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF).
'ROUGH ROAD AHEAD'?
Yasutoshi Nishimura, Abe's pointman on COVID-19, remains economy minister, while Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kajiyama, the son of a politician whom Suga regarded as a mentor, also retains his post. 
Abe's younger brother Nobuo Kishi was handed the defence portfolio, while former Defence Minister Taro Kono takes charge of administrative reform.
Katsunobu Kato, formerly health minister and a close Suga ally, becomes chief cabinet secretary.
Elected by parliament earlier in the day, Suga received a formal appointment letter in a ceremony with Emperor Naruhito at which both wore face masks because of COVID-19.
Suga, unlike Abe and many other LDP lawmakers, does not hail from a political dynasty. His image has been more that of a backroom fixer than a front-line leader, although his popularity has grown since he decided to run to replace Abe. 
Tomoya Masanao, head of investment firm PIMCO Japan, said Suga's goal of a more digitalised society could widen the gap between rich and poor.
""Abe's administration built political capital for itself with loose monetary and fiscal policies, a balanced and skilful diplomacy with the United States and China, and implementation of flexible domestic politic,"" he said. 
""The new administration, on the other hand, faces a rough road ahead.""
In a move that resonates with voters, Suga has criticised Japan's top three mobile phone carriers, NTT Docomo (OTC:DCMYY) Inc, KDDI (OTC:KDDIF) Corp and SoftBank Corp, signalling he wants more competition and lower rates.
He has said Japan may eventually need to raise its 10% sales tax to pay for social security, but not for the next decade.
Clues as to how Suga may push ahead with reforms could come from the lineup of government advisory panels such as the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, Koll said. 

""The ambition of Mr. Suga to speed up and reinvigorate the process (of reform) is absolutely clear, but the next layer of personnel will be interesting,"" he said.

BEIRUT/PARIS (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday it was not too late for Lebanon's politicians to form a government to save the nation from a crippling economic crisis, after they missed a deadline this week to create a cabinet.
Lebanon is grappling with a financial meltdown and is facing the biggest threat to its stability since a 1975-1990 civil war.
French President Emmanuel Macron has taken a lead role in the international effort to rescue the country from disaster, visiting twice since a massive explosion at Beirut port on Aug. 4 ripped through the city and compounded Lebanon's problems.
But Lebanon's rival sectarian factions failed to deliver on a commitment to Macron to form a cabinet of specialist ministers by Sept. 15 to start reforms demanded by donors to trigger aid flows.
""It is not yet too late. Everyone must assume their responsibilities and finally act in the sole interest of Lebanon,"" a French presidency official told Reuters, saying politicians must back the prime minister-designate's efforts.
Mustapha Adib has been seeking to appoint ministers so they can begin work on a French roadmap. Sources say he has sought to switch control of ministries, many of which have been held by the same factions for years.
But major Shi'ite Muslim and Christian players in the sectarian power-sharing system have complained that Adib, a Sunni Muslim, has not been consulting them.
""It appears that some did not understand or did not want to understand that the French initiative is the last opportunity to save Lebanon and to prevent its disappearance,"" Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon's Druze community, wrote on Twitter.
He echoed comments by French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who said last month that Lebanon could disappear without critical reforms.
Simon Abi Ramia, a lawmaker in the Christian Free Patriotic Movement, said on Twitter that Lebanon faced a critical 24 hours in which either the ""logic of reason"" would win and a government would emerge or Adib would step down.
The French roadmap sets out milestones for a new government, ranging from resuming stalled talks with the International Monetary Fund to fixing the broken electricity system.
But the plan has stumbled at the first hurdle as Lebanon's political elite, who have overseen years of industrial-scale state corruption, have bickered over how the cabinet is formed.
The most significant objections have come from Shi'ite Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah. He has insisted on naming the finance minister, a post he has decided on since 2014. 
Hezbollah, a heavily armed group backed by Iran, supports his position, telling President Michel Aoun on Tuesday that Shi'ite ministers must be approved by Shi'ite parties and that the finance minister should be a Shi'ite, sources say.
Former prime minister Saad al-Hariri, a Sunni whose support was critical to Adib's nomination, said no sect had the exclusive right to the Finance Ministry or other portfolios.

In a tweet, Hariri said rejecting the idea of switching control of ministries was frustrating ""the last chance to save Lebanon and the Lebanese"", referring to the French initiative.

LESBOS (Reuters) - Greek authorities were struggling on Wednesday to move thousands of migrants made homeless by a blaze at an overcrowded camp into new tents, while fears grew over a coronavirus outbreak on the island of Lesbos. 
More than 12,000 people, mostly refugees from Afghanistan, Africa and Syria, were left without shelter, proper sanitation or access to food and water by the fire that tore a week ago through Moria, Greece's biggest migrant camp.
No one was killed or hurt in the fire, which broke out after quarantine measures were imposed following the discovery of COVID-19 cases. The authorities say a new temporary tent camp at Kara Tepe near the island's port of Mytilene is ready to host at least 5,000 people, but so far only 1,200 have moved in.
""They are still reluctant,"" said a police official on condition of anonymity. ""Negotiations are ongoing.""
Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi suggested the authorities would soon run out of patience with those who do not move.
""We will continue for some more days in good faith and communication. After that point, if there are any who react violently, the police will arrest them,"" Mitarachi said.
""We expect that in the coming days we will have completed the transfer of migrants inside the camp. It is nearly double the space of Moria which allows better conditions ... but there will be more security measures,"" he told Skai radio. 
Authorities have distributed flyers and sent text messages to migrants trying to convince them to move. One official said migrants hoped to be allowed to leave the island and believed living conditions in the new camp would be as bad as Moria.
Those entering the new camp were being tested for COVID-19 and so far 35 were found positive. Residents were afraid a coronavirus outbreak was looming with thousands of people sleeping rough and untested.
Four migrants appeared before a prosecutor on Wednesday over the Moria blaze, from among six arrested the previous day.
Another blaze, which broke out overnight near another migrant camp on the island of Samos, was put under control and three people were detained.
Greece's conservative government says it aims to replace open air tented camps with formal migrant centres. New permanent camps will ""offer humane conditions with double fencing, controlled entrance systems, surveillance and fire security systems"", Mitarachi said.
The Moria inferno has put the migrant issue back on the European agenda. European Union Council President Charles Michel visited Lesbos and promised solidarity. Germany said it could take in up to 1,500 people stranded by the fire. 
""European leaders should act quickly to bring the people stranded on Lesbos to safety,"" said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. 

""They also need to fundamentally rethink the failed and inhumane policies that led to the creation of a sprawling, unsanitary and dangerous refugee camp in an EU country, rather than just building a replica of the same thing.""

Speaking to Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu during talks in Minsk, Lukashenko said: ""I also asked the president of Russia for several new types of weapons.""
He did not specify which weapons he had requested from Putin. 
""We can keep the situation under control not only in Belarus, but also along our borders,"" Lukashenko added, according to Belta state news agency. 
Russia and Belarus are currently holding joint military drills that run until late September. Lukashenko said the two countries should plan more drills of the same kind. 
Lukashenko, who has been in power in the ex-Soviet country since 1994, also said that new presidential elections would be held once Belarus adopts a new constitution. 
His comments came two days after Putin hosted Lukashenko for talks in the Black Sea resort of Sochi where the Russian leader bestowed a $1.5 billion loan on Belarus.

480,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>","WikiLeaks' Assange was careful to protect informants, court hears","LONDON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange was careful to ensure that the names of informants in hundreds of thousands of leaked secret U.S. government documents were never published, his London extradition hearing was told on Wednesday.
Australian-born Assange, 49, is fighting against being sent to the United States, where he is charged with conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law over the release of confidential cables by WikiLeaks in 2010-2011.
A lawyer for the United States told the court last week that it was requesting Assange's extradition over the publication of informants' names, and not for handling leaked documents.
John Goetz, an investigative reporter who worked for Germany's Spiegel magazine on the first publication of the documents, said the U.S. State Department had been involved in a conference call suggesting redactions, and WikiLeaks had agreed to hold back about 15,000 documents for publication.
""There was sensitivity and it was one of the things that was talked about all the time,"" Goetz told the court. Assange was concerned that the media should take measures ""so no one would be harmed"", he said.
Goetz said WikiLeaks was later frustrated when a password that allowed access to the full, unredacted material was published in a book by Guardian reporters in February 2011.
Assange made international headlines in 2010 when WikiLeaks published a U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache (NASDAQ:APA) helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff. 
Assange's lawyers argue that he would not receive a fair trial in the United States and that the charges are politically motivated. They have also said he would be a suicide risk if sent to the United States, where they say he could be sentenced to 175 years in prison.
In 2012, Assange took refuge in Ecuador’s London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden where he was accused of sex crimes, which he denied and which were later dropped.

After seven years, he was dragged from the embassy in 2019 and then jailed for skipping bail. He has remained in prison ever since, after the United States made its extradition request.

481,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>",Mass murderer Breivik to apply for parole: report,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik will seek to apply for parole, his lawyer told daily VG on Wednesday. 
The far-right extremist killed eight people with a bomb in Oslo and shot dead 69 others on an island nearby, many of them teenagers attending a Labour Party youth camp in July 2011, in what is Norway's worst peacetime atrocity. 
He is serving Norway's maximum sentence of 21 years, which can be extended indefinitely.
While Breivik is eligible to seek parole after serving the first ten years of his term, a date he will reach in July 2021, it is up to the courts to determine whether a release is appropriate.
""I have at his demand sent a request for parole,"" Breivik's lawyer, Oeystein Storrvik, told VG. 
""This is a right that all prisoners (who can be detained indefinitely) have and that he wants to use,"" he said.
Storrvik was not immediately available for comment.
Reactions to the news were immediate and negative. ""He will never be released. Never!"" tweeted Raymond Johansen, the governing mayor of Oslo, who was secretary-general of the Labour Party at the time of the attacks.
HUMAN RIGHTS
Breivik would also launch a new legal challenge about his prison conditions, Storrvik told VG.
In 2015 Breivik attempted to sue the Norwegian state to end his isolation in prison, arguing that such strict conditions violated his human rights. 
He won the first round in 2016 but lost on appeal. The Norwegian Supreme Court did not take up his case, nor did the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. 
The Nordic country has one of the most liberal regimes in Europe in terms of crime and punishment, with most prisoners released after serving two-thirds of their sentences. 
However, criminals can be detained indefinitely if they are deemed to still pose a threat to society.

""I feel quite safe that the Norwegian judicial system will do the right thing,"" tweeted Vegard Wennesland, a survivor of the attack on Utoeya island.

Unrest since an Aug. 9 election marred by vote-rigging allegations has tested the loyalty of the security forces and their backing has become critical to president Alexander Lukashenko's chances of clinging onto power. 
During regular protests by tens of thousands of people over more than five weeks, some protesters have tried to physically unmask members of the security forces on the streets.
On Wednesday, Andrei Parshin, a senior security official at the Interior Ministry, said 43 criminal cases had been opened against people who he said had threatened police, the Belta state news agency reported.

483,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 07:51AM ET</span>",Pandemic 'hero' Filipino nurses struggle to leave home,"By Karen Lema and Clare Baldwin
MANILA (Reuters) - From across the Philippines, they gathered to pray by Zoom. 
They were praying to be allowed to leave: To be allowed to take up nursing jobs in countries where the coronavirus is killing thousands in hospitals and care homes. In recent months, these care workers have taken to calling themselves ""priso-nurses.""
With infections also surging in the Philippines, the government in April banned healthcare workers from leaving the country. They were needed, it said, to fight the pandemic at home.
But many of the nurses on the two-hour Zoom call on Aug. 20, organised by a union and attended by nearly 200 health workers both in the Philippines and abroad, were unwilling to work at home. They said they felt underpaid, unappreciated and unprotected.
Nurses have been leaving the Philippines for decades, encouraged by the government to join other workers who send back billions of dollars each year.
With COVID-19 sweeping the globalised economy, the Philippine ban squeezed a supply line that has sent hundreds of thousands of staff to hospitals in the United States, the Gulf and Britain, where some commentators have called the nurses ""unsung heroes"" of the pandemic. 
The Philippines' healthcare system is already short-handed. In Germany there are 430 doctors and nurses per 10,000 people, in the United States 337 and in Britain 254, International Labour Organization data shows.
The Philippines - where the coronavirus death rate is one of the highest in Southeast Asia - has 65.
The April ban has stopped more than 1,000 nurses from leaving the country. Of those, only 25 have applied to work in local hospitals, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III told journalists late last month. The Department of Health did not reply to a request for an updated figure.
The government has since partially eased the restrictions, but sometimes also tightens them, so nurses are still clamouring to get out.
On the Zoom call in August, someone played a recording of the Philippine national anthem. A Catholic priest prayed and a man with a soft voice crooned a song about passing off your burdens to God.
One nurse, 34-year-old April Glory, had already spent years away from her young son and had been about to leave again when the ban kicked in. Even before the pandemic, she told Reuters separately, she was better off in a war zone in the Middle East than at home.
Soon after she arrived in Yemen in 2011, a bullet pierced the wall of her private hospital, she said. Staff moved patients to safety.
Still, she said, ""we were insured, we had free lodging so my salary was intact and I could send more to my family."" Abroad, there was no need to do any work outside her job description: ""You are not expected to sweep the floor.""
SIMPLE MATH
It's mainly money that drives the Filipinos abroad.
A nurse in the United States can earn as much as $5,000 per month; in the Middle East it's $2,000 per month, tax free. In Germany, nurses can earn up to $2,800 per month, and get language training, labour organizers, recruiters and the Philippine government's overseas employment agency say.
Even with its emergency hiring efforts, the Philippine Department of Health is only offering nurses a starting salary of $650 per month. It says it will pay another $10 per day as COVID-19 hazard allowance. 
Private nurses sometimes make just $100 per month.
""I felt that I was not earning enough,"" said Glory, explaining why she left. Her son, now 11, was a year and a half old at the time. ""My mother told me: Better to leave now because my child will not really remember.""
Abroad, Glory's shifts were a standard eight hours and she only looked after one or two patients at a time in intensive care. Working in Yemen and then Saudi Arabia, she said she bought a house and a car. 
Nurses have recently left faster than they are trained. Last year, 12,083 new nurses graduated in the Philippines. That same year, 16,711 signed contracts to go abroad, data from the Commission on Higher Education and the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration shows. Those renewing foreign contracts are counted separately. So far this year there have been 46,000 such renewals.
The Philippine government wasn't able to provide figures for the total number of nurses overseas, or say which countries they are working in. 
Filipinos are the biggest group of foreign nurses in the United States. In 2018, there were 348,000, an analysis of U.S. government data by Washington D.C.-based think tank Migration Policy Institute showed. Even with the pandemic, another 3,260 Filipinos have passed the U.S. nurse licensing exam this year.
A report to Britain's House of Commons Library in May said more than 15,000 of the National Health Service nursing jobs held by foreigners went to Filipinos - nearly a third of the total and more than any other nationality. The NHS employs a further 6,600 Filipinos in other healthcare jobs.
Labour brokers say that, besides the UK and US, Filipino nurses are sought-after in Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Singapore.
36-HOUR SHIFTS
Nine months into the pandemic in the Philippines, reported coronavirus infections in the Philippines have soared to around 270,000. Not all hospitals allow family members to visit, so nurses must feed and clean patients as well as giving health care, said Filipino Nurses United President Maristela Abenojar. 
Some nurses are working up to 36-hour shifts because relief staff are calling in sick or not reporting for duty, she said, and sometimes nurses are issued just one set of protective gear per shift. Nurses can't get tested regularly and if they get sick, there aren't always hospital beds reserved for them, she said.
At least 56 healthcare workers have died in the Philippines, Department of Health data shows. 
""It seems they don't really value our contributions,"" said Jordan Jugo, who works at a private hospital in the Philippines. ""It hurts."" He had a contract to work in Britain, but the ban prevented him from leaving.
He said he could sometimes only eat two meals a day and could no longer support his siblings.
The Philippine Department of Health said its healthcare workers work long hours and ""it is natural for them to feel tired and overwhelmed with their immense responsibilities."" It said it had arranged for ""substitution teams"" in some areas. 
It said hospitals should provide sufficient protective gear and that healthcare workers should not go on duty without it. Healthcare workers should be prioritized for regular COVID-19 testing, it said, and the Department would ensure there are enough beds for everyone.
Health Secretary Duque has said previously that the government was appealing to the nurses' ""sense of nation, sense of people and sense of service."" 
""I DON'T WANT TO BE A HERO""
Foreign countries have gone all-out to show Filipino nurses they are valued. 
Saudi Arabia sent chartered planes to help them return to work, and only partly filled them so the nurses could maintain social distance. 
British ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce went on an 11-minute segment on Philippine television to praise the ""incredible commitment and dedication"" of Filipino healthcare workers in Britain. 
When nurse Aileen Amoncio, 36, got trapped by a lockdown and then the travel ban during a vacation to the Philippines in March, Britain's NHS granted her a special ""COVID leave"" and kept paying her, she said. The NHS said staff stuck abroad due to COVID-19 could qualify for such leave.
Amoncio got out of the Philippines in June, after the government eased the ban slightly. 
Working at an NHS neurological rehabilitation hospital in the UK, she said she sympathized with the nurses back home, where she once handled as many as 80 patients on a surgical ward at a small hospital. Now she looks after no more than 10 at a time.
Not only are the pay and conditions better in Britain, she said, but she also hopes her daughter will one day be able to join her and get free treatment on the NHS. The hearing implant she needs would cost $20,000 in the Philippines.
""I've served my country already,"" said Amoncio. ""I don't want to be a hero again. I am looking out for the future of my children."" 
On the Zoom call, Labour Secretary Silvestre Bello III dialed in with an update: Some of those who had existing contracts could leave, he announced. Cheers went up. 
Nurse Glory was one of them. She wept. 
""I hope the government will not take it against us that we are leaving,"" she said. ""We are looking forward to helping the government with this fight in other ways. When we are able, when we've risen out of poverty, we will.""

Hours later, on the pavement outside the airport, she quickly hugged her son, then raced to board her flight in case the government changed its mind.

They are also accused of using far-right chatrooms where extremist content, such as Swastikas and other Nazi symbols, that breaches the German constitution was shared.
The incident is embarrassing for German police and security agencies, who have faced accusations of not doing enough to unearth potentially violent nationalists in their ranks.
It is a sensitive issue in a country where awareness of the World War Two genocide of millions of Jews by the Nazis under Hitler is strong.
""This is a disgrace for the NRW police,"" said NRW Interior Minister Herbert Reul, announcing an investigation against 29 male and female officers.
Some of the suspects could be charged with disseminating Nazi propaganda and hate speech and could be dismissed from the police. Others are accused of failing to report their colleagues.
""I'm appalled and ashamed,"" said Frank Richter, chief of the police force in the city of Essen where most of the suspects worked. ""It is hard to find words.""
German prosecutors said last month they were investigating a retired police officer suspected of sending threatening emails, signed with the name of a gang of neo-Nazi killers, to prominent figures of immigrant background.
The emails, including some sent to legislators with a Turkish background, were signed ""NSU 2.0"", a reference to the ""National Socialist Underground"" neo-Nazi gang, which killed 10 people, mainly immigrants, between 2000 and 2007.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian and Chinese border troops had an exchange of gunfire last week just days before a meeting of their foreign ministers, Indian officials said on Wednesday, in a further breach of a decades-old restraint at the frontier.
The two sides have had a long-standing agreement for troops not to use firearms at the poorly defined Line of Actual Control or the informal border and for 45 years no shot has been fired.
But since late last month, there have been three incidents of warning shots fired in the western Himalayas where troops are locked in a faceoff over competing territorial claims, often in close proximity, officials aware of the situation told Reuters.
""In all these cases shots were fired in the air and not at each other thankfully,"" said one of the officials. 
One of them occurred on the north bank of the bitterly contested Pangong Tso lake in the run-up to a meeting between Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow last Thursday. 
The shooting which neither side has made public was the most intense, a second official said. The official said he was not in a position to provide more details but the Indian Express newspaper said 100-200 rounds were fired.
The two sides are jockeying for advantageous positions on the undemarcated mountain border in the Ladakh sector which adjoins Tibet. Last Monday, troops had fired in the air on the southern bank of the lake, the two sides said.
Jaishankar and Wang agreed to dial down tensions and since then the situation has calmed, the Indian officials said. But there is no pulling back of troops yet.
Former Indian military commander lieutenant general D. S. Hooda said distrust was so large now it would be difficult to get back to the agreement under which troops carried few firearms at the contested border during their patrols.

""We should no longer be talking about peace and tranquillity along the LAC, but conflict prevention,"" he said.

KIGALI (Reuters) - Paul Rusesabagina, portrayed as a hero in a Hollywood movie about Rwanda's 1994 genocide, may face 25 years to life in prison if convicted of various offences, the prosecution said.
Rusesabagina, who once called for armed resistance to the government in a YouTube video, was charged in a Kigali court on Monday with 13 counts including terrorism, complicity in murder and forming or joining an irregular armed group.
""For some of the crimes, he may face 25 years, and some even go up to life imprisonment,"" Faustin Nkusi, spokesman of Rwanda's prosecution authority, told Reuters on phone.
Rusesabagina declined to respond to all the charges on Monday, saying he wanted to take a plea to each individual count. The court will rule on bail on Thursday.
His case has thrust a spotlight on to President Paul Kagame's government, which stands accused by rights groups of stifling dissent. 
Nkusi rejected the criticism, saying the prosecution will guarantee that he gets a fair trial.
""This is not a political case... you cannot exercise your freedom of expression and political rights by killing people, by looting their property, by taking hostages,"" he said.
Rusesabagina's family has called for an international trial. They have also accused the government of denying him the legal representation of his choice.
Nkusi said Rusesabagina had chosen the two lawyers who represented him in court on Monday, adding that he is allowed to talk to his wife and children, who live in the United States.
His family has also accused the Rwandan government of kidnapping him from Dubai, where he was on a trip, a claim that officials in Kigali also reject. 
""He was arrested on the soil of Rwanda, at Kigali International Airport. That's the only information I can give. I don't know how he came but he got found on the territory of Rwanda and then he got arrested,"" Nkusi said.
The Oscar-nominated film ""Hotel Rwanda"" portrayed Rusesabagina, a former hotel manager, using his connections with the Hutu elite to protect Tutsis fleeing the slaughter.
Some in Rwanda, including Kagame, have accused Rusesabagina of exaggerating his heroism, which he denies.

After the genocide, Rusesabagina acquired Belgian citizenship and became a resident of the United States. He became a vocal critic of Kagame, whom he accused of stifling opposition, an accusation the government denies.

487,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 07:21AM ET</span>","As some U.S. college students party, others blow the whistle","By Jan Wolfe and Daphne Psaledakis
(Reuters) - Some U.S. college students are doing the once-improbable: blowing the whistle on classmates who break rules aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus. 
At the University of Missouri, one senior is posting photos and videos on a ""University of Misery"" Twitter account that shows students gathered in large groups at pools, outside bars and other places - few of them wearing masks. 
The university has a form on its website where violations of the school's COVID-19 guidelines can be anonymously reported, but posting on Twitter ""adds a different level of accountability,"" said the student.
""When it's up there publicly and people are retweeting it, and the university's getting tagged over and over - then they have to reply,"" said the student, who sometimes posts videos and photos of non-compliance sent by other students and asked for anonymity to avoid backlash.
Christian Basi, spokesman for the University of Missouri, which has about 30,000 students, said there has been good compliance on campus during daytime hours but problems arise once students leave campus.
""Where we're seeing our issues have been off campus, when individuals go home to their private residences,"" Basi said.
The University of Missouri on Tuesday said in a statement that it had expelled two students and suspended three following ""flagrant violations"" of the school's coronavirus-related rules.
The county where the school is located saw a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in August and early September, according to data on the city of Columbia's website.
To avoid shaming individuals, the student who runs the University of Misery account has sent content that shows smaller groups of people violating COVID-19 guidelines to the vice chancellor for student affairs rather than posting it online.
Still, the student has faced pushback from other students.
In one instance, the student said they heard from a sorority within an hour of posting a video of some of its members lined up outside of a bar, many of them not wearing masks.
""'This needs to be deleted now. We're dealing with this internally. This does not need to be up online,'"" the student said the message read.
'LUDICROUS' EXPECTATIONS
Some schools like the University of Miami are actually paying students to enforce COVID-19 rules. 
At Miami, 75 ""public health ambassadors"" are making $10 an hour to walk around campus and make sure that people wear masks and socially distance. Serious infractions can be flagged to university administrators.
Austin Pert, an ambassador and Miami senior, said that people generally comply with his requests. But Pert acknowledged the program has limitations: most violations do not take place during the day on university grounds.
""If people want to flout the rules and put social distancing aside for a night to go party, it's not happening on campus,"" Pert said.
Critics say having in-person learning during a pandemic was a mistake to begin with.
""The notion that this population will comply with social distancing and masking requirements is just ludicrous,"" said Ryan Craig, a higher education investor and consultant. ""These are college students. They are going to do what they want to do.""
At Northeastern University in Boston, administrators came across an Instagram poll last month in which more than 100 incoming freshman indicated that they planned to party. After the student running the account voluntarily turned over the identities of respondents, they received a letter warning that partying could result in punishment up to expulsion, a university spokeswoman said.
Nearby Boston University has received about 125 anonymous tips about violations, ranging from partying to breaking quarantine. Most have come from students rather than faculty and staff, Dean of Students Kenneth Elmore said.
Ed Kellerman, a BU senior, said he would not hesitate to anonymously report a party, calling it a matter of ""life or death"" for Boston residents near campus.
Kellerman said reporting parties also increases the odds of completing the academic year on campus.

""We're all very pro-snitch right now,"" Kellerman said. ""No one wants to get sent home.""

In tears during an online news conference, family members urged authorities to resume a massive search effort, after Japan's coastguard suspended its rescue last week.
Of the ship's 43 crew, three were rescued - all Filipinos - but one later died after being found unconscious. Thirty-six Filipinos, two New Zealanders and two Australians are missing.
""We are getting frustrated not knowing where they are,"" said Liberty Seneres, wife of chief engineer, Aristotle Sabillena. 
""We are worried. But there still is hope that they are still alive.""
The group called on the Philippine government to resume the search and expand it to waters off South Korea, Taiwan and China. 
They urged the manpower agency that supplied the crew, LMA Korpil, to send resources for a rescue mission and the ship's owner, the United Arab Emirates-based Gulf Navigation Holding PJSC, to start private operations or deploy professional divers.
Gulf Livestock 1, which left Napier Port bound for China carrying nearly 6,000 cattle, sank on Sept. 2 after Typhoon Maysak struck at sea.
""We also believe there are some survivors - if not all - either on those rafts or nearby uninhabited islands just waiting for someone to care enough to keep searching. But we must act now,"" said Fredelyn Addug-Sanchez, sister of ship captain Dante Addug.
She said for those unable to escape, recovery of their remains would at least provide some closure. 
""Let's work together and bring our boys home, they are worth our effort,"" she said.
The Philippine foreign ministry, Korpil and Gulf Navigation did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

FLAGSTAFF, Arizona (Reuters) - Near the end, Howard Smith spent every moment he could with his wife of 50 years as she lay dying from complications of Alzheimer's disease in an upstate New York nursing home.
For 12 days last month, Howard and the couple's daughter, Laurel Smith, kept vigil at Lois Kittson's bedside at the New Paltz Center in the Hudson (NYSE:HUD) River Valley, sometimes spending fitful nights slouched on a chair in her room.
During the first of these visits, Lois, 78, was cognizant, opening her eyes, acknowledging their presence, even smiling though she could no longer speak. When Lois' organs began failing and she could no longer swallow, Howard wet her tongue with cool water every so often to keep her comfortable. A renowned artist, he painted watercolors by her bedside.
There was music, too, meant to soothe Lois through her final days. The visitors often played two CDs: flute sonatas by Bach, which they thought might evoke memories of Laurel's own beautiful playing back in her youth; and violin pieces by Beethoven, including ""Spring Sonata,"" one of Lois' favorites.
Howard was there, holding Lois' hand, when her breathing speeded up on the morning of August 28 and when, hours later, it stopped.
He commended the facility's staff for providing his wife with stellar care but said that being unable to visit her had been wrenching.
""For months we hadn't been able to see Lois except through a digital screen, which really meant very little to her,"" Howard said. ""So these final visits, while sad, were quite beautiful.""
Reuters first wrote about Howard and Lois in April. Their story showed how the pandemic, and resulting nursing home lockdowns, had broken their years-long routine of near-daily visits together, a ritual that was central to the couple's lives. Lois had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's a decade ago and spent the last five years at the nursing home with advancing disability and dementia.
Between March 11 and last month, Howard had rarely been allowed to see his wife in person, including a brief outdoor visit in June.
More than six months into a pandemic that has claimed more than 190,000 American lives, much of the country has now reopened for business. Precautions such as social distancing and mask-wearing remain, but for most Americans, strict lockdowns are over.
At many nursing homes, however, lockdowns remain in force. The final days that Lois, Howard and Laurel spent together highlight how, in facilities that have been the site of more than 40% of the country's COVID-19 deaths, routines are still anything but normal. In many cases, loved ones are still kept out unless a resident is near death.
Visitation bans are meant to protect vulnerable residents against the virus. In New York alone, there have been more than 6,000 COVID-19 deaths at the state's care homes. Health data shows a decline in virus cases at the facilities in recent months.
To be with Lois during her final days, Howard and Laurel Smith were required to make use of one of the only in-person visitation options currently available at Lois' nursing home, the so-called ""end of life"" provision.
Reopening nursing homes to regular family visits is proving a slow and complicated process nationwide. ""It's not just 'open the door and let 'em back in,'"" said Dee Pekruhn, a policy director at LeadingAge, a group that represents nonprofit senior service providers. ""Closing down was the easy part, and opening up is the hard part.""
On August 17, Howard got a call from Lois' nursing home informing him that she had entered the end-of-life phase. This meant family members were allowed to visit and say goodbye.
Howard rushed to her bedside the same day. Laurel, who works in the tech sector and lives in Manhattan, arrived soon after.
""We know she died peacefully, and I don't think my dad would ever have recovered had he not been able to get in there,"" Laurel said.

Six days a week for the past five years, Howard visited Lois to keep her alive. For 12 days last month, he visited Lois to help her die.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Wednesday paid tribute to an Italian priest killed by an immigrant suffering from mental illness, while far-right politician Matteo Salvini called for a ""vendetta"".
Father Roberto Malgesini, 51, who cared for immigrants and other needy people in the northern city of Como, was found dead from a stab wound outside his residence on Tuesday morning.
A Tunisian immigrant who police said was mentally ill later turned himself in to authorities.
Speaking at the end of his weekly general audience, Francis said Malgesini was killed ""by a needy person who he himself was helping, a person who was mentally ill"".
Francis praised the ""martyrdom of this witness of charity toward the most poor (and) all the priests, nuns, laymen and lay women who work with needy people who are discarded by society"".
He then asked the audience of about 500 people in a Vatican courtyard to observe a minute of silent prayer for Malgesini.
Salvini, leader of the anti-immigrant League party and a former justice minister who has sparred with the pope on immigration issues before, mentioned the priest at a political rally in northern Italy on Wednesday morning.
""The fact that yesterday morning in Como a pastor was stabbed by an immigrant who should have been expelled is something that ought to make everyone cry out for vendetta,"" he said at the rally, according to the Italian news agency Ansa.

Nicola Frantoianni of the Italian Left party attacked Salvini, accusing him of ""squalidly"" exploiting the priest's killing to ""inject new poison in the veins of Italian society"".

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in has told Japan’s new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, that he was willing to sit down anytime in a bid to improve ties strained by historical and economic disputes, Moon's office said on Wednesday.
Disputes dating from the neighbouring nation's colonial occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945 deepened over a 2018 order by South Korea’s Supreme Court for a Japanese steelmaker to pay compensation for forced labour during World War Two.
In a move widely seen as retaliation for the ruling, Japan last year said it would stop preferential treatment for shipments to South Korea of some key high-tech materials whose production it dominates and which are used by firms such as Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co.
In a letter to Suga, Moon said Japan shared fundamental values and strategic interests with South Korea, and was its closest friend geographically and culturally, said Kang Min-seok, a spokesman of the presidential Blue House.
""Our government plans to cooperate actively with the Suga administration to wisely overcome issues of past history and reinforce practical cooperation,"" Kang told a briefing.
These included economic concerns and people-to-people exchanges, he added.

Kang said Moon also sent a letter to Suga's predecessor, Shinzo Abe, wishing him a rapid recovery following his resignation because of ill-health.

493,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Pivotal Harvard race discrimination case to be weighed by U.S. appeals court,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday will consider whether Harvard University discriminates against Asian-American applicants in a closely-watched case that could impact whether U.S. colleges can use race as a factor in admissions.
The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston will hear arguments in a lawsuit brought by Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), a non-profit founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, and backed by the Trump administration.
The group sued Harvard in 2014, claiming it illegally engages in ""racial balancing"" that artificially limits the number of Asian-American students at the Ivy League school. Harvard denies the allegation and says it is legally promoting student body diversity in keeping with Supreme Court precedent.
Conservatives have long criticized affirmative action. The U.S. Justice Department under Republican President Donald Trump has backed SFFA, arguing in a ""friend of the court"" brief that Harvard ""actively engages in racial balancing that Supreme Court precedent flatly forbids.""
U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs last year ruled that while Harvard's admissions program is ""not perfect,"" it had no ""workable and available race-neutral alternatives"" to ensure a diverse student body.
She cited decades of U.S. Supreme Court rulings that allow universities to consider race as one factor to remedy disadvantages minority students have faced because of racial prejudice.
The Justice Department has opened a related investigation into Harvard. In August, the department threatened to sue Yale University with allegations it discriminated against Asian-American and white applicants through race-based admissions. Yale denies the charge.
Blum said he is prepared if necessary to appeal to the Supreme Court, whose makeup has changed since it last reviewed the issue.
Deborah Archer, a New York University law professor, said it was unlikely any of the high court's five-member conservative majority would join liberal justices to protect affirmative action.

""Their records before joining the court raise doubt that any would,"" she said.

494,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 06:21AM ET</span>","Behind $12 million Breonna Taylor settlement, 'Black America's attorney general' Benjamin Crump","By Makini Brice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tamika Palmer's voice broke as she spoke about the city of Louisville, Kentucky's $12 million settlement and planned reforms after the killing of her daughter, Breonna Taylor, during a botched police raid.
""As significant as today is, it's only the beginning of getting full justice for Breonna,"" Palmer said during a news conference on Tuesday. ""It's time to move forward with the criminal charges because she deserves that and much more.""
Standing right behind her was Benjamin Crump, an attorney nicknamed ""Black America's attorney general"" by civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton. Crump, 50, has represented the distraught families of a lengthy list of slain African-Americans in recent years, as they have faced some of the darkest moments of their lives in the public glare. 
They include the families of Trayvon Martin, a Black teen shot dead in Florida; Ahmaud Arbery, a Black jogger killed in Georgia; and George Floyd, a Black man whose death in police custody in Minnesota sparked global protests this year. 
Crump says one of his main roles is to keep the spotlight of media attention on the victims and their families. 
""It's no guarantee that you will get to the court of law, but you first have to win in the court of public opinion if you're a minority in America who was killed by the police,"" Crump said in an interview with Reuters earlier this month.
By focusing public attention on his clients, Crump is following in the footsteps of decades of civil rights lawyers, but with new tools like social media and smartphone videos at his disposal, civil rights experts say. 
""He's effective in getting attention paid to his cases and putting pressure on local authorities to act in the interest of his clients,"" said Kenneth Mack, a professor at Harvard Law School. ""And to some extent, that's more than half the job at this moment."" 
Like many plaintiffs' lawyers in the United States, Crump works on a contingency basis and receives a cut of the final settlement. Crump's payments have not been made public but plaintiffs' attorneys frequently receive around a third of the settlement amount.
SUMMER OF PROTEST
Accountability is rare for U.S. police and the localities that employ them when officers use excessive force or kill, in part because of a Supreme Court-protected doctrine of 'qualified immunity,' a Reuters investigation found https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-police-immunity-scotus this year. 
High-profile cases https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-immunity-outliers/when-cops-kill-redress-is-rare-except-in-famous-cases-idUSKBN22K193 that garner national attention are the exception, Reuters found - they can result in hefty civil settlements, if not criminal prosecutions.
Taylor, 26, an emergency medical technician, was killed in her home in March in a storm of gunfire by police officers who entered her apartment with a 'no-knock' warrant. 
Crump took her case on two months later. He ""started calling everyone I know,"" he said on Tuesday. Taylor's family appeared at news conferences and on morning news programs. 
Her name, like George Floyd's, became a touchstone during a summer of protest and demands for racial justice in the United States. Rallies were organized in her honor, and members of Congress introduced a bill banning no-knock warrants. Her portrait featured on the cover of Vanity Fair, and tennis player Naomi Osaka wore a face mask bearing Taylor's name at the U.S. Open.
""It is not just the historic $12 million settlement,"" Crump told reporters on Tuesday. ""This is about setting a precedent... Breonna Taylor's life wouldn't be swept under the rug, like so many other Black women in America, who have been killed by police, marginalized.""
The Kentucky attorney general is expected to announce within days if the police officers involved with her death will be charged. 
SCHOOL INSPIRATION
Crump, 50, was raised by his great-grandmother and mother, who worked at a shoe factory and a hotel in Lumberton, North Carolina. 
He wanted to be a lawyer since the fourth grade, he told Reuters, when his schools integrated, and he attended what had previously been a school for white students. 
""They had better schools, newer facilities, newer books, newer technology,"" he recalled.
His mother told him he was able to attend the school because of the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case, Brown v. Board of Education, which barred legal segregation in public schools.
In college, Crump was a two-term president of the Black Student Union, recalled Sean Pittman, a fellow lawyer and a longtime friend.

""When I see Ben Crump out doing what he's doing right now, being the champion for all these families who have endured this level of injustice, I see him doing the same thing that he's done since he was 18 years old and probably before,"" Pittman said.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The splitting headaches began when smoke from wildfires rolled in around Tim Hunt's suburban Seattle home. Next came a debilitating fatigue. 
As deadly wildfires rage across the U.S. West, Hunt and others are struggling with some of the world's worst air pollution.
""I get out of bed to eat and drink water, and go back to bed,"" said the 64-year-old retired software engineer, who suffered lung damage in 2017 from a bad case of the flu. ""It’s like there’s not enough oxygen in the air.""
Enormous plumes of ash and smoke have spread from the region, where nearly 5 million acres were ablaze on Tuesday, compounding the public health crisis of the coronavirus pandemic. 
In California, levels of lung-polluting particulate matter have jumped far beyond the summertime norm, bathing skies in eerie tones of orange and sepia. 
Hospitals in hard-hit Oregon report a 10% increase in emergency room visits for breathing problems. Doctors are being inundated with calls from worried patients. 
""It's really putting a burden on our asthmatic patients,"" said Dr. Paul Williams (NYSE:WMB), an allergy and immunology specialist in Everett, Washington. ""They're calling us more often and they're requiring additional medications.""
Air pollution, in the case of wildfire measured by the amount of fine particulate matter swirling in the air, is considered a serious health hazard linked to diseases including asthma, lung cancer, heart disease and early death. 
Pollution has hit historic levels in five Oregon cities - Portland, Eugene, Bend, Medford and Klamath Falls, the state said Tuesday. 
""I can't see out my window past two cars,"" said Dr. Gopal Allada, a pulmonologist who teaches at Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine. Allada's office is swamped with calls from patients experiencing breathing problems and asking for advice on what to do about symptoms that include coughing, wheezing, throat irritation, headache and racing heartbeat.
""We're just trying to field the calls,"" Allada said. ""I would have loved to have had more people answering phones.""
In Washington where Hunt lives, the air quality on Tuesday ranged from unhealthy to hazardous at every site monitored by the state.
Residents were stuffing towels in door cracks or sleeping in face masks to cope. 
Particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, known as PM2.5, is the key measure for harmful air pollution. The particles are smaller than the width of a human hair, small enough to burrow deep into a person's lungs and even find its way into the bloodstream. 
Wildfire smoke mostly carries particulates from burning trees and plants, which are already harmful. 
But smoke from devastated communities can also contain toxic chemicals from burned plastic and other manmade materials in cars and buildings such as asbestos, synthetic rubber compounds and heavy metals. These can then pollute not only air but nearby waterways or soils. 
A Reuters analysis of California air quality data showed moderate to hazardous air quality on Sunday and Monday at all but about 20 of more than 120 sites monitored by environmental officials, even as some smoke started to abate. About 40 sites, including San Luis Obispo along the Pacific Coast and large swaths of the agricultural Central Valley and Sierra Nevada foothills, had higher levels of pollutants than usual for six days running, state data showed.
In San Francisco, an area usually spared poor air because of its proximity to the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean, levels of PM2.5 pollution have been three times California's standard limit of 35 micrograms per cubic meter for at least six days. 
""I can't recall a time when we've had this amount of smoke for this long a time,"" said Sylvia Vanderspek, chief of the Air Quality Planning Branch of the California Air Resources Board.
COMPOUNDING COVID-19
The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is also complicating efforts to help people at risk for lung and breathing problems, said Dr. Afif El-Hasan, a pediatrician in Southern California who volunteers with the American Lung Association.
Wildfire pollution can make people more susceptible to COVID-19, he said, and the best masks for filtering smoke are the same N-95 face coverings desperately needed by doctors and nurses treating COVID patients, making medical professionals hesitant to recommend that patients buy them.
It has also been difficult to help people find respite from the bad air, other than to recommend staying home and indoors. 

""Normally when we give air quality alerts we say where people can go,"" said Dylan Darling, a spokesman for the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. ""Often the Oregon coast can provide refuge or the mountains. But right now there is not a place that’s good to go for fresh air.""

BROOKDALE, Calif. (Reuters) - Sandra Stone's family has been coming for years to the cabin along Clear Creek in Brookdale (NYSE:BKD), California, that her great-grandparents built in 1907 using redwood for beams and cut glass crystal for windows.
It is now a pile of rubble after the CZU Lightning Complex fire swept through San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties in mid-August, killing one person, burning 86,509 acres and destroying nearly 1,500 structures.
""It made a lot of ash,"" Stone said on Tuesday during her first visit to the cabin since it was destroyed.
The blaze was one of three massive wildfires in northern California ignited after about 14,000 lightning strikes during a freakishly intense storm, and one of dozens across the Pacific Northwest that have scorched more than 4.5 million acres (1.8 million hectares) since then.
Burning through towns in Oregon and devouring forests in California, Washington and Idaho, the fires have thrown up a blanket of ash and smoke that has made the region's air quality among the worst in the world. The fires have also thrust climate change to the forefront as an issue in the U.S. presidential election.
WATCHED SURVEILLANCE VIDEO
Stone watched from her home in Santa Rosa, a 2 1/2-hour drive away, on surveillance cameras as firefighters drove down the skinny single-lane road trying to save buildings.
""We would go from thinking it was gone for sure to being hopeful that it was still here,"" Stone said as she walked past a creek filled with charred debris, twisted bed frames and a clawfoot tub turned upside down with one of its feet missing. 
It took about two weeks for Stone to prepare for seeing the cabin in person. 
""My reaction actually started further down the road with the rest of the residences that were no longer, and it made me really sad because I can picture them here and now I can picture them gone,"" Stone said.
She said her daughters want to rebuild, but she has no idea how long that would take. Behind the house, loose dirt and downed trees cover a steep incline, raising concerns of erosion.

""Everything that's important is still here,"" she said, sounding hopeful. ""The trees are still here. The creek is still here. And it'll be beautiful again in no time.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU's chief executive chided European Union governments on Wednesday for an ineffective foreign policy and proposed U.S.-style sanctions on human rights abusers around the world.
Once able to boast of a soft power that helped transform communist neighbours into market economies, the EU increasingly finds itself unable to agree common positions to influence international diplomacy on issues ranging from Venezuela to Mali.
""Why are even simple statements on EU values delayed, watered down or held hostage for other motives?"" European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said in her 'State of the Union' speech. 
""When member states say Europe is too slow, I say to them 'be courageous and finally move to qualified majority voting',"" she said. More qualified majority voting would allow the EU to act on more issues without the increasingly onerous process of securing unanimity among the EU's 27 states.
Von der Leyen said her EU executive would come forward with a proposal to freeze assets of those deemed responsible for human rights abuses, similar to the Magnitsky Act of 2012 in the United States. 
Sergei Magnitsky was a Russian lawyer arrested in 2008 after alleging that Russian officials were involved in large-scale tax fraud. Magnitsky died in a Moscow prison in 2009 after complaining of mistreatment.
A new sanctions regime would allow the EU to impose sanctions more quickly on specific individuals anywhere in the world, freezing their assets in the bloc and banning them from entry.
Von der Leyen accused Russia of systematically seeking to eliminate pro-democracy opponents at home and around the region. She said it was wrong to think that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between German and Russia would help to improve tense EU-Russia ties.
She also said nothing could justify Turkey's intimidation of Greece and Cyprus in the Eastern Mediterranean in a dispute over energy resources.

""Turkey is and will always be an important neighbour. But while we are close together on the map, the distance between us appears to be growing,"" Von der Leyen told the European Parliament.

The operation marks a fresh wave in a four-year-old crackdown targeting the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. He denies involvement in the July 2016 putsch, in which some 250 people were killed.
The Istanbul state prosecutor's office issued detention warrants for 132 suspects, 82 of them serving military personnel and the rest retired or expelled from the armed forces, Anadolu said. So far 106 people have been arrested in raids by counter-terrorism police across 34 provinces, it said. 
On Tuesday, prosecutors in the western province of Izmir ordered the arrest of 66 suspects, including 48 serving military personnel, in an investigation of the armed forces.
Since the coup attempt, about 80,000 people have been held pending trial and some 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others sacked or suspended. More than 20,000 people had been expelled from the Turkish military alone.
Ankara prosecutors on Friday ordered the detention of dozens of lawyers suspected of operating in support of Gulen.

Turkish and international lawyers' groups said the lawyers were simply doing their job representing clients accused of Gulen links.

On Tuesday Turkey extended the operations of its Yavuz energy drill ship in disputed Mediterranean waters off Cyprus until Oct. 12, in a move that could stir tension between the island's Greek Cypriot government and Ankara.

503,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 04:27AM ET</span>",Europe Pitches Massive Economic Overhaul With New Climate Goal,"(Bloomberg) --The European Union’s executive proposed toughening the bloc’s emissions targets in a move that’ll force industry to face stricter pollution standards and aims to spur a green economic recovery.
The 27-nation bloc should tighten its emission-reduction target to at least 55% by 2030, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told members of the European Parliament in a key policy speech on Wednesday. The current goal, agreed just six years ago, is a cut of 40% from 1990 levels.
“I recognize that this increase from 40% to 55% is too much for some, and not enough for others,” von der Leyen said. “But our impact assessment clearly shows that our economy and industry can manage this.”
Von der Leyen is aiming to refocus the bloc on its long-term goals after the executive was blindsided by the coronavirus during her first months in charge. The pandemic has handed the 61-year-old German a chance to accelerate her plans to make her European Green Deal the engine of economic recovery as governments mobilize unprecedented amounts of public money for the rebuilding effort.
Under the new climate target for 2030, European automakers would need to adopt tougher pollution standards with new rules that could see combustion engines phased out completely. Energy will grow increasingly cleaner, with an additional 350 billion euros ($415 billion) per year required for investment in production and infrastructure, according to a draft document seen by Bloomberg News.
A more ambitious climate target for 2030 is likely to garner broad support from national governments and the European Parliament.
If approved by national governments and the EU Parliament, the new goal will require buildings to become more energy-efficient and companies will face more strict pollution caps in the EU’s Carbon market, the world’s biggest.
The proposal is an addition to a key climate law that will be the legal foundation of the European Green Deal, a sweeping strategy for Europe to zero-out greenhouse gases by 2050.

The Israeli military said it launched about 10 air strikes in Hamas Islamist-run Gaza early on Wednesday and that 15 rockets had been fired from the territory at Israeli communities near the border, where sirens sounded before dawn.
On Tuesday, a rocket from Gaza struck the coastal Israeli city of Ashdod, wounding two people, at the same time as Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed agreements at the White House to establish diplomatic relations.
""I'm not surprised that the Palestinian terrorists fired at Israel precisely during this historic ceremony,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said before his flight returning to Israel.

No casualties were reported on either side of the Israel-Gaza frontier. The military said eight of the rockets launched on Wednesday were intercepted by its Iron Dome anti-missile system.
In a statement, the military said targets in Gaza included a weapons and explosives manufacturing factory and a compound used by Hamas for training and rocket experiments.

Without naming specific factions, the Islamic Jihad group in Gaza said that in response to the air strikes, the ""resistance"" fired rocket salvoes at Israel.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia has formally named China in a court document as the foreign state under investigation by police in the nation's first foreign interference investigation.
A document lodged in the High Court on September 1 by the Australian Government Solicitor is the first official acknowledgement that the ongoing investigation into an alleged plot to influence an Australian politician centred on China.
The Australian Federal Police and the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation have refused to comment on whether a raid on the offices of a New South Wales state politician and his staffer on June 26 was related to China, although it was widely believed to be.
The court filing states the search warrant used by police ""expressly identifies the foreign principal as the“Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC)"".""
John Zhang，who worked for NSW Labor politician Shaoquett Moselmane, has asked the High Court to quash the search warrants used to search his home, business and Moselmane's parliament office.
The government's defence document, signed off by Australia's Solicitor-General Stephen Donaghue, was lodged with the court the day after the government warned Australian journalists working in China to leave for safety reasons.
In the government's response on September 1, the government solicitor states there is ""no doubt that the suspected offences related to the plaintiff's dealings with the Hon Shaoquett Moselmane MLC, allegedly on behalf of the People's Republic of China (PRC), from about 1 July 2019 to about 25 June 2020, in order to advance the interests and policy goals of the PRC"".
The Chinese government has said ASIO also searched four Chinese journalists in Australia in June.
Australia's foreign interference law criminalised harmful or covert conduct by foreign principals who seek to interfere in the country's democratic processes to support their own intelligence activities or prejudice Australia's national security, the court document said. 
On Wednesday, the Chinese consulate general in Sydney responded angrily to an Australian Broadcasting Corp report that said one of its officials was also named in the search warrants. 
""The accusations that the Consulate General and its official engaged in infiltration activities are totally baseless and nothing but vicious slanders,"" the statement said.

An AFP spokeswoman said ""the investigation remains ongoing"".

More than 730,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh that year following the launch of a sweeping security campaign that refugees said included mass killing, gang-rape and arson. 
The army has denied genocide, saying it was carrying out a legitimate operation against Rohingya militants, but says it has court-martialed some troops over incidents in certain villages though details on the perpetrators, their crimes, and sentences have not been released.
The military, in a statement carried in state media on Tuesday, acknowledged for the first time a possible broader pattern of abuses.
It said the military-run Office of the Judge Advocate General had reviewed a report by a government-backed commission that accused soldiers of committing war crimes and had expanded the scope of its investigations in response.
The office was ""investigating possible wider patterns of violations in the region of northern Rakhine in 2016-2017"", the military said in the statement.
""Allegations regarding villages in the Maungdaw area are included in the scope of this wider investigation,"" the military said, referring to a district on the border with Bangladesh that was a focus of its security operations in 2017.
It provided no more details and an army spokesman did not answer telephone calls by Reuters seeking further comment.

The announcement follows reports last week that two Myanmar soldiers have been taken to the Hague to appear as witnesses or face trial after confessing to killing dozens of villagers in the north of Rakhine State and burying them in mass graves.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 01:01AM ET</span>",Thousands of Oregon evacuees shelter from wildfires as U.S. disaster declared,"By Deborah Bloom and Brad Brooks
PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - Thousands of evacuees displaced by deadly wildfires in Oregon settled into a second week of life in shelters and car camping on Tuesday as fire crews battled on, and search teams scoured the ruins of incinerated homes for the missing.
With state resources stretched to their limit, President Donald Trump approved a request from Oregon's governor for a federal disaster declaration, bolstering U.S. government assistance for emergency response and relief efforts.
Dozens of fires have charred some 4.5 million acres (1.8 million hectares) of tinder-dry brush, grass and woodlands in Oregon, California and Washington state since August, ravaging several small towns, destroying thousands of homes and killing at least 34 people. 
Eight deaths have been confirmed during the past week in Oregon, which became the latest and most concentrated hot spot in a larger summer outbreak of fires across the entire western United States. The Pacific Northwest was hardest hit.
The conflagrations, which officials and scientists have described as unprecedented in scope and ferocity, have also filled the region's skies with smoke and soot, compounding a public health crisis already posed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Satellite images showed high-altitude plumes of smoke from the fires drifting as far east as New York City and Washington, D.C., carried aloft by the jet stream.
The fires roared to life in California in mid-August, and erupted across Oregon and Washington around Labor Day last week, many of them sparked by catastrophic lightning storms and stoked by record-breaking heat waves and bouts of howling winds.
Weather conditions improved early this week, enabling firefighters to begin to make headway in efforts to contain and tamp down the blazes.
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) said 16,600 firefighters were still battling 25 major fires on Tuesday, after achieving full containment around the perimeter of other large blazes.
Firefighters in the San Gabriel Mountains just north of Los Angeles waged an all-out campaign to save the famed Mount Wilson Observatory and an adjacent complex of broadcast transmission towers from flames that crept to within 500 feet of the site.
RECORD ACREAGE LOST
At least 25 people have perished in California wildfires over the past four weeks, while more than 4,200 homes and other buildings have gone up in smoke, CalFire reported. Nearly 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) in California alone have burned - more than in any single year in its history - and five of the 20 largest wildfires on record in the state have occurred during that time-frame.
One wildfire fatality has been confirmed in Washington state, where some 400 structures have been lost. Roughly 1 million acres (400,000 hectares) have been blackened in Oregon, double the state's annual average over the past decade. 
At the height of the crisis there, some 500,000 residents - at least 10% of the state's population - were under some form of evacuation alert, many forced to flee their homes as swiftly advancing flames closed in on their neighborhoods. More than 1,700 structures, most of them dwellings, have been incinerated
At last count, some 16 people reported missing remained unaccounted for in Oregon, emergency management officials said. Last week, authorities said they were bracing for possible mass casualties as search teams began combing wreckage of homes destroyed during chaotic evacuations.
In the fire-stricken southwestern Oregon town of Phoenix, uprooted families, many with young children, were sleeping in their cars, huddling at a civic center or in churches, City Council member Sarah Westover said.
""It's much more difficult to follow the COVID restrictions given the environment,"" Westover said.
Marcus Welch, a food service director and youth soccer coach in Phoenix, said he was helping a group of high school students whose homes were spared to run a donation center set up to assist evacuees from a mobile-home park reduced to ash. 
""Every day, I hear a sad story. Every day, I hear a family displaced. People are crying because high school kids are giving them food, water. ... It's been a total blessing,"" Welch said. ""Some people, they lost everything, so we encourage them to take everything they can.""
Westover said her community was in grief, while fearing a flareup might force them to flee again. Her house in Phoenix was spared, but others nearby were leveled.
""It's like it cherry-picked - it burned down a house, then skipped two, then burned down another. I guess that's the way they kind of work with the embers flying around,"" Westover said.
Rhonda and Chuck Johnston, of Gates, Oregon, described celebrating their 32nd wedding anniversary outside their RV playing card games and eating barbecued chicken in the parking lot of a fairgrounds after a hasty evacuation.

""This is something you never think you're going to go through,"" Rhonda Johnston said. ""We grabbed a couple days' worth of clothes, pills, and two cars full of pictures and two dogs and a cat and our daughter.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Long-simmering tensions between the United States and China have hit boiling point at the United Nations over the coronavirus pandemic, spotlighting Beijing's bid for greater multilateral influence in a challenge to Washington's traditional leadership.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has accelerated his U.N. power play as President Donald Trump's disregard for international cooperation led to the United States quitting global deals on climate and Iran and leaving the U.N. Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization, diplomats say.
""There's definitely, in my mind, a battle for the soul of the U.N. going on,"" said a senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding that Trump's ""America First"" policy has been ""damaging because the Chinese have a sort of smooth assertion that they are the true multilateralists.""
While Trump has made China one of his punching bags as he bids for re-election on Nov. 3, the diplomatic hostilities have spilled over in public meetings of the 193-member General Assembly and the 15-member Security Council. 
Xi had been expected to make a rare visit to New York next week for the annual U.N. gathering of world leaders, which could have provided an opportunity for a meeting in person with Trump. But he will now send a video statement because of the pandemic.
Trump blames China for a lack of transparency about the novel coronavirus, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year. China has rejected his accusations.
'DANGEROUS DIRECTION'
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2660G4 told Reuters on Monday: ""We are moving in a very dangerous direction."" 
He said there was a risk of a rupture between the world's two biggest economic powers that could essentially result in two global economies, which would ""have dramatic impacts, especially for developing countries that will be in the middle.""
Guterres warned that ""a rupture can then lead ... to forms of military confrontation that would be very undesirable."" 
The U.S. and Chinese missions did not respond to repeated requests for interviews.
The tension between the United Nations' two biggest financial contributors is front of mind for many diplomats at the world body. 
""It's something now that you think about almost every other day - how these two superpowers will look at a certain issue ... how U.S., China relations evolve in the coming period and how that spills over,"" said a senior Gulf diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
It took months for the Security Council to adopt a resolution on the coronavirus as the United States opposed any mention of the WHO and on Friday Washington and its ally Israel were the only two countries to vote 'no' on a General Assembly pandemic resolution that was adopted with overwhelming support.
A more assertive China has been putting forward more candidates for senior U.N. positions and pushing for language associated with Xi's Communist Party ideology to be included in U.N. resolutions, diplomats said.
'GAME DOES NOT STOP'
Some diplomats admit Western countries have been slow to respond, but are now pushing back. 
In a declaration to mark the 75th anniversary of the United Nations - agreed by the General Assembly in July and to be adopted by world leaders on Monday - the United States, Britain, Japan, India, Canada and Australia objected to the phrase ""our vision for a common future"" because they said it was Xi rhetoric, diplomats said. The language was removed. 
The United States announced in January that it had assigned a top State Department official with countering ""malign influences"" of China and others at the United Nations. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft said last week that a priority was to get more Americans or people from like-minded countries working in the U.N. system. 
Former U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman, who stepped down in 2018, said Washington now needs to compete for influence ""rather than assume automatic U.N. deference.""

""The U.N. can be characterized as 'home turf' for the United States, but walking off the field will facilitate China moving in to fill the vacuum,"" Feltman wrote for the Brookings Institution. ""The game does not stop when we stomp off the field.""

China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own, has stepped up military activities near the island, in what Taiwan views as intimidation to force it to accept Chinese rule.
Taiwan's denounced the two days of exercises last week, which it said took place in Taiwan's air defence identification zone, between mainland Taiwan and the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands. Taiwan says China sent advanced Su-30 and J-10 fighters to participate.
Offering China's first public explanation for the exercises, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwan was a ""sacred"" and inseparable part of China. 
""The relevant combat training activities by the People's Liberation Army were a necessary action aimed at the current security situation in the Taiwan Strait and to safeguard national sovereignty,"" Ma told a news conference.
In an apparent reference to the United States, Taiwan's main arms supplier and strongest international supporter, Ma said the drills were also aimed at ""the interference of foreign forces"" and Taiwan independence activities, not Taiwan's people.
Taiwan's government was allowing anti-China, Western forces to ""play the Taiwan card"" and become a pawn in stopping China's development, stirring up enmity between the two sides of the strait and seeking Taiwan's independence, Ma said.
""They continue to provoke and are threat-makers and trouble-makers,"" he said.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who has warned of the risk of accidental conflict because of the increasing military activities, says the island is already an independent country called the Republic of China, Taiwan's formal name.
The Pentagon also expressed concern about China's drills last week. The United States has been carrying out its own military activity near Taiwan, including regular warship sailings through the Taiwan Strait.

LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials said on Tuesday a federal watchdog would investigate complaints made by a whistleblower nurse in a Georgia immigration detention facility who alleged detainees had improperly received hysterectomies and other gynecological procedures.
The allegations were made by Dawn Wooten, a former nurse at the Irwin County Detention Center (ICDC), in a complaint filed to the watchdog, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General, on Monday by advocacy groups Project South and the Government Accountability Project.
Reuters interviewed Wooten but could not independently confirm the claims of improper hysterectomies, or surgery to remove the uterus.
The allegations caused an outcry among Democratic lawmakers including U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) denied the allegations. Dr. Ada Rivera, the medical director of the ICE Health Service Corps, said in a statement that since 2018, only two individuals at the Irwin center in Georgia were referred for hysterectomies based on recommendations by specialists that ""were reviewed by the facility clinical authority and approved."" 
LaSalle Corrections, the private contractor that runs the facility, said in a statement that it ""strongly refutes these allegations and any implications of misconduct"" at the Irwin center.
Wooten told Reuters on Monday that women who complained of heavy periods or asked for birth control would be sent to outside gynecologists and sometimes receive hysterectomies but that many did not fully understand what medical procedures were being ordered.
""A lot of them said that they didn't understand what was being done to them. Nobody explained it to them,"" she said.
Attorneys representing detainees at Irwin told Reuters several women had complained about gynecological treatment by an outside provider to the facility.
Sarah Owings, a Georgia-based immigration attorney, told Reuters she and other advocates were collecting information about hysterectomies performed on detainees, and had put out a call to attorneys to review their files. She had no evidence to suggest these surgeries were widespread, she said.
""I do think there's a situation in which healthcare is not up to par in these places and that there is absolutely room to have lack of oversight,"" she said. 
Elizabeth Matherne, another immigration attorney in Georgia, recalled complaining to detention center officials about treatment her clients said they were receiving from an outside gynecologist.

ICE said in its statement ""a medical procedure like a hysterectomy would never be performed against a detainee's will.""

517,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 09:16PM ET</span>",Louisville to pay $12 million settlement over Breonna Taylor's death in botched police raid,"By Maria Caspani and Jonathan Allen
(Reuters) - The city of Louisville, Kentucky, will pay $12 million to the family of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman shot dead by police in a botched raid on her apartment in March, to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit, Mayor Greg Fischer said on Tuesday.
The settlement appears to be one of the largest of its kind in the United States, where police departments are often shielded from having to pay damages for deaths in their custody. 
It does not explicitly admit wrongdoing on the city's part, but it will be accompanied by reforms of the Louisville Metro Police Department, including a requirement that commanders approve search warrants before they are put to a judge, Fischer said at a news conference.
No police officer has been criminally charged over Taylor's death, but the Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Black Republican, is expected to bring the case before a grand jury this week, according to local media reports.
""I'm deeply, deeply sorry for Breonna's death,"" Fischer, who is white, told reporters. ""My administration is not waiting to move ahead with needed reforms to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again.""
Taylor's death, alongside that of George Floyd, a Black man killed in May by a white Minneapolis police officer who knelt on his neck, gave rise to one of the largest protest movements in U.S. history, with daily demonstrations in cities ever since.
The mayor was joined by Taylor's family and local activists, who said they welcomed the settlement but also demanded the officers involved face criminal charges.
""As significant as today is, it is only the beginning of getting full justice for Breonna,"" said Tamika Palmer, Taylor's mother, her voice at times shaking with emotion. ""It's time to move forward with the criminal charges because she deserves that and much more.""
The mayor invited Tamika Mallory, the co-founder of activist group Until Freedom, to the podium, where she said there would be ""no peace"" if the officers involved were not charged.
""A settlement is restitution, but it's not arresting the cops,"" she said. 
The settlement appeared to be one of the largest ever after a police killing in the United States, Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the family, told reporters.
The family of Philando Castile, a Black motorist shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop in Minnesota, was awarded $3 million in 2017; in 2016, Cleveland officials agreed to pay a $6 million settlement to Tamir Rice's family after he was shot dead by a police officer.
As part of Tuesday's settlement, Fischer said Louisville police officers will be offered housing credits to move to some of the poorest parts of the city in the hopes of improving community ties. They will also be encouraged to regularly volunteer for community organizations and will face increased random testing for drug use.
Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was killed on March 13 when Louisville police forced their way into her apartment shortly after midnight using a so-called 'no-knock' arrest warrant that did not require them to announce themselves.
Louisville police obtained the warrant from a judge as part of an investigation into a drug ring at another house elsewhere in the city. They told the judge that they believed that one of the men suspected of selling drugs had used Taylor's apartment to receive packages.
Taylor had previously dated the suspected drug seller but had severed ties with him, according to her family. 
In June, the police department fired one of the three officers involved, detective Brett Hankison, who is white, for displaying ""extreme indifference to the value of human life"" when he fired ten bullets into Taylor's apartment.
The two other officers have been reassigned to administrative duties. The city also banned the use of no-knock warrants.
Fischer declined to agree to the family's request that he commit to firing all the officers involved even if they are not indicted. 

A Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-immunity-outliers/when-cops-kill-redress-is-rare-except-in-famous-cases-idUSKBN22K193 this year found U.S. police have been largely shielded from having to pay financial settlements to victims or their grieving families, except in high-profile cases.

The meeting on Friday in the Brazilian city of Boa Vista, near the border with Venezuela, is part of a Sept. 17-20 regional tour in which Pompeo will also visit and hold talks with the leaders of Colombia, Suriname and Guyana, the State Department said.
The whirlwind visit to Venezuela's neighbors comes as international efforts to advance democratic change in the country appear to have stalled and Maduro has asserted his grip on power despite political and economic upheaval that drove 5 million Venezuelans to flee.
The trip will ""highlight the United States' commitment to defend democracy,"" the State Department said. In Boa Vista, Pompeo will visit ""Venezuelan migrants fleeing the manmade disaster in Venezuela,"" it said in a statement.
Pompeo is scheduled to make a nearly 3-1/2-hour stop in Boa Vista on Friday afternoon. He will visit a triage center for receiving Venezuelan migrants and meet with Brazil's Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo, the Brazilian government said.
""They will talk about the Venezuelan refugees who have been so badly treated in their country,"" U.S. ambassador to Brazil, Todd Chapman, said on CNN Brasil. ""It is time for the illegitimate Maduro regime to go,"" he added, praising Brazil's humanitarian effort in receiving 250,000 Venezuelans.
Brazil's border with Venezuela has been closed since March 18 due to the coronavirus pandemic, and the flow of migrants crossing into Brazil has dropped from an average of 600 a day to a handful of Venezuelans who walk along cross-country trails.
U.S. sanctions targeting Venezuela's oil industry have slashed Caracas' crude exports to the lowest in decades, but they have failed to loosen Maduro's grip on power.

With the Nov. 3 U.S. election approaching, and leading Maduro critic President Donald Trump battling for a second term, Washington is expected to toughen its stance, especially with more sanctions targeting Venezuela's oil and gold industries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed agreements on Tuesday to normalize ties with Israel, becoming the first Arab states in a quarter century to break a longstanding taboo, in a strategic realignment of Middle East countries against Iran.
U.S. President Donald Trump hosted the White House ceremony, capping a dramatic month when first the UAE and then Bahrain agreed to reverse decades of ill will without a resolution of Israel's dispute with the Palestinians.
In front of a crowd of several hundred people on the White House lawn, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed accords with Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan and Bahrain’s Foreign Minister Abdullatif Al Zayani. 
The deals, denounced by the Palestinians, make them the third and fourth Arab states to take such steps to normalize relations since Israel signed peace treaties with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994.
Meeting Netanyahu earlier in the Oval Office, Trump said, ""We'll have at least five or six countries coming along very quickly"" to forge their own accords with Israel.
Later Trump told reporters a third Gulf Arab state, Saudi Arabia, would strike an agreement with Israel ""at the right time."" The Saudi cabinet stressed in a statement the need for a ""just and comprehensive solution"" to the Palestinian issue.
Saudi Arabia is the biggest Gulf Arab power. Its king is custodian of Islam's holiest sites and rules the world's largest oil exporter. Despite its own reluctance, the kingdom's quiet acquiescence to the agreements was seen as crucial.
'CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY'
The ceremony provided Trump with valuable imagery as he tries to hold on to power in a Nov. 3 presidential election. Flags of the United States, Israel, the UAE and Bahrain were in abundance. 
""We're here this afternoon to change the course of history,"" Trump said from the White House balcony.
Trump called the deals ""a major stride in which people of all faiths and backgrounds live together in peace and prosperity"" and declared that the three Middle East countries ""are going to work together, they are friends.""
The back-to-back agreements mark an improbable diplomatic victory for Trump. He has spent his presidency forecasting deals on such intractable problems as North Korea's nuclear program only to find achievements elusive.
Bringing Israel, the UAE and Bahrain together reflects their shared concern about Iran's rising influence in the region and development of ballistic missiles. Iran criticized both deals.
All three of the Middle East leaders hailed the agreements and Trump's role in glowing terms, with Netanyahu saying it gave hope to ""all the people of Abraham.""
But the UAE and Bahraini officials both sought to reassure the Palestinians that their countries were not abandoning them or their quest for statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, despite the Palestinian leadership having decried the deals as a betrayal of their cause.
In a sign that regional strife is sure to continue while the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains unresolved, Palestinian militants fired rockets from Gaza into Israel during the ceremony, the Israeli military said.
Israel's Magen David Adom ambulance service said paramedics treated two men for light injuries from flying glass in Ashdod, and four others suffered shock.
""This is not peace, this is surrender in return for the continuation of the aggression,"" read a tweet posted on the Twitter account of the Palestine Liberation Organization. ""There will be no peace before Palestine is free.""
TRUMP'S EVANGELICAL SUPPORT
With Trump seeking four more years, the accords could help shore up support among pro-Israel Christian evangelical voters, an important part of his political base.
Another target of the White House plans, in addition to Saudi Arabia, is Oman, whose leader spoke with Trump last week. Oman sent its ambassador to Tuesday's ceremony, a senior U.S. official said. No Saudi representative attended.
Meeting the Emirati foreign minister before the ceremony, Trump thanked the UAE for being first in the Gulf to agree to ties with Israel and left little doubt the Iran issue was overhanging the event. 
Trump predicted that Iran, under heavy U.S. sanctions, would want to reach a deal with Washington, which has been trying to get it to renegotiate an international nuclear accord. Tehran shows no sign of budging.
Netanyahu faces criticism at home of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and a corruption trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust that have led to frequent street protests.
Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing and describes his trial as a leftist political witch-hunt aimed at unseating a popular right-wing leader.
In a nod to the coronavirus, the White House encouraged but did not require participants to wear masks. It was left to the leaders whether to shake hands, and they did not do so in public. Most people in the crowd did not wear masks.
Some differences remain despite warming ties. Trump said on Tuesday he would have no problem selling advanced stealth F-35 fighter jets to the UAE, which for years has sought to obtain them. Israel, which has the F-35, objects to such a sale.
Frustrated by the Palestinians' refusal to take part in Trump's Middle East peace initiative, the White House has sought to bypass them in hopes they will see the deals with the UAE and Bahrain as incentives, even leverage, for peace talks.
Speaking to Fox News hours before the ceremony, Trump predicted the Palestinians would eventually forge peace with Israel or else be ""left out in the cold.""
The Palestinian leadership has long accused Trump of pro-Israel bias and denounced the Arab rapprochement with Israel, even though Netanyahu agreed, in return for normalization with the UAE, to suspend a plan to annex parts of the occupied West Bank.

Although Israeli-Palestinian negotiations broke down in 2014, some Gulf Arab states and several other Arab countries have long had quiet, informal contacts with Israel.

SACRAMENTO, Calif./WASHINGTON, D.C. (Reuters) - Air quality in five major cities in Oregon was the worst on record as the state continues to be blanketed by thick smoke from wildfires ravaging nearly 5 million acres in the U.S. West, environmental officials in the heavily forested state said.
The fires have generated so much smoke that along with hazardous air from California to Washington state, skies above the U.S. capital have also taken on a hazy din, thanks in part to smoke wafting thousands of miles from the West Coast.
The unprecedented wildfires – burning across a total of some 4.5 million acres (1.8 million hectares) as of Tuesday – have burned through towns in Oregon while also devouring forests in California, Washington and Idaho. The resulting blanket of ash and smoke has made the region’s air quality among the worst in the world. 
Hardest hit is Oregon, where tiny bits of smoke and ash known as particulates have reached the highest levels on record in Portland, Eugene, Bend, Medford and Klamath Falls, the state's Department of Environmental Quality said on Tuesday.
Air this week in all five cities was rated ""hazardous"" according to air quality standards, and in Bend, the air quality index topped 500, exceeding the air quality scale altogether, the department said.
Satellite images show that some of the smoke from the fires, traveling on the jet stream at high altitude, has wafted east as far as New York and Washington, D.C., according to the National Weather Service.
That smoke is not necessarily reducing the air quality near the ground, though. 
John Simko, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that generally, such particles are carried high on the wind and may not come close enough to earth to impact air quality.

He did not address air quality in a specific region of the country. But on Tuesday, measures of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, in New York and Washington, D.C., were within a range considered safe by U.S. standards.

The prime minister is facing a revolt from Tories dismayed at his proposal to break international law by unilaterally re-writing parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement he signed with the EU last year.
Johnson and other senior government figures held talks with one leading rebel in the party -- Bob Neill -- on Monday, but officials are still braced for an ugly fight over the proposals next week, people familiar with the matter said.
The prime minister’s Internal Market Bill passed its first parliamentary hurdle on Monday, but Neill and a dozen other Conservatives are trying to amend it to require the government to seek approval from MPs before exercising the most controversial powers the law will give it.
No deal has been done with the rebels yet, according to a person familiar with the situation, but Neill said Monday he wanted to give ministers the chance to address his concerns. A Downing Street official said the government was engaging with MPs in the normal way.
Bob Neill MP: Good Chance Of Amending Johnson’s Brexit Bill
Johnson’s plan to rip up parts of the EU withdrawal agreement threatens to blow apart the delicate negotiations over a future trade deal between the bloc and the U.K. The talks are already stuck, with just over three months left to reach a solution, and the EU has threatened legal action if Johnson doesn’t back down. Failure to reach an accord by the year-end would leave the U.K. facing disruption to trade with its nearest neighbor and chaos at its ports.
The row erupted after Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told MPs last week that the Internal Market Bill would break international law in “a limited and specific way.”
The government said the legislation aims to prevent the EU erecting trade barriers between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland if no agreement can be reached on future arrangements for the region.
But Lewis’s comments provoked a wave of anger. All five of Johnson’s living predecessors as prime minister have publicly expressed their concern at the damage his plan is doing to the U.K.’s international reputation as a reliable partner that respects the rule of law.
One government adviser resigned, and a cabinet minister has said he may do so if the law is broken eventually in a way he finds unacceptable.
Further confusion followed on Tuesday when one the U.K.’s top legal officials defended Johnson’s plans by insisting they don’t breach international law -- contradicting Lewis and the prime minister’s office.
Richard Keen, the Advocate General for Scotland, told the House of Lords the bill deals with a “contingent situation” in which the European Union would be in breach of its treaty obligations.
“The provisions of the bill are entirely limited in their intent and effect, and fall within the rule of law and the requirements of international law,” he said. “I certainly don’t anticipate that those provisions would be abused.”

Suga’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party is expected to use its majority in the powerful lower house of parliament to elect him to the post in a session that should start from about 1 p.m. Following the vote, Suga names his cabinet and the new ministers are likely to speak to the media before the end of the day.
Suga’s appointment, two days after he was selected as LDP leader, brings the curtain down on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s record run of almost eight consecutive years in the country’s top job. The 71-year-old Suga, who previously served as Abe’s right-hand man, has pledged to keep in place his former boss’s flexible fiscal stance and ultra-easy monetary policy known as “Abenomics.”
While Suga has pledged to pick reformers for his cabinet, Kyodo News and other media reports say he has already decided to retain key players Finance Minister Taro Aso and Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi. LDP Secretary General Toshihiro Nikai, a veteran political broker, will also stay in place under the new administration, the party announced Tuesday.
Speculation about an early general election has simmered following a surge in support for the cabinet. Suga has repeatedly said it would be difficult to hold a vote while the coronavirus outbreak is still spreading. The power to dissolve parliament for a general election lies with the prime minister, and none need be held for another year.
Suga has been outspoken on some specific issues, including the need for more competition among mobile phone providers to reduce costs for households. He has said Japan has too many regional financial institutions, and he is a strong proponent of introducing casino resorts to bolster tourism.
While Suga has little direct experience in diplomacy, he has said that Japan’s alliance with the U.S. will remain the cornerstone of its foreign policy and that he wants to maintain stable ties with China, his country’s biggest trading partner.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ohio's top election official declined to loosen restrictions on absentee-ballot drop boxes on Tuesday after a state judge ruled they were ""arbitrary and unreasonable"" and said local officials should be able to install more if they wish.
The ruling initially appeared to be a victory for Democrats who have pressed for more drop boxes to accommodate voters who don't want to return absentee ballots by mail in the Nov. 3 presidential election.
But Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, will not change rules that only allow one drop box for each of the state's 88 counties, spokeswoman Maggie Sheehan said.
""Today's ruling didn't change anything, and the secretary's directive remains in place,"" she said.
Drop boxes have become a partisan flash point in the presidential election. Democrats have promoted them as a reasonable and reliable option for voters unnerved by the COVID-19 pandemic and U.S. Postal Service delivery problems. 
Republican officials and President Donald Trump's campaign have sought to limit them in many states, arguing without evidence that the receptacles could enable voting fraud. 
In Ohio, LaRose's restrictions leave the 864,000 registered voters of Cuyahoga County, a Democratic stronghold, with the same number of drop boxes as the 8,400 registered voters of Republican-leaning Vinton County.
Opinion polls show Trump holding a narrow lead over Democratic rival Joe Biden in Ohio.
Ohio Judge Richard Frye ruled that local authorities can set up more drop boxes. ""Wholly arbitrary rules are entitled to no deference,"" he wrote.
Democrats said that should allow local officials to set up more drop boxes if they wish.
But the judge's decision did not strike down the rule outright, and Sheehan indicated LaRose may appeal. ""Ohioans are fortunate that the judicial branch offers the opportunity to appeal a single trial judge's opinion,"" she said.
Ohio Representative Paula Hicks-Hudson, a Democrat, said LaRose had told her he would follow any court ruling, rather than pursue an appeal. ""I'm calling on the secretary of state to keep his word,"" she said on a conference call. 
Democrats and Republicans have waged a state-by-state battle over absentee voting procedures ahead of the election, which could see up to half of all ballots sent through the mail.
In Pennsylvania, the state's top election official said on Monday that local officials can't discard returned mail ballots if the signature does not resemble one kept on file. 

In Arizona, a federal judge ruled last week that state officials must give voters a chance to fix ballots that are returned without a signature, rather than rejecting them outright.

The lottery, timed to end on the eve of Mexico's independence day festivities, is part of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's efforts to cast himself as a leader freeing the country from decades of graft.
He asked the Senate on Tuesday to allow a referendum next year on whether to investigate former presidents for corruption.
One-hundred winners, out of 6 million tickets offered, will each take home 20 million pesos, or just under $1 million. Last-minute interest jumped, with long lines at lottery booths.
The total prize money loosely represents the value of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner used by former President Enrique Pena Nieto that Lopez Obrador has cast as a symbol of excess and corruption in a country where about half the population lives in poverty. Mexico has struggled to find a buyer for the jet.
""The goal has already been reached,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters Tuesday morning.
The lottery marks an unorthodox government effort to boost health spending, with remaining proceeds destined for chronically underfunded public hospitals. The lottery is partly funded by sales of property mostly confiscated from alleged drug traffickers.
On Monday, authorities said only 70% of the 500 peso ($24) tickets had been sold, despite frenzied marketing by Lopez Obrador's allies, including one government agency spending about $24 million on the event.
Ahead of the 2:00 p.m. (1900 GMT) cut-off for sales, local media showed smiling buyers in the capital, proudly showing their tickets to television cameras.

Winning tickets are set to be announced at 4:00 p.m. local time.

Intersex refers to people who have reproductive or sexual anatomy that does not conform to typical definitions of male or female. 
The ombudsman, an independent organization that promotes human rights in Colombia, did not immediately include comparative figures from the same period in 2019 as collection of the information started this year. 
From January to August, the organization reported 388 cases of violence against LGBT and intersex people, mostly in the form of physical and psychological aggressions, up from 309 cases in the whole of last year. 
""During the pandemic prejudice and discrimination have been exacerbated while obstacles to accessing justice in the receiving of complaints increased,"" the ombudsman said in a statement.
The organization, which also cited 36 cases of aggression by police officers, called on the government to develop a concrete action plan to stop violence due to prejudice and fight institutional discrimination that affects this community in all areas and spaces.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday asked Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to appoint a special envoy to broker peace in Libya, although Russia and China abstained from voting on the resolution that also extended the U.N. mission in the country.
Ghassan Salame, who headed the U.N. political mission and was also charged with trying to mediate peace, quit in March due to stress. Guterres informally proposed a replacement, but the United States wanted the role split to have one person run the U.N. mission and a special envoy to focus on mediation.
The Security Council agreed to that proposal on Tuesday.
""With the new structure, we will have to present a new candidate and we will have to naturally consult with the Security Council for that purpose,"" Guterres told Reuters in an interview on Monday. 
The Security Council traditionally agrees - informally - by consensus to such appointments. Several months ago, the United States proposed that Guterres appoint former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt to be special envoy, but diplomats said she had since withdrawn herself. 
Russia and China said they abstained on the resolution on Tuesday because it did not include their suggested amendments. 
Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Since 2014, it has been split, with an internationally recognized government controlling the capital, Tripoli, and the northwest, while military leader Khalifa Haftar in Benghazi rules the east.
Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the government is backed by Turkey.

""I'm shocked with the fact that so many spoilers, so many countries, have been interfering with the Libyan situation, building up military capacity on both sides ... completely disregarding resolutions of the Security Council in relation to the arms embargo, or mercenaries,"" Guterres told Reuters.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The ramparts of Jerusalem, built for battle, were commandeered for a messaging war between Israelis and Palestinians in the build-up to Israel's normalisation deals with two Gulf Arab states.
During the White House signing ceremony Israel projected flags of Israel, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and the U.S. onto the Old City walls as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood alongside President Donald Trump in Washington hailing what he called ""historic"" peace agreements.
But the same walls, built in the 16th century by Turkish sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, were also used by Palestinians to proclaim their opposition to deals that they see as a betrayal by their fellow Arabs.
A week after the Israel-Emirates deal was announced, Palestinians draped a black banner of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas over the wall near Damascus Gate with the accompanying headline ""The rightful owner"".
It continued: ""We call upon the government of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates to revert to the inclusive Arab and Islamic position and to withdraw from the shameful agreement.""
Jerusalem, claimed by both sides for their capital, lies at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Israel views all of Jerusalem, including the walled Old City that it captured in the 1967 Middle East war, as its ""eternal and indivisible"" capital.
But Palestinians want East Jerusalem - including the Old City - to be the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Travel restrictions and a shift to online learning has dramatically cut the number of international students expected to attend Canadian universities and colleges this fall, and the decline will ripple through Canada's labor market.
New study permits for foreign students issued by Canada fell by 22.3% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with the same period of 2019, amid strict COVID-19 border controls that have blocked many new foreign students from entering Canada.
While fall semester enrollment is not yet finalized, Canadian schools are expecting a ""significant"" drop in international students, according to their advocacy groups, which will slash billions from college and university revenues.
The decline will also have a ripple effect through the private sector, said Denise Amyot, chief executive of Colleges and Institutes Canada. 
""A lot of SMEs (small, medium enterprises) are worried because often those international students are enrolled into fields where they are less domestic students,"" she said.
This means a potential labor shortage for some employers, with fewer students in the near-term for work placements and internships, and then a longer-term dip in new graduates entering the labor force.
Canada's unemployment rate was near a 40-year-low before the pandemic. While some 3 million jobs were lost at the height of the lockdowns, some two-thirds have since been recouped.
Many foreign students go into in-demand sectors like health services, business administration, mining and manufacturing, and information technology, along with emerging technologies, say educators.
The problem is particularly pressing in rural or remote regions of Canada, where the workforce is rapidly aging and young people tend to leave for major urban centers.
""Immigration and international students are a key part of our population growth strategy in Atlantic Canada,"" said Joel Richardson, spokesman for Cooke Aquaculture, a fast-growing Canadian seafood producer with operations in 10 countries.
The company was already struggling with a labor gap before restrictions shut the border. Now it has about 100 domestic job openings, and is facing the added strain of less international students on local campuses who it typically hires after graduation for office and skilled labor roles. A worker shortage has prompted the company to also offer part-time and summer processing jobs to students.
""We have a lot of need for people with international backgrounds and multilinguistic capabilities,"" said Richardson.
TICKET TO CITIZENSHIP
Studying at a Canadian university or college has long been a pathway to citizenship for skilled foreign workers and the lure has grown in recent years, in part due to the political climate south of the border under U.S. President Donald Trump.
New study permits issued to international students by Canada jumped 52.2% from 2016 to 2019. 
That boom had been a windfall for Canadian universities and colleges, as foreign students pay far more than domestic ones for the same courses. Foreign students contribute an estimated C$21.6 billion ($16.4 billion) to Canada's GDP each year, according to a 2018 government estimate.
While some students with valid study permits are allowed in to Canada, most first-years are not. College advocacy groups want the rules loosened, with clearer guidelines. Many universities have set up formal quarantine programs for international students who do get in.
Centennial College in Toronto, where international students typically make up 40-50% of the student body, has reworked dozens of its programs to run entirely online for the fall. It expects international enrollment to be 25% below its pre-COVID targets.
""We have an aging population, so we need to bring in skilled people to the country,"" Virginia Macchiavello, the school's international director, said. ""We need to change our mindset from, 'these are just international students.' They're future Canadians.""

LEH, India (Reuters) - From deploying mules to large transport aircraft, India's military has activated its entire logistics network to transport supplies to thousands of troops for a harsh winter along a bitterly disputed Himalayan border with China.
In recent months, one of India's biggest military logistics exercises in years has brought vast quantities of ammunition, equipment, fuel, winter supplies and food into Ladakh, a region bordering Tibet that India administers as a union territory, officials said.
The move was triggered by a border stand-off with China in the snow deserts of Ladakh that began in May and escalated in June into hand-to-hand combat. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed while China suffered an undisclosed number of casualties.
Both countries are negotiating to resolve the confrontation, but neither side has backed down. The Indian military is now set to keep troops deployed along the treacherous, high-altitude border through the winter.
Eastern Ladakh, where the flare-up occurred, is typically manned by 20,000-30,000 soldiers. But the deployment has more than doubled with the tensions, a military official said, declining to provide exact numbers.
""We have mirrored the increase in Chinese troops,"" the official said, adding the Indian military was well-prepared but did not want further escalation or a prolonged conflict.
Temperatures in Ladakh can fall well below freezing, and troops are often deployed at altitudes of over 15,000 feet, where oxygen is scarce, officials said.
Since snow blocks mountain passes into Ladakh at least four months every winter, Indian military planners have already moved more than 150,000 tonnes of materials into the region.
""All the supplies that we need have already been pushed to wherever they are required,"" said Major General Arvind Kapoor, chief of staff of the Indian army's 14 Corps.
FERRYING TO THE FRONTLINE
On Tuesday morning, a succession of the Indian air force's large transport aircraft landed at a forward base in Ladakh, carrying men and materials, as fighter jets roared overhead.
Soldiers with backpacks streamed out and were checked for COVID-19 symptoms at a transit facility, where they awaited further transport.
The materials are stored across a network of logistics hubs.
At a fuel, oil and lubricant depot near Leh, Ladakh's main city, a hillside was covered with clusters of green drums.
At storage facilities at a nearby supply depot, boxes and sacks of ration - including pistachios, instant noodles and Indian curries - stood in tall piles. At another base near Leh, tents, heaters, winter clothing and high-altitude equipment lay stacked.
From these depots, the materials are pushed to logistics nodes by trucks, helicopters and, in some particularly difficult parts, mules, officials said.

""In a place like Ladakh, operations logistics is of huge importance,"" said Kapoor. ""In the last 20 years, we have mastered it.""

Next to it is a plaque reading ""This statue is dedicated to the eternal memory of a monument to Melania which stood in this location"". 
The original wooden statue commissioned by Berlin-based American artist Brad Downey was carved with a chainsaw by local folk artist Ales Zupevc.
The wooden figure was painted with a pale blue wraparound coat resembling the one Trump wore at the swearing in of her husband U.S. President Donald Trump. The new bronze statue has no colours.

In January, a large wooden statue resembling Donald Trump and designed by a local artist in 2019, was burnt in Slovenia's city of Moravce, east of the capital Ljubljana.

Traore ousted Modibo Keita, Mali's first democratically elected president since the West African nation's independence from France in 1960, and ruled until 1991 when he himself was overthrown in a military takeover.
""Yes, I can confirm that he died today,"" said junta spokesman Captain Djibrilla Maiga. 
Traore's 23-year rule was marked by widespread rights abuses. In 1993, a Mali court found him guilty of the murder of 106 people who participated in the demonstrations that led to his downfall.
He was condemned to death but the sentence was later commuted, and he was pardoned in 2002.
Traore was forced out after he was arrested by soldiers following weeks of protests in March 1991.
Mali has struggled to find stability since independence, and the last decade has been marked by militant violence after a Tuareg rebellion in 2012 was hijacked by al Qaeda-linked jihadists who occupied most of the north of the country.

Former president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita came to power in 2013 promising an end to the chaos. But his rule ended abruptly in a coup on Aug. 18, following months of popular protests - marking the country's second military coup in eight years.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The European Union is calling for close monitoring of the human rights situation in Belarus by the U.N. human rights chief, adding to pressure on Minsk following what it calls a ""fraudulent election"", a draft document showed on Tuesday.
The resolution seen by Reuters will be brought before the U.N. human rights council in Geneva as members prepare to hold an urgent debate on Friday on alleged human rights violations in Belarus, where President Alexander Lukashenko won re-election last month to perpetuate 26 years in power. 
Lukashenko denies that the vote was rigged, saying foreign powers are behind protests aimed at reversing the result.
The document lists a litany of alleged abuses including killings, systemic torture, enforced disappearances and abductions and arbitrary detentions.
""The Human Rights Council...expresses deep concern about the overall human rights situation in Belarus, and its deterioration in the run-up and particularly in the aftermath of the fraudulent presidential election on 9 August 2020,"" the draft resolution said.
The draft, due to be submitted by Germany, can be modified to get more countries on board. However, it is expected to be approved in its current form since it stops short of calling for a commission of inquiry - a more drastic measure reserved for the worst human rights crises.
It seeks two formal updates from the U.N. top rights official, Michelle Bachelet, on the situation there, an oral one with recommendations by year-end and a written one at the next council session in early 2021. It also calls for the U.N. Special Rapporteur to have ""free, full and unhindered access"". 
Bachelet's office cannot force countries to take action on her findings but her voice carries moral authority.

Belarus, which objected strongly to the debate proposal when it was introduced on Monday, is not currently a member of the council and cannot block it.

Protesters are demanding more staff and support from authorities as the recent surge in cases, at a time when pupils are returning to schools, prompted concerns about further infections.
The health ministry reported 3,022 new coronavirus infections and 19 deaths in the past 24 hours.
The number of cases was little changed from Monday's in an apparent stabilisation after a steady surge that began in July and peaked at around 12,000 cases 11 days ago.
The infection numbers are updated retroactively and have often ended up exceeding the initial daily tally by thousands. Spain's cumulative number of cases, at 603,167, is the highest in Western Europe. The number of deaths exceeded 30,000.
Bilbao's teachers unions called for staff numbers to be bolstered after regional authorities shut a primary school in the northern Basque Country on Sept. 10 after several teachers tested positive.
""We are going through a situation in which we have to apply a protocol that many of us don't support and moreover we don't have the resources to do it,"" teacher Garazi Pizarro told Reuters.
Teachers' unions and parent groups have criticised the government for making health and safety plans at the last minute, but Education Minister Isabel Celaa said the reopening had gone well, with cases detected in only a few dozen places.
Separately on Tuesday, health workers in the Spanish capital protested against what they said was a lack of support from regional health authorities, and also called for better working conditions.

""We have a human problem. If health workers are already starting to get sick in September, we don't want to imagine what it will be like in December,"" said ICU nurse Victor Aparicio, as nurses and doctors blocked roads near Madrid's Gregorio Maranon hospital, holding banners and chanting.

LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - Greek police have detained six migrants over a fire that razed the Moria refugee camp to the ground, the government said on Tuesday, as thousands of displaced people refused to move to a new facility and demanded to leave Lesbos island. 
More than 12,000 people, mostly refugees from Afghanistan, Africa and Syria, were left without shelter, proper sanitation or access to food and water after a fire tore through the overcrowded Moria migrant camp last Wednesday.
Greek authorities believe the fire was deliberately lit by camp occupants after quarantine measures were imposed following the discovery of COVID cases on the site, but the incident has put the migrant issue firmly back on the European agenda.
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis repeated a call for more help from the European Union, which has struggled to find a unified approach to the migrant crisis at its borders, saying it was time for ""tangible solidarity"" from Europe.
European Council President Charles Michel who visited Lesbos said the challenge was European not just Greek and urged for more commitment by EU members for a new migration policy to be effective.
""This is difficult, a very complex situation, but on behalf of the European Union, I would want to say that I refuse to paper over this migration challenge. This is a common European challenge,"" Michel said. 
Government officials in Berlin said Germany could take in up to 1,500 people stranded by the fire, in addition to 100-150 Berlin has already agreed to take in. But a wider solution has remained elusive.
Mitsotakis said a permanent new reception facility would be built on Lesbos with EU support and that the notoriously overcrowded and squalid Moria camp ""belongs to the past"".
On the ground in Lesbos, however, thousands, including children, were still sleeping rough a week after the blaze.
Officials were struggling to overcome resistance from migrants hoping to be allowed to leave the island who fear that life in temporary shelters being erected would be no better than the conditions they endured in Moria.
Migrants wearing masks as a precaution against the coronavirus queued outside the camp gates to receive water, food and blankets from aid workers. The task was complicated by the need for COVID-19 tests, with at least 25 positive cases found among the displaced.
""The big concern is that even though many thousands of places are available and will continue to be expanded, there are still less than 1,000 that have been occupied,"" said Luciano Calestini, head of the Greece office of the United Nations childrens organisation UNICEF.

Only a few hundred migrants, mainly unaccompanied minors, have been moved off Lesbos. Greek officials have said there will be no mass transfers and all asylum seekers will have to go into the new shelter.

542,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 01:01PM ET</span>",Special Report: U.S. troops battling racism report high barrier to justice,"By Phil Stewart, M.B. Pell and Joshua Schneyer
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - By the time he saw a swastika scrawled in the bathroom at Barksdale Air Force base in October 2018, Deven Sherk was already disillusioned with how the Air Force handled racism complaints. The Black airman had filed a complaint alleging discrimination that June when a fellow airman, a white man, hung a noose near him on the base.
“I felt that was a direct threat to my life,” said Sherk, who was a staff sergeant specializing in B-52 bomber maintenance at the time.
Along with the noose, he reported seeing a whip on display at the hangar where he worked, with slogans including “Fuckin Attitude Adjuster” written in marker. Sherk says he never felt the Air Force's Equal Opportunity office took seriously his complaints of racism. So, he decided against filing a formal complaint about the swastika.
By February of 2019, the Air Force said it quietly censured several people over Sherk’s complaint, but the sergeant’s career was over. He says he found himself pushed out of the service with an honorable discharge after suffering depression and anxiety.
“Incidents like these must stop,” an Air Force spokeswoman said of Sherk’s case. “We are committed to ensuring our Air Force is a place of respect, diversity and inclusion.”
As America confronts the question of systemic racial injustice, the U.S. military, which has long promoted itself as an egalitarian system focused on merit and achievement, is undergoing its own moment of reckoning.
Earlier this summer, as the military braced for a deployment amid nationwide protests over police violence against Black Americans, top defense officials acknowledged a lack of diversity among leadership. The Air Force’s newly appointed first Black chief of staff supported these concerns when he shared his own stories of bias during his climb to the top. The Army is grappling with calls to rechristen bases named for Confederate generals. And the Pentagon has launched an initiative to “ensure equal opportunity across all ranks.”
But interviews with dozens of current and former U.S. service members reveal deep skepticism about whether coming forward with concrete allegations of discrimination will be beneficial. Especially daunting, they say, is using the complaint process specifically set up to address concerns from members of the Armed Forces.
So-called Equal Opportunity offices are located on U.S. military bases around the world, established to give troops access to some of the protections against discrimination that American civilians can tap through a separate system, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity. Troops, who are not considered employees, have the right to seek investigations through EO offices.
But many service members, including Sherk, say the EO process is often a dead end, resulting in little action, or worse, backfiring on the complainant. That’s because filing an EO complaint is often viewed as an act of defiance in the military, they say.
Data obtained by Reuters show that service members rarely file formal EO complaints when compared to their civilian employee counterparts within the Defense Department. The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines employ some 1.3 million active duty personnel, about double the civilian workforce. But civilians file far more complaints than troops.
Last year, 71 sailors formally complained of discrimination on the basis of race or color, one-sixth as many as the 404 complaints filed by the Navy's smaller civilian workforce. Navy uniformed personnel filed about 21 complaints per 100,000 personnel while their civilian co-workers filed about 200.
The Army saw 107 formal Equal Opportunity complaints by soldiers involving racial discrimination in 2019, one-fifth the number filed by its civilian workforce. The Air Force reported 92 formal complaints in 2019 involving race and color from a force of 400,000 active duty or reserve airmen. That was a third of the number filed by civilians in the service.
The vast gap between uniformed military complaints and those of their civilian counterparts in the Army, Navy and Air Force has not been previously reported. Few troops’ complaints were substantiated in 2019: 6% in the Navy and 18% and 35%, respectively, in the Air Force and Army. Reuters does not have sufficient data to compare those rates to outcomes of civilian complaints.
“There is a career downside risk to coming forward and rocking the boat,” said Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat who leads the Military Personnel panel on the House Armed Services Committee.
In corporate America, and in government jobs, too, employees can sue their employer over discrimination. Not so for U.S. troops, who enter a process in which the military investigates itself, said Don Christensen, a retired chief prosecutor for the Air Force.
“There's not much incentive to use the process because it rarely works, and they rarely rule in their favor,” said Christensen, who leads the advocacy group Protect Our Defenders, whose research has drawn attention to racial discrimination in the military.
Informal complaints focus on finding an agreeable resolution and can include mediation. The formal complaints process is the most in-depth form of inquiry.
That system begins when a service member fills out an EO form that kick-starts the process. From there, an investigating officer is appointed by a commander and conducts interviews and collects evidence, from photographs to emails and evaluations, that could indicate racial bias.
EO officials work to ensure that service members understand the process and are kept up to date on developments. But ultimately, military commanders decide whether a complaint is founded and, if so, what punitive action should follow. A military judge advocate can provide input.
The Pentagon, presented with Reuters’ findings, said survey data show service members prefer to take complaints to their chain of command instead of an EO office. And, the military explicitly encourages troops to first attempt to resolve their cases at the lowest command level before going to an EO officer.
Some say the system is wrought by an inherent conflict of interest. The only way to improve the process “is to completely remove the reporting system from the chain of command,” said Captain Deshauna Barber, a Black officer in the Army Reserve and activist on behalf of women service members.
The end result of fewer complaints, Reuters found, is that the military is likely less aware of discrimination happening day-to-day than it would be if U.S. troops were incentivized to come forward.
The Pentagon said it encourages reporting of “problematic behaviors.” But it acknowledged troops’ concerns about the EO process and said Defense Secretary Mark Esper has directed the military’s independent Inspector Generals to investigate the efficacy of the program.
DISPARITY AT THE TOP
The U.S. armed forces have great racial and gender diversity at lower ranks, but the top brass is predominantly white and male, a fact made plain in a revealing photo last year of President Donald Trump surrounded by American military leaders, with not a single woman or Black officer in sight at the time.
From the halls of the Pentagon to the military academies, minorities who make up more than a third of the armed forces are starting to speak out about a culture that, they say, creates a feeling of exclusion.
After becoming the first Black American to be the top-ranked cadet at West Point in 2018, Army First Lieutenant Simone Askew said in a letter circulated online that she found a photoshopped picture of her, slipped under her door, “with a monkey's face over my own.”
“More racist caricatures and comments continued to circulate online. One of the popular images even depicted me as Satan himself,” Askew wrote. She declined to comment.
Askew's testimony was included in a June letter by a group of prominent graduates and cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point that denounced pervasive racism in the Army's most hallowed institution. It came less than two weeks after President Trump delivered a commencement address there.
“I had a racist roommate that would call me the n-word and spit on me,” said a cadet in another example cited in the letter.
The U.S. Military Academy said it received the letter and that the West Point Inspector General “has begun a comprehensive review of all matters involving race.” A spokesman added, “The Academy expects all Cadets to be treated with dignity and respect.”
Air Force General Charles Brown Jr made history on August 6 by taking over as the first Black chief of a U.S. military service. Before assuming command, Brown candidly recounted in a video his experiences with discrimination during his career.
In one example, he spoke of wearing the same flight suit and wings as his peers “and then being questioned by another military member: ‘Are you a pilot?’”
One sailor stationed in Naples, Italy, took the opportunity to address racism in a town hall July 17 with Defense Secretary Esper and General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
“In my experience in the Navy, although it's been a great one, I ran into some people that only judged me by the color of my skin, and not by the quality of my work,” said Operations Specialist First Class Heandel Pierre. Milley replied that U.S. troops were “willing to die” for core American principles like equality.
U.S. military leaders appear to be listening, taking stands that clashed with Trump after he defended people flying the Confederate flag and threatened to militarize the U.S. response to protests of the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Esper opposed using active duty troops to quell protests. He has issued a de facto ban on the flag of the Confederacy, the breakaway Southern states that waged war on the United States to preserve slavery. General Milley, Trump's top military adviser, has called for a hard look at U.S. military facilities named after Confederate generals.
Milley recalled in July how a Black Army staff sergeant once told him at North Carolina’s Fort Bragg that they “went to work everyday on a base that represented a guy who enslaved his grandparents.” Fort Bragg, one America’s largest military bases, was named after Confederate general Braxton Bragg.
NO RELIEF
Lieutenant Commander Kimberly Young-McLear said she contemplated suicide in the weeks after announcing her intention to file a formal EO complaint at the Coast Guard Academy in 2016, where she was a professor, alleging workplace bullying tied to her race, gender and sexual orientation.
Young-McLear said she was subjected to degrading comments, her work was undermined and her reputation damaged. As she pressed her accusations, Young-McLear said she was retaliated against with a lower performance evaluation – an allegation confirmed by an inspector general’s investigation.
Even after being vindicated, she worries that little has changed. “Either people are too afraid to report because they don't trust the system because of retaliation, or if it is reported, it gets immediately swept under the rug,” she said.
A June report by the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General found repeated failures in the Coast Guard Academy's response to discrimination complaints. Many cadets surveyed said they understood how to report harassment, “but may not do so out of fear of negative consequences,” the report said.
The Coast Guard told Reuters it was working on improvements and that it recognized “there are members that still experience discrimination, bullying and harassment.”
Many service members conclude they’d gain little by filing formal complaints. “If you want to progress, you don't make a whole lot of waves, do you? There's no great incentive to come forward,” said Vincent Stewart, a retired Marine three star general.
LESSONS FROM SEXUAL ASSAULT
The full extent of discrimination in the military is unclear. The latest publicly available Pentagon data dates to a 2013 survey, which said some 16% of minorities in the active duty force experienced harassment, discrimination or both because of their race or ethnicity.
A higher percentage, 39%, of minorities reported potentially discriminatory behavior prohibited by Pentagon policy, anything from racist jokes to offensive remarks about their accents or language skills. Thirty percent said they considered leaving the military. Still, the vast majority didn’t report the issues to anyone.
Advocates say the military’s handling of sexual assaults provides additional clues that the problem is greater than the number of EO complaints would indicate.
In the latest Defense Department survey, in 2018, nearly one out of every four female service members indicated experiencing behavior consistent with sexual harassment. That would suggest over 50,000 women. But the actual number of formal harassment complaints was 1,021 last year. Advocates see a parallel with racial bias concerns.
Maryland Rep. Anthony Brown, a retired Army Reserve colonel and the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus on the House Armed Services Committee, secured House passage of an amendment that would require more regular surveys on racism and white supremacy. The aim is to create a consistent set of data on racism that’s closer to what is available on sexual assault and harassment.
Disciplinary data and reports by government agencies and nonprofit advocates reveal racial disparities in the military’s rate of investigations and punishments.
A 2019 report by the congressional watchdog U.S. Government Accountability Office said Black service members were more than twice as likely as whites to face judicial investigations in the Coast Guard, Army, Navy and Marine Corps from 2013-2017.
Blacks were also about twice as likely to be tried in courts-martial in the Army, Navy and Marines, the GAO found. In the Air Force, Blacks were about 1.5 times more likely to face a court martial.
SUPREME COURT CHALLENGE
In the regimented world of the U.S military, service members accept that they cannot exercise all the liberties enjoyed by civilians. They do not have the same freedoms of speech, are not free to leave their jobs whenever they choose and can be court martialed if they attempt to do so. Given the risk of death or injury in war, under longstanding legal precedent they cannot sue if killed in combat, by accident, or even from medical malpractice.
One former service member is trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in on troops' inability to sue over racial discrimination.
Gary Jackson, who was discharged from the Marine Corps nearly three decades ago, is trying to sue the Navy, alleging discrimination that ultimately cut short his career. He said a supervisor transferred him at a Marine base in Arlington, Virginia, and then said, “That’s one less Black Staff Sergeant,” according to a written statement by a witness submitted in the case.
If Jackson prevailed, troops could seek legal recourse under Civil Rights Act protections against workplace discrimination. But legal experts are unsure whether the Supreme Court will agree later this year to take up the issue, seeing the case as a longshot after lower courts ruled against him.
In an amicus brief in support of Jackson’s motion, Protect Our Defenders and another advocacy group, the Black Veterans Project, called the EO process a “woefully inadequate system for addressing racial bias or discrimination.”
Sherk, the airman shown the noose, said his final months in uniform left their mark. Before leaving the service in 2019, he was accused of dereliction of duty involving an unattended aircraft. Sherk fought the charge, saying the incident at the Louisiana military base was not his fault, and in a court martial hearing was found not guilty. The Air Force declined comment on his case.
Asked about Sherk’s reports about the noose and other allegations, the Air Force said several service members faced administrative action, which can include a censure, but did not elaborate.

Reuters saw a single letter of reprimand given to an airman over the noose incident, which Sherk obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. In the letter, the Air Force wrote, “a noose represents lynching; a historic act used to traumatize African Americans into obedience and segregation.”
These days, Sherk said he is piecing his life back together after the loss of his military career, selling used cars in Detroit.
“I feel cheated,” Sherk said. “This is not what I imagined myself doing.”

Yavuz will be accompanied by three other Turkish ships, according to a maritime notice that added ""all vessels are strongly advised not to enter"" the area.
Cyprus' internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government has long been at loggerheads with Turkey, which began drilling for oil and gas near Cyprus last year.
The island was split after a 1974 Turkish invasion spurred by a brief coup engineered by the military then ruling Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in north Cyprus is recognised only by Ankara.
Turkey questions Cyprus' right to explore in the seas around the island because it maintains that the Nicosia administration does not represent the interests of Turkish Cypriots. 
That argument is dismissed by Cyprus, which is legally recognised as representing the entire island.
In a separate dispute between Turkey and Greece, the two countries are at odds over the delimitation of their continental shelves. 

Greece said on Tuesday it was ready for talks with Turkey following the withdrawal of a Turkish exploration vessel from a disputed region.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny shared a photograph from a Berlin hospital on Tuesday, sitting up in bed and surrounded by his family, and said he could now breathe independently after being poisoned in Siberia last month.
The photo - the strongest evidence yet of Navalny's advancing recovery after emerging from a coma last week - was swiftly followed by confirmation from his press spokeswoman that he planned to return to Russia. 
""Hi, this is Navalny. I miss you all,"" he wrote in the caption to his Instagram followers. ""I can still hardly do anything, but yesterday I could breathe all day on my own. Actually on my own."" 
The leading opponent of President Vladimir Putin, fell violently sick while campaigning on Aug. 20 and was airlifted to Berlin. Germany says laboratory tests in three countries have determined he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent, and Western governments have demanded an explanation from Russia.
Moscow has called the accusations groundless. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reiterated on Tuesday that Moscow was open to clearing up what happened to Navalny, but needed access to information on his case from Berlin.
He said Moscow did not understand why, if French and Swedish laboratories had been able to test his medical samples, Russia was not being given the same access.
The case has further strained relations between Russia and the West, already at a post-Cold War low since Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and the attempted poisoning of a former Russian double agent with the same Novichok nerve agent in England in 2018.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has faced calls to punish Russia by suspending work on Nord Stream 2, a nearly completed pipeline bringing gas from Russia to Germany.
'NO OTHER OPTIONS' 
The photograph showed Navalny looking towards the camera, with his wife Yulia supporting him with her arms and their two children looking on.
The New York Times on Tuesday quoted a German security official as saying Navalny had spoken to a German prosecutor about the incident and said he planned to return to Russia as soon as he recovered.
Confirming the report, Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh wrote on Twitter: ""No other options were ever considered.""
Asked for comment, Peskov said: ""Any citizen of the Russian Federation is free to leave Russia and return to Russia. If a citizen of the Russian Federation recovers his health, then of course everyone will be happy about that.""
The Kremlin has for years regarded Navalny with contempt. In a rare departure from his normal practice of referring to ""the Berlin patient"", Peskov spoke the opposition leader's name on Tuesday.
Navalny, 44, has not been allowed to form a political party but has riled Putin for the past decade with detailed campaigns exposing official corruption, bypassing the state-controlled media by using Instagram and YouTube.

In his social media post, he even attempted a flash of humour, saying that breathing naturally was ""an amazing process, underestimated by many. I'd recommend it.""

Senior conservative lawmaker Detlef Seif said the British plan to pass legislation that breaks its divorce treaty with the European Union, in a breach of international law, undermined Britain's credibility as a negotiating partner.
""The United Kingdom was for me, in the past, always a state that upheld the rule of law and with which one could negotiate,"" Seif, who is Brexit rapporteur for the CDU/CSU Bundestag group of Merkel's conservatives, told Reuters.
""But with this behavior, Britain is joining the ranks of despots and regimes like those in Russia, Turkey, China and North Korea. I don't think Britain wants to be included in that group, but it has earned that classification.""
The British government said explicitly last week that it plans to break international law by breaching parts of the Withdrawal Agreement treaty that it signed in January, when it formally left the EU.
Johnson lashed out at the EU on Monday as he won initial approval for the plan to breach the Brexit treaty, saying the move was needed because the bloc had refused to take a ""revolver off the table"" in trade talks.
Johnson said it was essential to counter ""absurd"" threats from Brussels including that London put up trade barriers between Britain and Northern Ireland, which is a part of the United Kingdom.
The EU says Johnson's bill would wreck trade talks and propel the United Kingdom toward a messy, no-deal Brexit.

NAJAF, Iraq (Reuters) - It took Abu Haider and his relatives several hours to dig up his nephew's grave and exhume the body at a cemetery in the southern Iraqi city of Najaf built especially for COVID-19 victims.
When they had finished, they shrouded the body in white sheets, loaded it on to the back of a pickup truck and set off to re-inter it in Najaf's old ""Valley of Peace"" graveyard, the traditional resting place for Iraq's Shi'ites.
In doing so, Abu Haider is not only reliving the pain of losing a loved one to the coronavirus pandemic that has infected nearly 300,000 Iraqis and killed more than 8,000.
He is also defying an order from religious leaders who consider the new cemetery to be a legitimate burial place.
Rashid al-Husseini, a representative of Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, was critical of people moving corpses.
""We must not dig up Muslim graves, this is clear among religious leaders, in their positions and in their books,"" he said.
Abu Haider, a practicing Shi'ite, said he had no choice but to defy the edict.
""We didn't see our dead, the coronavirus victims, we were not allowed to be with them, they were buried quite randomly,"" he told Reuters, after driving more than 300 km (186 miles) from Maysan province in eastern Iraq to move his nephew's remains.
The old cemetery is where members of his family have been buried for generations.
After the outbreak of the pandemic in Iraq, some tribes and religious authorities in different parts of the country refused to bury victims of the coronavirus in local cemeteries, fearing that corpses could still be contagious.
This was the main reason behind the creation of a special cemetery for COVID-19 victims, Abdul Hassan Kadhim, leader of the burial team composed of volunteers from a state-sponsored paramilitary group told Reuters in June.
So far, over 4,000 COVID-19 victims from across the country and belonging to different religious sects have been buried in Najaf's new cemetery.
In the first months, burials were often done in the middle of the night and with only one family member allowed to attend. Many relatives of COVID-19 victims felt they had not been able to properly mourn their dead.
Following guidance from the World Health Organization that the risk of post-mortem contagion appeared to be low, Iraqi health authorities last week issued a statement allowing families to rebury the bodies of the deceased, under certain conditions.

Despite resistance from the highest Shi'ite authority, dozens of families have moved relatives' remains from the new burial ground to the old, hoping they will never have to set foot in what they call ""the coronavirus cemetery"" again.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Turkey must rein in Syrian rebels it supports in northern Syria who may have carried out kidnappings, torture and looting of civilian property, United Nations war crimes investigators said on Tuesday.
The panel also said transfers of Syrian nationals detained by the opposition Syrian National Army to Turkish territory for prosecution may amount to the war crime of unlawful deportation.
In a report covering the first half of 2020, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria said assassinations and rapes of civilians by all sides, marked by ""sectarian undertones"", were on the rise in the conflict that began in 2011.
""In Afrin, Ras al Ain and the surrounding areas, the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army may have committed the war crimes of hostage-taking, cruel treatment, torture and rape,"" panel chair Paulo Pinheiro told a news briefing. 
""Turkey should act to prevent these abuses and ensure the protection of civilians in the areas under its control,"" he said.
Turkey's Defence Ministry says it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties during military operations in Syria.
Ankara and Moscow back opposing sides in Syria. Russia, along with Iran, supports President Bashar al-Assad's forces and Turkey backs rebels trying to oust him. Turkey seized control of the border town of Ras al Ain last year in an offensive to push back Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters, which Ankara views as a terrorist group.
Turkey wields influence as it funded, trained and allowed the rebel force known as the Syrian National Army to enter Syria from Turkey, panelist Hanny Megally said.
""Whilst we can't say Turkey is in charge of them and issues orders and has command control over them, we think that it could use its influence much more to bring them into check and certainly to pressure them to desist from the violations being committed and to investigate them,"" he said.
Investigations carried out so far by the Syrian National Army are insufficient, even as violations increase, he added.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A $1.5 billion loan from Russia will shore up Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko for the time being as he tries to face down mass protests, but not for long.
Lukashenko, whose security forces have arrested thousands of opposition supporters demanding his resignation, secured the financial lifeline from Russian President Vladimir Putin at a Black Sea summit on Monday.
But the actual cash available to him - for example, to pay his police force or raise salaries to lure back striking workers - will be much smaller than the headline figure.
According to Artyom Shraibman, a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center, only a fraction of the funds will actually make it to Minsk, given it needs to refinance another $1 billion in loans, including from Russia, and pay $300 million of debt to Russian energy giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) by the end of the year. 
""In reality this is money being transferred from one Russian pocket to another,"" said Pavel Latushko, a prominent member of the Belarusian opposition council.
Sofia Donets, chief economist at Renaissance Capital in Moscow, said: ""The loan is basically not new money, but the refinancing of the existing debt of Belarus (to Russia), part of which is repayable next year.""
Almost half of the total external public debt of Belarus is due to Russia, she said. It faces external debt payments of about $2.6 billion next year, mainly split between Russia and China.
WORSENING ECONOMY
Besides facing the gravest political crisis of his 26-year rule, Lukashenko is in deepening economic trouble.
Gross Domestic Product fell 1.3% between January and August, the official news agency Belta said on Tuesday. In August alone, the central bank burned through $1.4 billion, or about a sixth of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, as it fought to shore up the rouble currency.
Belarusian companies and banks are also highly exposed. Russian credit ratings agency ACRA said they had external debt of about $9 billion as of July 1, and the government may end up shouldering some of that because of their limited scope to reschedule during the current crisis.
ACRA estimates Belarusian debt to Russia at around $7.9 billion, or 12-13% of GDP as of April 1 this year.
Lukashenko has relied heavily for the past two decades on Russian financial support for Belarus's stagnating economy. By some estimates he has received more than $100 billion over that period, mainly in oil and gas subsidies.
He has taken advantage of the fact that Russia needs its small neighbour as a buffer against NATO and an export route for its oil and gas. And Putin has no desire to see another neighbouring leader toppled by demonstrators, as happened with the 'Maidan' protests in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in 2014.
Putin ""has to support him, because if he doesn't, this regime will collapse,"" said political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin. 
""For the Kremlin this is a very dangerous example of what could be used in Russia,"" he added. ""People will see that it's possible to change leaders with mass protests.""
For that reason, the fates of the two presidents are bound together, analysts said.
Although Lukashenko would have wanted more funds from Moscow, both he and Putin got something important from Monday's encounter, said Ryhor Astapenia of London's Chatham House think-tank.

""Lukashenko is saved, economically speaking, for at least some time,"" he said. ""And Putin feels sure that Russian influence will increase in Belarus.""

The rebranded welfare proposal was aimed at boosting popular support needed for a re-election bid in 2022, but Bolsonaro was unable to agree on funding with Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, who is battling to control Brazil's budget deficit.
""It is forbidden to talk about Renda Brasil in my government until 2022. We will continue with Bolsa Familia and that's it,"" the president said in a video posted on his social media accounts.
Bolsonaro pledged never to cut welfare payments for retirees or disabled people, a measure proposed by Guedes' team as a way of funding the new Renda Brasil program.
Bolsa Familia, the successful flagship safety-net program of former Workers Party President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, will be kept in place for now, Bolsonaro said.
Disagreement with Guedes on the funding of Renda Brasil meant that the plan floated by Bolsonaro was not included in the 2021 budget proposal sent to Congress last month.
Separate emergency payments made to supplement lost income of poor families and informal sector workers during the coronavirus pandemic have helped raise Bolsonaro's popularity to its highest level since he took office last year, especially in the less developed northeast of Brazil, long a leftist stronghold.
Bolsonaro has extended the payments until the end of the year but had to cut them to 300 reais a month from 600 reais due to fiscal concerns raised by Guedes.
The president had hoped to roll out Renda Brasil as a way of maintaining support to those currently receiving the emergency pandemic payments. 
But Congress was expected to back Guedes in stopping Bolsonaro from spending on new social programs.

""Bolsonaro realized that it would be difficult to find fiscal resources for Renda Brasil and it would be hard to get it approved,"" said Congressman Marcelo Ramos of the Liberal Party.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A fire erupted in a landmark building in Beirut's commercial district on Tuesday, the second blaze this month to send shudders through a capital still in shock after a massive port blast in August ripped through the Mediterranean city.
There were no immediate reports of casualties and the blaze was quickly extinguished, but it left residents exasperated in a nation that has been hammered by a deep economic crisis and which is waiting for its politicians to form a new government.
""It's terrible. It's unbelievable,"" said Joe Sayegh, 48, who had been on a jog through the city before coming to the scene. ""Every day we have a problem.""
Fire trucks quickly doused the flames that charred a corner of the futuristic building designed by the practice set up by the late Zaha Hadid, the renowned British-Iraqi architect.
The building near the seafront and its curved lines have become a prominent feature of the central commercial area rebuilt after the 1975-1990 civil war.
Solidere, the company set up to reconstruct Beirut, said initial findings indicated the fire in the building, which has been under construction for years, was caused by an accident.
During rebuilding of Lebanon's capital, skyscrapers designed by international architects have gone up and historical Ottoman-era buildings have been renovated.
But protests during an economic crisis that was caused by a mountain of debt had already driven many businesses out of the city centre and left many buildings scarred even before the Aug. 4 port blast ruined another swathe of the capital.
The government resigned after the port blast, which was blamed on highly explosive ammonium nitrate kept in poor storage conditions for years. This month, a big port fire flared up among the ruined warehouses, adding to the devastation.
France is pressing Lebanon to form a new government to tackle endemic corruption and implement reforms to unlock aid. But many Lebanese remain sceptical the country's political elite can chart a new course.

""With these people, if they are the same people, nothing will change,"" Sayegh said.

NOVI YARYLOVYCHI, Ukraine (Reuters) - Hundreds of Hasidic Jews who set off on a pilgrimage to Ukraine despite coronavirus restrictions were stuck at a border crossing on Tuesday after Belarusian border guards let them through and those in Ukraine would not let them in.
Wearing traditional dress and carrying suitcases, the pilgrims, who included children, stood and sat along the highway in the neutral zone between parked trucks.
""I spent the night on the bus, but most of them spent the night right on the road, some gathered branches in the forest and lit fires,"" one pilgrim, who gave only his first name, Benjamin, said by phone from the restricted zone on Tuesday morning. ""We have no food or water.""
The guards said they had been forced to stop traffic on Monday night on the crossing at Novi Yarylovychi between Belarus and northern Ukraine because the pilgrims were in the way.
By early afternoon on Tuesday some three dozen waiting trucks had moved through and more than a hundred police and national guardsmen were setting up tents for the night.
""The situation is under control,"" Ukrainian border guard official Oleksander Pavlik told reporters, adding that the pilgrims had been given food and water.
Every Jewish New Year, tens of thousands of Hasidic Jews make the pilgrimage to the central Ukrainian town of Uman to visit the grave of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, who revived the Hasidic movement and died in 1810. 
This year, Jewish New Year celebrations run from Sept 18-20.
NO EXCLUSION FOR PILGRIMS
Ukraine, which has recorded high numbers of new coronavirus cases in recent weeks, imposed a ban on the entry of foreigners on August 26 to September 28 due to the epidemic.
It said the ban was partly in response to a plea from Israel, where many of the pilgrims come from, to limit the event, for fear it would be a coronavirus hotspot.
""I don't know who promised to whom the passage of 3,000 citizens,"" the head of Ukraine's border service Serhiy Deineko told the group on the border. ""You were deceived.""
The Belarusian border guard service said there were 734 people in the group, including 40 children under 12. Benjamin said they had been promised by Belarusian and Ukrainian officials they would be allowed to enter Ukraine.
Pilgrims are not among exceptions to Ukraine's ban on movement and its foreign ministry urged all travelers to respect the rules to avoid difficulties at checkpoints.
It also asked the Belarusian side not to register people to cross who are not allowed into Ukraine.
BelTa state agency quoted Belarusian authorities said they allowed returning pilgrims back and said numbers were growing.
""All of them... are awaiting a decision on admission by Ukrainian side,"" it said. ""As of the morning of September 15, the work of the Ukrainian checkpoint... has not been resumed.""
The Ukrainian authorities said Belarus had allowed 200 more pilgrims into the border area since Tuesday morning.
The Rabbi Nachman Foundation issued a statement saying it had asked Ukrainian officials to allow the pilgrims to come.

""Therefore, in this situation, we ask you to make an exception and let them into Ukraine.""

ATHENS/ANKARA (Reuters) - Greece said on Tuesday it was ready for talks with Turkey over contested Mediterranean waters if Ankara continues ""disengaging itself"" from the crisis, following the withdrawal of a Turkish exploration vessel from a disputed region.
The long-running dispute between the two NATO members flared last month when Turkey sent a ship, the Oruc Reis, to survey waters claimed by Greece. Greek and Turkish warships shadowing the boat collided, highlighting the potential for military escalation. The European Union said Ankara could face sanctions.
On Sunday, less than two weeks before EU leaders discuss the crisis, the Oruc Reis returned to port. Turkey said it would resume work after regular maintenance, but a senior Turkish official said it could stay longer to give diplomacy a chance.
""Turkey still has time - ahead of and after the (EU) summit - to continue the first encouraging step of disengaging itself from this crisis,"" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said after talks with EU Council President Charles Michel in Athens.
""If we have tangible proof and this (proof) is continued, we are ready to start immediately - I stress that, immediately - exploratory talks with Turkey regarding our only major dispute: the demarcation of maritime zones"" in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean, he said.
The two countries had been on the verge of resuming talks last month, following mediation by Germany, but Turkey broke off contact after Greece and Egypt signed a deal which Ankara said violated its own claims.
Germany, which currently holds the EU presidency, has continued its diplomatic efforts, according to the Turkish official who spoke on condition of anonymity, and Turkey wanted to give those efforts a chance of success.
Maintenance work on the Oruc Reis could be finished in a week, allowing it to return to the disputed area, ""but it can remain docked longer to reduce tensions in the region and allow for diplomacy"", the official said.
He said Turkey wanted to give an opportunity for EU foreign ministers, who meet on Monday, ahead of the Sept 24-25 leaders' summit, to take steps toward easing the crisis.
""Greek officials have also made statements softening the atmosphere. These are positive. We need to take steps forward for the solution of the problem now, without... pre-conditions.""
Greek and Turkish military officials were holding separate ""de-confliction"" talks at NATO headquarters on Tuesday. The meeting was one of a series of contacts aimed at preventing any incident at sea spilling over into open conflict, but was not expected to address the actual disputes. 

Despite calling Oruc Reis back to port, Turkey still has a drilling ship and a seismic survey vessel operating in waters claimed by Cyprus, which is demanding EU sanctions on Ankara.

MEMPHIS, Egypt (Reuters) - Egypt is building two highways across the pyramids plateau outside Cairo, reviving and expanding a project that was suspended in the 1990s after an international outcry.
The Great Pyramids, Egypt's top tourist destination, are the sole survivor of the seven wonders of the ancient world and the plateau is a UNESCO world heritage site.
The highways are part of an infrastructure push spearheaded by Egypt's powerful military and championed by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is building a new capital city to ease the population pressure on Cairo, home to 20 million people.
The northern highway will cross the desert 2.5 km (1.6 miles) south of the Great Pyramids. The southern one will pass between the Step Pyramid of Saqqara - the oldest one - and the Dahshur area, home to the Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid.
Each highway appears to be about eight lanes wide.
Critics say they could cause irrevocable damage to one of the world's most important heritage sites. Authorities say they will be built with care and improve transport links, connecting new urban developments and bypassing central Cairo's congestion.
""The roads are very, very important for development, for Egyptians, for inside Egypt,"" said Mostafa al-Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. ""Know that we take good care of our antiquities sites everywhere in Egypt.""
Some Egyptologists and conservationists say the highways will disrupt the integrity of the pyramids plateau, pave over unexplored archaeological sites, generate pollution that could corrode monuments, produce litter and expose closed areas packed with hidden archaeological treasures to looting.
Al-Waziri said existing roads were much closer to the pyramids and carried a lot of tourist buses. ""That is why we are doing a lot of development,"" he said, noting plans to use electric tourist buses within the plateau to avoid pollution.
MEMPHIS
The highways, which will dissect the plateau into three, will cross a section of ancient Memphis, one of the world's biggest and most influential cities for almost 3,000 years.
""I was flabbergasted by what I saw,"" said former senior UNESCO official Said Zulficar, who visited a portion of the southern highway two months ago. ""All the work that I had done nearly 25 years ago is now being put into question.""
Zulficar led a successful campaign in the mid 1990s to suspend construction of the northern highway, a branch of Cairo's first ringroad. UNESCO said it had requested detailed information on the new plan several times and asked to send a monitoring mission.
The state press centre referred a Reuters request for further comment on the plans to a communications advisor of the tourism and antiquities ministry, who could not be reached.
Construction began well over a year ago in desert areas largely out of public sight and became more visible around March, Egyptologists and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Earth images indicate.
On a recent visit, Reuters journalists saw heavy machinery clearing fields and building bridges and junctions along both highways. Hundreds of uprooted date palms lay in piles. 
The southern highway is a part of Cairo's second ringroad that will connect the western satellite city of Sixth of October to the new capital city east of Cairo via 16 km of desert on the pyramids plateau, farmland and a corner of Memphis.
In 2014, the World Bank estimated congestion in the greater Cairo area cut about 3.6 percentage points off Egypt’s output.
""The road cuts through archaeologically unexplored cemeteries of the little-known 13th Dynasty, in walking distance of the pyramids of Pepi II and Khendjer and the Mastabat el-Fara'un"", said an Egyptologist who knows the area.
The person was among six Egyptologists Reuters spoke to. Most of them declined to be named for fear of losing clearance to handle antiquities.
One said caches of statues and blocks with hieroglyphs had been unearthed since highway construction began; the antiquities authority said on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page these had been discovered on nearby private property.
Memphis, said to have been founded in about 3,000 B.C. when Egypt was united into a single country, was eclipsed but not abandoned when Alexander the Great moved the capital to Alexandria in 331 B.C. 
It extended more than 6 square kilometres, the Nile valley's largest ancient settlement site.
The new road comes close to the ancient city's commercial districts, its harbour walls and the former site of an ancient Nilometer, used to measure the height of the annual flood, said David Jeffreys, a British Egyptologist who has been working on Memphis for the Egypt Exploration Society since 1981. 
It also endangers a Roman wall that once bordered the Nile that Jeffreys said few people were aware of.

""Memphis has long been neglected, even by Egyptologists, as it is a complicated site to excavate,"" another Egyptologist said. ""But it is enormously rich, bursting with temples, archives, administrative buildings and industrial areas.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Dozens of Western countries called on Tuesday for the release of women activists detained in Saudi Arabia and for those behind the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi to be brought to justice.
At least a dozen prominent women's rights activists were arrested in Saudi Arabia in 2018 as it lifted a ban on women driving cars, a step that many of the detainees had long campaigned for. 
Germany, speaking on behalf of the European Union at the United Nations Human Rights Council, decried Saudi Arabia's ""prolonged detentions of women rights defenders"", including Loujain al-Hathloul.
Several of the arrested women say they have suffered torture and sexual assault in detention, accusations which Saudi officials reject.
""We stress the need for full accountability and transparent prosecution of those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi,"" added Germany's ambassador, Michael Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg.
A Saudi court this month jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years for the murder of the journalist in 2018 at its consulate in Istanbul. The trial drew criticism from a U.N. investigator and from human rights campaigners who said the masterminds of the murder remained free. [nL8N2G4395]
Denmark's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Morten Jespersen, read out a joint statement on behalf of 29 countries -- including Australia, Britain and Canada -- urging the kingdom to ""release all political detainees"" and voicing concern at the detention of ""at least five women activists"".
They include al-Hathloul, Nouf Abdelaziz, Samar Badawi, Nassima Al-Sadah, Mohammed Al-Bajadi, and Miyaa Al-Zahrani, the International Service for Human Rights (ISHR) said in a statement. 
John Fisher of Human Rights Watch denounced Saudi Arabia's ""brutal targeting of defenders and dissidents"" and urged the release of the women activists and ""others arbitrarily detained"".

The Hirak popular protest movement brought thousands of Algerians to the streets for weekly demonstrations, which continued even after Bouteflika quit and a new president was elected in December.
A judicial source and a rights group that defends detainees said the appeals court had upheld the conviction of journalist Khaled Drareni on charges which include threatening national unity and ""inciting unarmed gatherings"".
His sentence was reduced to two years from a three-year term imposed by a lower court last month.
The mass demonstrations in Algeria lasted more than a year until they were finally halted in March by a coronavirus lockdown. Some campaigners say they plan to return to the streets once the lockdown is lifted.
They demand the military-backed ruling elite give way to a new generation of leadership. 
Drareni has been in detention since his arrest in March after he attended demonstrations.
The court in Algiers also confirmed four-month prison sentences against two other activists in the protest movement, Samir Benlarbi and Slimane Hamitouche, for inciting unarmed gatherings, the source and the National Committee for the Release of Detainees said.
""These harsh sentences underline the broader crackdown on freedoms in the country, and confirm an alarming pattern of prosecutions targeting journalists and activists who called for more democracy and respect for the rule of law in Algeria,"" rights watchdog Amnesty International said in a statement.

EL ESPINAR, Spain (Reuters) - A wedding ring worn by her father 84 years ago when he was shot dead by General Francisco Franco's fascist forces finally gave certainty to Rosa Maria Insua, who received it, tears in her eyes, last week at the site of a mass grave found near Madrid.
The discovery of the ring by the Historic Memory Recovery Association (ARMH) confirmed the resting place of Eugenio Juan Insua, which his family had tried to find out for decades in vain. 
More than 110,000 people are still considered missing since the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War and Franco's dictatorship that ended in 1975, which remain divisive subjects in Spain.
The left-wing coalition government on Tuesday approved a draft 'democratic memory' bill that envisages state-funded exhumation of the bodies of victims of war and the dictatorship, with the aim to help families like Insua's to bury them alongside their loved ones or claim state pensions.
""What a joy, we always thought he was here, but this gives us a lot of certainty,"" the 84-year-old said, thanking ARMH researchers who found the ring with her parents' 1931 wedding date - 1-6-931 - engraved on the inside in a mass grave in El Espinar, 65 km northwest of Madrid.
""I've been rather frail lately. Years are going by and I'd be very happy for this all to be solved, to be over, in peace,"" she told Reuters.
Eugenio Juan Insua was killed in July 1936 at the age of 29 in an ambush along with 16 other defenders of the Republican government, just days after the war broke out.
""I hope he will be genetically identified so that the family can bury him where they want and not where the murderers decided to in 1936,"" said ARMH deputy head Marco Gonzalez.
The association's president Emilio Silva said there was much work to be done yet across Spain: ""We are talking about a drop in the ocean. There are 114,226 people missing and we are an association that is trying to resolve a small part of this problem without any public help"". 
The government has already taken a series of steps to remove dictatorship-era symbols, including last year removing Franco's remains from a massive mausoleum near Madrid. 

But the recent rise of the far right such as the party VOX, already the third-largest force in parliament, makes Insua ""scared that there could be an election after which they'll say 'that's it, we don't do this (mass grave search) anymore'"".

(Reuters) - A surge in people buying guns since the coronavirus pandemic began has flooded the FBI's background check system, causing a spike in the number of delayed checks and allowing gun sales to proceed without them, FBI data disclosed on Tuesday showed. 
Gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety obtained FBI data through a Freedom of Information Act request. 
There has been a 54% increase in the number of background checks that were delayed past three days in the March through July period, as compared with the same time last year, the data shows. 
More than 5% of the 5.86 million background checks conducted during those months this year were delayed past three business days, it showed. 
More Americans are trying to buy guns than ever, according to FBI data. The bureau conducted 93% more background checks in that March through July period this year as compared with the same period the previous year, when it conducted 3.03 million checks. 
Background checks may have become more difficult to complete as state law enforcement and other government agencies housing records may have been closed or slower in replying to FBI requests because of the pandemic's impact on staffing, said Rob Wilcox, deputy director of policy at Everytown. 
If an FBI background check takes longer than three business days, a gun dealer can sell the firearm to a buyer, under current regulations.
That worries groups like Everytown because it means thousands of people prohibited by law from owning guns - such as most convicted felons - may have obtained them as the FBI background check was delayed. 
""They should have allocated the people and resources needed to conduct these background checks,"" said Wilcox. 
The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When asked in April about the spike in background checks caused by increased gun sales, the FBI said its system was ""operational and will continue to process requests.""

U.S. gun sales have soared this year, sparked by fears of social unrest because of the pandemic, violence seen on the streets of American cities during protests for racial justice, and the turbulence over the presidential election.

But the junta pushed through a charter on Saturday that says the interim president can be a soldier or a civilian and has not yet indicated when the new government would be named.
Regional presidents met junta leaders on Tuesday in Ghana in an attempt to quicken the transition. 
""Today is supposed to be the day that the junta is to put in place a government, which should respond to the criteria we set out in August. That has not been met,"" said Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo, the acting ECOWAS chair, before the start of talks.
Regional leaders fear the coup could set a dangerous precedent in West Africa and undermine a fight in Mali and neighboring countries in the Sahel region against Islamist militants with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State. 
""That country can no longer afford any delay in putting a responsible government in place,"" he said. 
West African leaders have not said what the consequences would be for failing to meet the deadline. The existing sanctions include border closures and the suspension of financial flows. 

The charter approved at multi-party talks in Mali also calls for an 18-month transition, while ECOWAS had said that fresh elections should be held within a year.

Charlie Elphicke, 49, whose wife Natalie succeeded him last year as the Member of Parliament for Dover (NYSE:DOV) in southern England, was convicted in July of assaulting his first victim, his children's nanny, in 2007 and the second, a researcher, in 2016.
""You are a sexual predator who used your success and respectability as a cover,"" the judge Philippa Whipple said, adding that he had told a pack of lies to the jury, his wife, his party's officials and the police.
""You suggested to each woman that this was something they wanted, that they had encouraged, that they had enjoyed. That was not true. They had not encouraged you or led you on. Your behavior was also an abuse of power."" 
She jailed him for two years, saying he would serve up to half behind bars, and he was ordered to pay 35,000 pounds ($45,160) costs.
Southwark Crown Court was told Elphicke, who represented Dover between 2010 and 2019, became sexually suggestive, lunged at the nanny and groped her in 2007 while his wife was away. He paid her in cash to keep it secret from his wife.
Nine years later, he forcibly kissed the parliamentary worker telling her ""I am so naughty sometimes, aren’t I?"", and on another occasion sexually touched her again despite her having said she had no interest in him.
Elphicke said he did kiss the first woman but stopped when she did not reciprocate, and while he was ""besotted"" with the second woman, he said he did not touch her.
His wife, who is still the lawmaker for Dover, said her 25-year marriage was over after her husband's conviction.

A surge in cases and deaths in care homes forced the government to introduce the ban at the start of April and the current restriction lasts until the end of September.
""The national ban on visits to care homes has for many elderly and their relatives, been one of the most difficult restrictions during the pandemic,"" Health and Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren told reporters.
""The decrease in new infections across the population, the measures that have already been taken in care homes, together with new guidelines from authorities mean that the ban can be lifted.""
While many countries in Europe are seeing a rise in new cases, the number of new infections and deaths has been steady at a low level in Sweden in recent weeks.
However, the country has recorded far more deaths since the start of the outbreak - around 5,850 - in terms of its population than its Nordic neighbours. Many of the dead were residents in care homes.
Norway, with a population around half Sweden's 10.2 million, has had around 265 deaths.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's prime minister pledged on Tuesday to ensure that a major protest this weekend against his government would be peaceful but said he was concerned that outsiders might try to instigate unrest.
Prayuth Chan-ocha said he had instructed police to avoid clashes when demonstrators march on the seat of government on Saturday. He urged protesters to follow the law and prevent chaos.
Near-daily rallies since mid-July have demanded Prayuth's removal and changes to a constitution that opponents say helped keep him in power after an election last year, which the former junta leader insists was fair.
""The government will ensure the safety of people,"" Prayuth told reporters, urging the public to be ""eyes and ears"" and prevent trouble. 
Protest leaders expect tens of thousands of people to march on Government House, piling more pressure on Prayuth's military-backed administration to dissolve parliament.
The demonstrations, though largely peaceful, have revived memories of more than a decade of intermittent unrest and protracted street rallies that culminated in a 2014 coup led by Prayuth against the government of Yingluck Shinawatra. 
The upcoming march marks the anniversary of another coup in 2006 that ousted Yingluck's brother, Thaksin. 
A dozen demonstrators have been arrested and later released over the rallies.
Protest leaders have said Saturday's rally would feature discussion about reform of the monarchy, until recently a taboo topic.
The interior ministry has sent a letter to university heads telling them to stop students demanding such reforms, which ""could lead to violence"".

It referred to 1976 and 1992 incidents when security forces killed scores of anti-government demonstrators.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has doubled the budget for vital roads and bridges along the undemarcated border with China in recent years in response to Beijing's rapid infrastructure development on its side, the Indian defense minister said on Tuesday.
Troops of the two countries are locked in their most serious face-offs for years along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) or informal border in the western Himalayas, raising fears of a broader conflict.
One of the reasons for the tensions has been India's recent construction of roads and airfields near the border in the Ladakh region bordering Tibet, the Chinese side has said.
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told parliament that China had been building up its infrastructure in the remote mountains for decades and the government was trying to close the gap. 
""Our government too has stepped up the budget for border infrastructure development to about double the previous levels. As a result, more roads and bridges have been completed in the border areas,"" he said. He provided no figure.
Military officials say the development of roads and airfields on both sides of the border has also helped troops mobilize quickly in large numbers and in close proximity at some points in the Ladakh area. 
Singh said Indian and Chinese troops have had face-offs on the unsettled border in the past, but the scale of deployment of troops and the number of disputed areas was much more than the past. 
""As of now, the Chinese side has mobilized a large number of troops and armaments along the LAC as well as in the depth areas,"" he said, listing Gogra, Kongka La and the north and south banks of the Pangong lake as ""friction points.""

""In response to China’s actions, our armed forces have also made appropriate counter deployments in these areas to ensure that India’s security interests are fully protected,"" he said to thumping of desks in parliament.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Grieving South African families are being left searching for someone to collect the bodies of deceased relatives after funeral parlors like Hloni Swarts' went on strike in a country with one of the world's highest coronavirus rates. 
Swarts, owner of Hloni Funerals, told Reuters he had to tell distressed families, ""there's nothing we can do"", as the three-day strike entered its second day. He tried to help them arrange for a stretched government service to collect bodies instead, but they still complained. 
Funeral workers are striking in the country over changes to a host of procedures and regulations, including some introduced in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, that they say make it hard for small, black-owned parlors to operate and give big players an advantage. 
They want a COVID-19 relief fund to help the industry cope with the pandemic. 
""It's not a nice thing to sit with a body at home, even for more than two hours,"" Swarts said, speaking on Tuesday in a group of around 20 picketers who held up a coffin outside Johannesburg's Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital - the largest in the country.
""But imagine sitting with a body for three days at home. Imagine that, what will happen to the body,"" he said, adding he understood why clients were upset but parlors' fight was with the government, not them. 
All 1,000 members of the National Funeral Practitioners Association of South Africa (NAFUPA SA) were participating in the strike, according to its President Muzi Hlengwa, with other associations across the industry also taking part, though significant groups opted not to participate.
Hlengwa said that the strike would continue on Wednesday unless it generated some response to all demands, with a permanent strike possible in future if this does not happen. 
The Department of Health warned that the strike posed a public health risk in a country with over 650,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and around 15,500 deaths. 
The government had abandoned the industry during the pandemic, Swarts said at the Soweto picket, giving no acknowledgement to the stress it was under or funds or equipment to help it cope. 

""(I'm) very, very angry,"" he said. ""It's not a nice feeling, because we have to deal with the bodies day in, day out.""

About 100 mostly peaceful protesters gathered on Sukhbaatar Square in front of Mongolia's Government Palace and chanted ""let's protect our native language"" and ""Wang Yi go away"". 
They were responding to a policy forcing elementary and secondary schools in China's Inner Mongolia region to adhere to a national curriculum in Chinese language, politics and history.
China said the policy was designed to promote national unity and insisted there would still be room for Mongolian language teaching in other subjects and grades.
However, the policy has led to school boycotts and accusations by human rights groups that Beijing is trying to destroy Mongolian culture. 
On Monday, the U.S.-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center accused Chinese authorities of turning the region into a ""police state"".
It said 4,000-5,000 people had been put into police custody during three weeks of protests, while at least nine had lost their lives.
The Mongolian government has yet to comment on the issue.
""Our leaders need to speak up,"" one protester, a shaman named Khaliun Sukhbaatar, told Reuters. ""If our government keeps silent in the name of international relations and economic stability, one by one Mongolians are being pressed out and Mongolia will cease to exist."" 
Mongolia's economy is heavily dependent on China, and Beijing is expected to provide the country a 700 million yuan ($103.15 million) grant during Wang's two-day visit. 
In an interview with Ulaanbaatar-based Daily National Newspaper on Monday, China's ambassador to Mongolia Chai Wenrui said ""false rumors"" about the policy were provoking conflict.
He also said China's demand for Mongolian coal - its biggest export earner - was shrinking. Though shipments have continued, they were piling up because there was no market for them.
""Frankly, we are working in your interests,"" he was quoted as saying.

572,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",South Korea says no use of nuclear weapons in joint operational plans with U.S.,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Tuesday none of its joint military action plans with the United States include any use of nuclear weapons, after a book by a U.S. journalist sparked debate over whether scenarios of a full-blown war with North Korea would entail a nuclear attack from either side. 
In his new book, titled ""Rage,"" Washington Post associate editor Bob  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD) wrote that the United States had devised plans for a possible armed clash with North Korea, such as ""the U.S. response to an attack that could include the use of 80 nuclear weapons."" The book was based on multiple interviews with U.S. President Donald Trump. 
The passage fueled debate in South Korea over whether it meant Washington or Pyongyang would detonate 80 bombs against each other. 
Seoul's defense ministry said on Tuesday its joint operational plans (OPLAN) with the United States did not include any use of nuclear weapons, reiterating the view of the presidential office. 
A presidential official said on Monday there must not be another war on the peninsula and any use of force cannot be implemented without South Korea's consent. 
""I can say clearly that the use of a nuclear weapon does not exist in our OPLANs, and it is impossible to use military force without our agreement,"" the official told reporters.
Seoul officials say there appears to be confusion in the book because the OPLAN 5027 it referred to was not designed for nuclear war but to map out troop deployment plans and key targets. 
""It might indicate the maximum levels of the bombs the North could resort to in an all-out war, but the number itself is too high and hardly comprehensible in any case without clear contexts,"" said Kim Hong-kyun, a former South Korea nuclear envoy. 
After trading insults and nuclear threats that had pushed their countries to the brink of war, U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held an unprecedented summit in Singapore in 2018. 
But negotiations aimed at ending Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs have stalled since their second summit early last year. 
The two leaders continued to exchange letters, however, often expressing thanks for their previous meetings and at times calling for concessions, the book said.
In an August 2019 letter, Kim urged that South Korea-U.S. military exercises be canceled or postponed before working-level negotiation. Planned drills, which Pyongyang has called a rehearsal for war, were scaled back later on, and both sides described it as a move to expedite the talks. 
""I am clearly offended and I do not want to hide this feeling from you. I am really, very offended,"" Kim wrote, referring to the exercises. 
Trump also said during their first summit that he did not want to ""remove"" Kim, and that North Korea could become ""one of the great economic powers"" if it abandons weapons programs, the book said.

573,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 07:26AM ET</span>","As Arab Gulf starts opening to Israel, Palestinians face a reckoning","By Rami Ayyub
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's rapprochement with Gulf Arab states has left the Palestinians feeling abandoned by traditional allies and clutching an old playbook in a rapidly changing Middle East, analysts and critics say.
As the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain prepare to sign normalization accords with Israel at a White House ceremony on Tuesday, Palestinian leaders face calls to overhaul their strategy to avoid becoming marginalized in a region where Israel and most Sunni Arab regimes share a fear of Iran.
The Palestinian approach to securing freedom from Israeli occupation has for years relied on a longstanding pan-Arab position that called for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied West Bank and Gaza and Israel's acceptance of Palestinian statehood, in return for normal relations with Arab countries.
But the Palestinians last week failed to persuade the Arab League to condemn nations breaking ranks.
Tuesday's ceremony, hosted by U.S. President Donald Trump, will be ""a black day in the history of Arab nations"", Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said on Monday. 
Shtayyeh said the Palestinians are now discussing whether to ""adjust Palestine's relationship with the Arab League."" 
But critics say the proposed move is too little too late, with President Mahmoud Abbas facing mounting criticism for their increasingly isolated position.
""There is very little indication that the (Palestinian) leadership is contemplating a break from its approach,"" Tareq Baconi, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, told Reuters.
The Palestinians' strategy centers on holding Israel to account in international legal tribunals, and trying to break the United States' dominance over the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Baconi said.
""Arab and European support in that strategy is crucial, but it is questionable that the Palestinians will be able to secure either to the level required to ensure a just peace.""
TWO-STATE SOLUTION
Despite signs of shifting Arab support, Saeb Erekat, Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), said the underlying Palestinian strategy for achieving a state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza would not change.
""To stay on the grounds of international law, international legality, to seek peace based on ending Israeli occupation and a two-state solution ... we cannot depart from these squares,"" he told Reuters.
While conceding difficulties faced by a Palestinian leadership under Israeli occupation, analysts nevertheless say Abbas does have some options. 
After years of in-fighting between the two main Palestinian factions, Abbas's Fatah and Islamist Hamas, long-overdue elections would refresh the president and parliament's mandate and boost their leverage abroad by increasing their legitimacy at home, analysts say.
""We need to ... rebuild the PLO's institutions from the ground up and cement relations between Palestinians here and in the diaspora,"" Gaza analyst Talal Okal said. 
Over six million diaspora Palestinians, he said, ""can influence the communities they live in so the Palestinian cause has a place on the agendas of their host governments.""
TRUMP BOYCOTT
One area where Abbas has widespread public support - 70% in recent polls - is his two-year boycott of the Trump administration, which he accuses of pro-Israel bias over its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and endorsement of Israel's West Bank settlements. 
Frustrated by the Palestinians' refusal to take part in Trump-led talks, the White House has sought to bypass Abbas and his team, apparently hoping they will see the deals with the UAE and Bahrain as incentives to return to negotiations.
For more than two years Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has tried sidestepping Abbas to appeal to Palestinians directly, telling Al-Quds newspaper in 2018: ""The world has moved forward while you have been left behind. Don't allow your grandfather's conflict to determine your children's future.""
That has had little apparent success. And the Palestinian leadership at first engaged with the Trump administration. Until, said Erekat, they concluded that ""these people want to dictate a solution, not negotiate a solution ... they're the ones who are departing from international law.""
Dennis Ross, who served as a Middle East adviser under Republican and Democratic administrations, had cautionary words for both sides.
While the Gulf deals served notice that Palestinians ""don't have a veto on normalization as regional dynamics shift"" the Israelis, he said, ""cannot wish the Palestinians away — and standing pat also means increasing the risk of one state for two peoples.""

KARACHI (Reuters) - Millions of students in Pakistan returned to classes on Tuesday after a break of six months, as schools and colleges began to reopen for the first time since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
Educational institutes were closed in March as the coronavirus began to spread in Pakistan, but, with daily infection numbers falling, the government last week announced a staggered resumption of classes.
""May God make us successful in this test, and may the loss suffered by the students be compensated,” Minister of Education Shafqat Mahmood told reporters in Islamabad. 
Senior schools were the first to restart, with middle school set to go back next week and primary school the week after.
The long closure led to the cancellations of exams and left academic calendars in disarray. 
""Studies have been very badly affected,"" Naseem Akhtar, principal of a girls' school in the port city of Karachi, told Reuters.
""We appreciate the decision of the government to open schools from today."" 
Mahmood warned that schools that did not following precautionary measures, including the wearing of masks and social distancing, would be closed. 
""The safety of these children is in our hands,” Karachi teacher Sameera Chaudhry told Reuters.
Pakistan has recorded 302,424 cases of the coronavirus and more than 6,300 deaths but daily infections have been slowing from a peak of nearly 7,000, and 118 deaths, in one day in June.
On Monday, authorities reported 404 new cases and six deaths.
""Online classes aren't as interesting as real-life classes. In regular classes, when we don’t understand something, we can easily ask the teacher to explain,” said student Dua Mohammad Saleem.

She said she was pleased about the safety rules but some government officials were skeptical, saying younger children will not be able to follow the rules.

Visitors will be able to extend a 90-day visas that cost 2,000 baht ($64.14) two more times, deputy government spokeswoman Traisulee Traisoranakul told a cabinet briefing.
The government aims to allow foreign visitors from low-risk or no-risk countries to visit the country from next month, Yuthasak Supasorn, governor of the official Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), told Reuters. 
""I want to see this happen quickly. I will try to do it in October or the fourth quarter at the latest,"" he said.
Several hundred visitors who agreed to a 14-day quarantine will be allowed per month and ""we also want them to fly direct to reduce risks"".
The plan is to start with provinces that provide alternative state quarantine, Yuthasak said.
By sealing off the country to all but returning Thai nationals and approved foreigners, and requiring all arrivals to quarantine, Thailand has kept coronavirus cases to just 3,480, the vast majority of which have recovered. The country has reported 58 deaths.
But Thailand has previously shelved plans to reopen to foreign tourists due to concerns about new outbreaks, including an East Asia travel bubble and a proposal to designate resorts such as Phuket for holidays that include mandatory quarantine and movement restrictions.
The tourism-reliant country has recorded no foreign tourists since April when it imposed a travel ban.
The state planning agency expects only 6.7 million foreign tourists this year after last year's record 39.8 million visitors whose spending made up 11.4% of GDP.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish and international lawyers' groups have voiced concern over the arrest of dozens of lawyers, saying they had been doing their job when representing clients accused of links to the network Turkey blames for an attempted coup in 2016.
The Ankara state prosecutor's office ordered the detention of 60 people on Friday, including 48 lawyers and others in the legal sector, suspected of operating in support of the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen.
The suspects were part of a structure within the Gulenist network which sought to ""steer investigations in favor of the group under the guise of attorney activities"", the prosecutor's office said. 
The Istanbul Bar Association described the arrests as intimidation. In a statement released on Monday, it said the allegations related to the execution of their duties as lawyers, representing clients accused of Gulen links.
""A lawyer cannot be identified with their client,"" the association said. ""Intimidation which hopes to restrict the lawyers' duty ... will impact the public as much as lawyers and gradually destroy confidence in justice.""
The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) also expressed concern, saying the arrests breached Turkey's obligations under international law.
""Lawyers should never be arrested or sanctioned for representing their clients, or identified with their clients causes,"" said Roisin Pillay, Director of the ICJ Europe and Central Asia Programme.
In a crackdown since the failed coup, in which 250 people were killed, tens of thousands of people have been arrested. Gulen, a former ally of President Tayyip Erdogan, has denied involvement in the putsch.
On Tuesday, prosecutors in the western province of Izmir ordered the arrest of 66 suspects, including 48 serving military personnel, in an investigation of the armed forces, state-owned Anadolu news agency reported.

In the post-coup crackdown, more than 20,000 people had been expelled from the Turkish military.

RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - When one of Saudi Arabia's leading clerics called this month for Muslims to avoid ""passionate emotions and fiery enthusiasm"" towards Jews, it was a marked change in tone for someone who has shed tears preaching about Palestine in the past.
The sermon by Abdulrahman al-Sudais, imam of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, broadcast on Saudi state television on Sept. 5, came three weeks after the United Arab Emirates agreed a historic deal to normalise relations with Israel and days before the Gulf state of Bahrain, a close Saudi ally, followed suit.
Sudais, who in past sermons prayed for Palestinians to have victory over the ""invader and aggressor"" Jews, spoke about how the Prophet Mohammad was good to his Jewish neighbour and argued the best way to persuade Jews to convert to Islam was to ""treat them well"".
While Saudi Arabia is not expected to follow the example of its Gulf allies any time soon, Sudais' remarks could be a clue to how the kingdom approaches the sensitive subject of warming to Israel - a once inconceivable prospect. Appointed by the king, he is one of the country's most influential figures, reflecting the views of its conservative religious establishment as well as the Royal Court. 
The dramatic agreements with the UAE and Bahrain were a coup for Israel and U.S. President Donald Trump who is portraying himself as a peacemaker ahead of November elections. 
But the big diplomatic prize for an Israel deal would be Saudi Arabia, whose king is the Custodian of Islam's holiest sites, and rules the world's largest oil exporter. 
Marc Owen Jones, an academic from the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter, said the UAE and Bahrain's normalization has allowed Saudi Arabia to test public opinion, but a formal deal with Israel would be a ""large task"" for the kingdom. 
""Giving the Saudis a 'nudge' via an influential imam is obviously one step in trying to test the public reaction and to encourage the notion of normalisation,"" Jones added.
In Washington, a State Department official said the United States was encouraged by warming ties between Israel and Gulf Arab countries, viewed this trend as a positive development and ""we are engaging to build on it.""
There was no immediate response to a request by Reuters for comment from the Saudi government's media office. 
Sudais' plea to shun intense feelings is a far cry from his past when he wept dozens of times while praying for Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque - Islam's third-holiest site.
The Sept. 5 sermon drew a mixed reaction, with some Saudis defending him as simply communicating the teachings of Islam. Others on Twitter, mostly Saudis abroad and apparently critical of the government, called it ""the normalisation sermon"".
Ali al-Suliman, one of several Saudis interviewed at one of Riyadh's malls by Reuters TV, said in reaction to the Bahrain deal that normalisation with Israel by other Gulf states or in the wider Middle East was hard to get used to, as ""Israel is an occupying nation and drove Palestinians out of their homes"". 
MUTUAL FEAR OF IRAN
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de-facto ruler often referred to as MbS, has promised to promote interfaith dialogue as part of his domestic reform. The young prince previously stated that Israelis are entitled to live peacefully on their own land on condition of a peace agreement that assures stability for all sides. 
Saudi Arabia and Israel's mutual fear of Iran may be a key driver for the development of ties.
There have been other signs that Saudi Arabia, one of the most influential countries in the Middle East, is preparing its people to eventually warm to Israel. 
A period drama, ""Umm Haroun"" that aired during Ramadan in April on Saudi-controlled MBC television, a time when viewership typically spikes, centred around the trials of a Jewish midwife. 
The fictional series was about a multi-religious community in an unspecified Gulf Arab state in the 1930s to 1950s. The show drew criticism from the Palestinian Hamas group, saying it portrayed Jews in a sympathetic light. 
At the time, MBC said that the show was the top-rated Gulf drama in Saudi Arabia in Ramadan. The show's writers, both Bahraini, told Reuters it had no political message. 
But experts and diplomats said it was another indication of shifting public discourse on Israel.
Earlier this year, Mohammed al-Aissa, a former Saudi minister and the general secretary of the Muslim World League, visited Auschwitz. In June, he took part in a conference organised by the American Jewish Committee, where he called for a world without ""Islamophobia and anti-Semitism"". 
""Certainly, MbS is intent on moderating state-sanctioned messages shared by the clerical establishment and part of that will likely work towards justifying any future deal with Israel, which would have seemed unthinkable before,"" said Neil Quilliam, associate fellow with Chatham House.
ISOLATED PALESTINIANS 
Normalisation between the UAE, Bahrain and Israel, which will be signed at the White House on Tuesday, has further isolated the Palestinians.
Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, has not directly addressed Israel's deals with the UAE and Bahrain, but said it remains committed to peace on the basis of the long-standing Arab Peace Initiative. 
How, or whether, the kingdom would seek to exchange normalisation for a deal on those terms remains unclear.
That initiative offers normalised ties in return for a statehood deal with the Palestinians and full Israeli withdrawal from territories captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
However, in another eye-catching gesture of goodwill, the kingdom has allowed Israel-UAE flights to use its airspace. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who has a close relationship with MbS, praised the move last week.
A diplomat in the Gulf said that for Saudi Arabia, the issue is more related to what he called its religious position as the leader of the Muslim world, and that a formal deal with Israel would take time and is unlikely to happen while King Salman is still in power.

""Any normalisation by Saudi will open doors for Iran, Qatar and Turkey to call for internationalising the two holy mosques,"" he said, referring to periodic calls by critics of Riyadh to have Mecca and Medina placed under international supervision.

China has stepped up pressure on international bodies to exclude Taiwan, including non-governmental groups, from participating unless they accept they come from China rather than separately-governed Taiwan.
In a statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, Taiwan's Chinese Wild Bird Federation said the Cambridge-based BirdLife International had removed it as a partner organization. 
It said BirdLife's governing body had asked them to sign a document ""formally committing to not promote or advocate the legitimacy of the Republic of China or the independence of Taiwan from China"". 
The Republic of China is Taiwan's formal name. 
""As an apolitical organization which has never taken a stance on any such issue, we felt it was inappropriate to sign such a document and were unable to comply. We are not political actors, we are conservationists.""
The group said BirdLife asked them to change their name, and that even if they did this and signed the political documents they may still be removed as a ""risk"".
While the matter was due to be discussed at BirdLife's general assembly, its governing global body decided the Taiwan federation had not addressed these risks and voted to remove it as a partner body, the group added.
""We at the CWBF are no risk. What we are is a strong and effective partner in global conservation with a proven track-record,"" it said. ""Birds don't know borders!""
BirdLife, whose honorary president is Japan's Princess Takamado, did not respond to an emailed request for comment nor answer several calls to its main British office.
BirdLife lists only one Chinese partner on its website, a group based in Hong Kong.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany wants to take in about 1,500 migrants stranded on Greek islands after a fire destroyed an overcrowded camp, government sources said on Tuesday, in a gesture of solidarity with its fellow European Union member state.
The decision by Chancellor Angela Merkei follows a rise in opinion polls by her conservative party, at the expense of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, after what is widely seen as her steady handling of the coronavirus crisis.
More than 12,000 people, mostly asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Africa and Syria, were left without shelter, proper sanitation or access to food after a fire destroyed the Moria migrant camp on the island of Lesbos last week.
The German government sources told Reuters that Germany would house migrants whose asylum applications have already been accepted and had been on Lesbos.
An interior ministry spokesman said a proposal had been made which conservative members of parliament would discuss later on Tuesday. 
Greece has long been burdened by the number of migrants arriving by sea, and there are around 30,000 refugees and migrants on the Greek islands.
The issue of migration continues to divide the EU, which has failed to craft a common asylum policy five years after Merkel opened Germany's doors to 1.2 million people seeking protection.
The AfD entered German parliament for the first time two years later, and is the main opposition party.
The 1,500 migrants to be brought to Germany from Greece are in addition to 100-150 children that Merkel's government wants to take in.

Polls show a majority of Germans favour welcoming migrants who need protection, and she and Interior Minister Horst Seehofer have faced calls from regional and local politicians to ease the burden on Greece by taking in migrants.

President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded international efforts to set Lebanon on a new course after decades of corrupt rule led to its deepest crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.
But unlike Washington, which deems the heavily armed and politically powerful movement a terrorist group, Paris says its elected arm has a legitimate political role.
The United States last week expanded its sanctions related to Lebanon by blacklisting two former government ministers it accused of enabling Hezbollah. That has raised questions as to how much the U.S. and France are coordinating as Lebanon's factional rivalries struggle to form a new government. 
""The United States has assumed its responsibility and we will stop Iran buying Chinese tanks and Russian air defense systems and then selling weapons to Hezbollah (and) torpedoing President Macron's efforts in Lebanon,"" Pompeo told France Inter radio.
""You can't allow Iran to have more money, power and arms and at same time try to disconnect Hezbollah from the disasters it provoked in Lebanon.""
Hezbollah, which has a parliamentary majority, and its Shi’ite ally Amal held ministerial posts in the last government, including the health and finance ministries. 
Macron said on Sept. 1, during a visit a month after a devastating Beirut port blast, that Lebanese politicians agreed to form a cabinet by Sept. 15, an ambitious timeline given it usually takes months.
French officials have said the priority is to put in place a government that could implement reforms quickly, but the matter of Hezbollah's weapons was not an immediate issue.
French daily newspaper Le Figaro reported in August that Macron had met Mohammed Raad, the head of Hezbollah's parliamentary bloc, and told him that the group should disassociate itself from Iran and remove its forces from neighboring Syria.
The French presidency did not deny the meeting, which would be a first between a French leader and a member of the group.

""It's a doubled-edged sword for Macron. Hezbollah is part of the very governance system that needs changing and I'm not sure you can deal with political Hezbollah without handling armed Hezbollah,"" said a French diplomatic source.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Nearly two dozen activist groups said on Tuesday that crimes against humanity and genocide are taking place against Uighurs in China's remote Xinjiang region, where more than 1 million people are held in camps.
There was no immediate response to the allegations by the Chinese foreign ministry, contacted by Reuters. China says the camps are vocational education and training centres as part of counter-terrorism and deradicalisation measures.
The open letter signed by groups including the U.S.-based Uighur Human Rights Project and Genocide Watch calls on the United Nations Human Rights Council to launch an investigation.
""The atrocities include arbitrary detention of between 1 and 1.8 million people in internment camps, a widespread program of political indoctrination, enforced disappearances, destruction of cultural sites, forced labour, disproportionate rates of prison incarceration, and coercive birth prevention campaigns and policies,"" it said.
Under international law, crimes against humanity are defined as widespread and systematic, whereas the burden of proof of genocide - the intent to destroy part of a population - is more difficult to prove.
""These measures meet the threshold of acts constitutive of genocide, core international crimes under the Genocide Convention, which prohibits 'imposing measures intended to prevent births' among an ethnic or religious group,"" the groups said.
U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on Monday she was discussing a possible visit to Xinjiang with Chinese authorities who are facing growing backlash over the treatment of ethnic Uighurs. [G8N2D200T]
But activists voiced disappointment in her speech to the Human Rights Council, where China has never been the object of a resolution.
""Bachelet's remarks on China say nothing of substance - no word about the human costs of China's rights violations, including against Uighurs and in Hong Kong, nor the ongoing concerns about free expression, arbitrary detention and crackdowns on civil society,"" Sarah Brooks of the International Service for Human Rights told Reuters.
""Instead, the remarks speak volumes about the weak position of the human rights office vis-a-vis China,"" she said. 
The U.S. on Monday shelved plans for a broad import ban on cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang while announcing narrower bans on products from five specific entities.

U.S. officials said the measures were aimed at combating China's use of forced labour by detained Uighur Muslims.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Five-year-old Kenyan student Miguel Munene sits between his parents, holding their hands as he watches cartoon characters teaching him to pronounce ""fish"".
The television has replaced Munene's teachers and classmates after the government shut schools indefinitely in March to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. They are closed until at least January. 
Many children don't have the option to learn online - the United Nations children's agency UNICEF says at least half of sub-Saharan Africa's schoolchildren do not have internet access. 
So some, like Munene, watch a cartoon made by Tanzanian non-profit organisation Ubongo, which offers television and radio content for free to African broadcasters.
“Other programmes are just for fun, but Ubongo is helping children,"" Miguel’s mother Celestine Wanjiru told Reuters. “He can now differentiate a lot of shapes and colours, both in English and Swahili.”
In March, programmes by Ubongo - the Kiswahili word for brain - were broadcast to an area covering about 12 million households in nine countries, said Iman Lipumba, Ubongo's head of communications. That rose to 17 million in 20 countries by August.
""The COVID-19 pandemic has really forced us to rapidly grow,"" Lipumba said. 
A group of artists, innovators and educators set up Ubongo TV in Tanzania in 2014. It has received around $4 million in grants since, and earned $700,000 from YouTube, product sales, character licensing, and co-production of programmes.
For Munene and other schoolchildren, programmes like Ubongo's are their only option to learn for now. 
Kenya's education ministry says schools can only reopen when the number of COVID-19 cases drops substantially. 
Kenya has had over 36,000 confirmed cases and more than 620 deaths, health ministry data showed.
“You have the kid with you all the time so when you have such programmes, they are a big help,” Patrick Nyaga, Miguel’s father, a security guard, told Reuters.
But television cannot completely replace teaching. 

“The way the children learn through programmes is different (from) the way they interact with others and teachers,” Nyaga said. ""We are hoping that they open soon.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia will increase maritime security operations near some of its islands in the South China Sea after a Chinese coastguard vessel was spotted nearby, raising suspicions about its intentions, a senior security official said on Tuesday. 
The vessel entered Indonesia's 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the northern Natuna islands on Saturday and left on Monday after radio challenges over jurisdiction, Aan Kurnia, chief of the maritime security agency, Bakamla, told Reuters. 
Under international law, innocent passage is permitted through another country's EEZ, but Aan said the vessel was lingering too long. 
""Because this one floated, then went circling, we became suspicious, we approached it and learned that it was a Chinese coastguard vessel,"" he said, adding the navy and coastguard would boost operations there.
Wang Wenbin, China's foreign ministry spokesman, said the ship was undertaking ""normal patrol duties in waters under Chinese jurisdiction"". 
""China's rights and interests in the relevant waters in the South China Sea are clear,"" Wang told a news conference.
Indonesia renamed the northern reaches of its EEZ in 2017 as the North Natuna Sea, pushing back against China's maritime territorial ambitions.
While China has made no claim to islands, the presence of its coastguard nearly 2,000 km (1,243 miles) off its mainland has concerned Indonesia, after numerous encounters between Chinese vessels in the EEZs of Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, which disrupted fishing and energy activities.
A weeks-long standoff occurred 10 months ago when a Chinese coastguard vessel and accompanying fishing boats entered the northern Natuna Sea, prompting Indonesia to send fighter jets and mobilise its own fishermen.
China's coastguard often operates alongside fishing boats described by experts as state-backed militia.
The ""nine-dash line"" on Chinese maps denoting its vast maritime claims includes waters off the Natuna islands. An international arbitration panel in 2016 invalidated that line. 

Indonesia's foreign ministry spokesman Teuku Faizasyah reiterated that Jakarta does not recognise the line.

587,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 04:56AM ET</span>",Two dozen Hong Kong activists appear in court over banned Tiananmen vigil,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Two dozen Hong Kong pro-democracy activists appeared in court on Tuesday to hear charges of participating in an illegal assembly over a June 4 vigil commemorating the crackdown on protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
It was the first time the vigil had been banned in semiautonomous Hong Kong, with police citing coronavirus restrictions on group gatherings as the reason for not granting permission.
Still, tens of thousands of people lit candles across the city in what was largely a peaceful event, bar a brief skirmish with riot police in one neighbourhood.
""We insist that condemning the Tiananmen massacre is no crime,"" said Lee Cheuk-yan, who organises the annual vigil in Hong Kong and is among those facing charges, before entering the court. ""We will continue the struggle.""
The 26 activists facing charges included Joshua Wong, media tycoon Jimmy Lai and Nathan Law, who left Hong Kong after China imposed a sweeping national security law on the Asian financial hub in June. 
Another activist, Sunny Cheung, who planned to run in a since-postponed election for the city's legislature, was also absent. Cheung has been the subject of speculation he may have also fled Hong Kong. Prosecutors said he has not been in the city since Aug. 14, according to immigration authorities.
The June 4 anniversary struck an especially sensitive nerve in the former British colony this year, falling just as Beijing prepared to introduce the new security legislation, which punishes anything China sees as subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Pro-democracy activists see the new legislation as the latest attempt by Beijing to encroach on Hong Kong's freedoms. Its supporters say the law will bring stability after a year of unrest.
June 4 commemorations are banned in mainland China, but Hong Kong traditionally held the largest vigils globally every year, having been promised certain freedoms when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, including rights of expression and assembly.

China has never provided a full account of the 1989 violence. The death toll given by officials days later was about 300, most of them soldiers, but rights groups and witnesses say thousands of people may have died.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The 12 Hong Kong people arrested at sea by mainland authorities were not ""democratic activists being oppressed"", the city's leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday, with 10 of them on bail for offences in the Asian financial hub.
The 12 were arrested on Aug. 23 for illegal entry into mainland China after setting off from Hong Kong in a boat bound for self-ruled Taiwan, amid a crackdown by Beijing on pro-democracy activists in the former British colony.
Hong Kong's Security Bureau said on Monday all 12 were suspected of committing crimes in Hong Kong.
Ten of them had been charged with offences such as manufacturing or possessing explosives, arson, rioting, assaulting police or possession of offensive weapons. Those 10 had been on bail and not allowed to leave Hong Kong, it said.
One was suspected of colluding with foreign forces under a national security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in June. The law allows for the punishment of anything China considers to be subversion, separatism, terrorism or such collusion.
Speaking at her regular weekly news conference, Lam reiterated that the 12 will have to face justice in the mainland and that her government will provide them and their families with the ""needed and feasible"" assistance.
""The reason for them leaving Hong Kong seems to be that they were running away from legal responsibility,"" Lam said.
""I want to set the record straight, because certain local and overseas individuals tried to shift the attention, describing them as democratic (activists) being oppressed.""
Lam's comments come after relatives of some of the detainees held a news conference on Saturday to demand their urgent return and plead for them to be allowed to call home and consult lawyers appointed by the families and not the Chinese government.
Hours before the families' appearance, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was deeply concerned about the activists, noting they had been denied access to lawyers.
China's foreign ministry on Sunday labelled the group ""separatists"". Police in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, where they are being held, said on Sunday they were suspected of illegal entry, its first public notice on the matter.

Asked about whether it was appropriate label them as ""separatists"" given they are yet to face trial, Lam said she saw ""no particular value"" in debating the issue.

LONDON (Reuters) - British minister Priti Patel said on Tuesday she would call the police to report anyone who flouted a new ban on gatherings of more than six people, suggesting that people who stopped for a chat on the street were breaking new coronavirus laws.
COVID-19 cases across the UK have risen sharply in recent weeks, prompting the government to bring in the new rules to restrict socialising, at the same time as health bosses have said there are problems with accessing tests. 
Patel said that people needed to help stop the spread of the disease, and that included calling the police on neighbours. She even suggested that families should not mingle with friends they bumped into on the street. 
""If I saw something that I thought was inappropriate, then quite frankly I would effectively call the police,"" she told Sky News. 
""It's not about dobbing in neighbours, I think it's all about us taking personal responsibility. If there was a big party taking place, it would be right to call the police.""
Asked to define ""mingling"" - also not allowed under the new rules - she said it was ""people coming together"" and that if two families of four stopped for a chat in the street they would be infringing the law.
""It is mingling, I think it's absolutely mingling,"" she told BBC radio.
The social clampdown comes amid concern that people are struggling to get tests for COVID-19, especially in areas where the infection rates are highest. 
Patel said that tests were available for people in their local areas, and that Public Health England was adding capacity and ensuring more testing was available on a daily basis. 
""The majority of tests are available within a 10-mile (16-km) radius,"" she told BBC TV, although she conceded that in some extreme cases people wouldn't be able to get a test within that radius.

UK media reported many examples of people in virus hotspots unable to get tests, while NHS Providers, a body representing hospital, community and ambulance services in the state-run health service, said on Twitter that current testing shortages were starting to impact health services.

Pope Francis has signed off on a two-year extension of the agreement that critics have condemned as a sell-out to the communist government, a senior Vatican source said on Monday.
The Vatican is Chinese-claimed Taiwan's sole European diplomatic ally and the government has watched with concern as the Pope has moved to improve relations with China. Taiwan has formal ties with only 15 countries, largely due to Chinese pressure.
Taiwan was playing close attention to the Vatican's interactions with China and was in close touch it, Taiwan foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said, adding that Taiwan and the Vatican had ""smooth"" communications.
""Our side has continued to receive assurances from the Vatican, that the bishops agreement with China is religious, not about diplomatic relations, and asked us not to worry,"" Ou told reporters.
Taiwan hoped the agreement can help improve religious freedom in China, but since it was signed two years ago repression had actually worsened, with believers jailed and churches torn down, Ou said.
China's constitution guarantees religious freedom, but in recent years the government has tightened restrictions on religions seen as a challenge to the authority of the ruling Communist Party.
Critics say this has made the deal a farce. The Vatican says no deal would have risked causing a schism in the Church in China.
The two-year provisional deal, which gives the pope the final say on the appointment of bishops, took effect on Oct. 22, 2018 and, if the Chinese side agrees, which is seen as virtually a given, it will be extended without any changes, the Vatican source said. 

Catholics in China are split between a state-backed ""official"" Church and a ""non-official"" underground Church that remains loyal to Rome. Both sides now recognise the pope as supreme leader of the Catholic Church.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese ruling party head Yoshihide Suga, in line to become the next prime minister, appeared set on Tuesday to continue his predecessor's policies by keeping key cabinet ministers and party officials in their posts, as he had promised.
Suga, long a loyal aide and chief cabinet secretary under outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, on Monday won a landslide victory to take over the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). He pledged to carry on many of Abe's programmes, including his signature ""Abenomics"" economic strategy.
He faces a vast array of challenges, including tackling COVID-19 while reviving a battered economy and dealing with a rapidly aging society in which nearly a third of the population is older than 65.
Finance Minister Taro Aso and Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi are likely to stay in their positions, according to multiple media reports. Yasutoshi Nishimura is likely to be reappointed as economy minister. 
Defence Minister Taro Kono is seen becoming interior minister and Nobuo Kishi, an LDP lawmaker who is Abe's younger brother, will take up the defence portfolio, Kyodo news agency said.
Toshihiro Nikai, who was instrumental in helping Suga cement the support of LDP members and was re-appointed as the party's secretary-general, told a news conference that the top priority is dealing with the coronavirus, a view echoed by party policy chief Hakubun Shimomura.
""We will do everything we can to secure the vaccines and the medications to protect the people's lives and health, as well as support medical institutions,"" said Shimomura, a former education minister, adding that reviving the economy would be given nearly equal weight.
Suga may name Health Minister Katsunobu Kato, who has become well known to the public as the face of Japan's efforts to tackle the coronavirus, as chief cabinet secretary, Nippon TV said. Kato is close to Suga, under whom he served as deputy chief cabinet secretary.
""Many different elements are needed,"" Suga said on Monday, when asked about who should replace him. ""One is their fit with the prime minister, but thinking about it overall, they also need to have broad strengths, that will be the most calming.""
Suga is virtually certain to be elected prime minister in a parliamentary vote on Wednesday because of the LDP's lower-house majority. He will serve out Abe's term as party leader through September 2021.
Known more for his work behind the scenes, Suga emerged as favourite to replace Abe, Japan's longest-serving premier, after Abe said last month he would resign because of ill health.

There is widespread speculation that Suga could take advantage of strong support ratings to dissolve the lower house of parliament and call snap elections to earn a full three-year term as LDP head, but he appears wary.

""China's authorities have under certain circumstances detained foreigners citing 'endangering national security',"" the British Foreign Office said in its latest advice posted on its website.
""There is also a risk of arbitrary detention, including of British Nationals,"" it said. 
British advice previously contained no reference to the risk of arbitrary detention.

""But the level of our advice has not changed,"" the spokesman said.
The British warning comes after several foreigners were detained in China on national security charges, including Canadians, Australians, Japanese and at least one American. Some of them remain in detention.
In one of the latest high-profile cases, Cheng Lei, an Australian citizen and anchor on Chinese state television, was detained in August for ""carrying out criminal activities endangering China's national security,"" according to China's foreign ministry.
Her detention follows a period of strained relations between China and Australia.

Appliance-maker Husqvarna AB (ST:HUSQb)said last week it will resume dividends thanks to favorable market conditions and a healthy cash position. Forestry company Holmen AB (ST:HOLMa) and real estate firms Kungsleden AB (ST:KLED) and  Wallenstam  AB (ST:WALLb) have announced similar plans.
And there’s more to come, according to Martin Guri, Kepler Cheuvreux’s head of Nordic strategy.
“More companies will pay dividends, either this year or double the next,” said Guri, who expects to see payouts across “all sectors” except banks given a recommendation by Sweden’s financial watchdog not to distribute dividends for 2019.
Sweden’s economic outlook has steadily improved in recent months. In August, the government forecast a 4.6% GDP contraction this year, compared with the 7% slump feared back in May. For next year, GDP is seen growing 4.1%, representing a stronger rebound than previously estimated.
The stronger macro numbers were reflected in second quarter results at Sweden’s biggest companies. Of the firms listed on the OMX Stockholm 30 Index, more than two-thirds beat earnings estimates last quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“There is scope for substantial dividends or share buybacks in many companies for the financial year of 2020,” Danske Bank senior strategist Mattias Sundling said, adding that “the majority” will likely not distribute for 2019.
‘Cheap Insurance’
Distributing money to shareholders in the middle of a global pandemic remains controversial. Two-thirds of companies on Sweden’s benchmark stock index have either withdrawn, lowered or postponed their dividend decisions for 2019. Of them, Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Copco AB, Investor AB and about 10 others say they can still opt to distribute funds, according to their public statements.

The Stockholm-based Agency for Economic and Regional Growth says it will demand repayment of state support from any firms that pay dividends. In a similar vein, Sweden’s financial watchdog says banks shouldn’t distribute dividends at all this year.
“Suspending dividend payments is a cheap insurance policy,” Erik Thedeen, the Financial Supervisory Authority’s Director General, said earlier this month. “If we experience a sharp decline, the banks will need the capital to boost the economy.”
Danske Bank’s Sundling nevertheless sees “a 50% chance that banks will pay dividends this year,” he said.

In the unverified footage, which circulated on Monday, the group taunt the woman, referring to her as 'al-Shabaab' - a local term for an Islamist insurgent group that has been operating in the northern-most province of Cabo Delgado since 2017, with no known link to the Somali group of the same name. 
One hits her in the head and body with a stick before others shoot and, they say in the video, kill her on the side of the road. 
In a statement released late on Monday, the army, engaged in a battle with insurgents in the province, also home to blockbuster gas projects being developed by oil majors like Total, said it considered the images shocking and horrifying, and ""above all condemnable"". 
""The FDS (Defence and Security Forces) reiterate that they do not agree with any barbaric act that substantiates the violation of human rights,"" it said, calling for an investigation into the video's authenticity. 
The footage comes amid allegations of abuses by government soldiers in Cabo Delgado. After an escalation in the insurgency, which saw the capture of a key port town in August, and the security forces' response, reports and videos of beatings or other abuses have become increasingly common. 
Last week, Amnesty International said it had verified videos showing attempted beheadings, torture and other ill treatment of prisoners, the dismemberment of alleged opposition fighters and possible extrajudicial executions.
The government dismissed the allegations, saying insurgents regularly impersonated soldiers in an attempt to confuse national and international public opinion. 
Zenaida Machado, researcher for Human Rights Watch, called for an investigation and said such acts, if committed by soldiers, sowed distrust in the population and strengthened insurgents' narrative. 
""It's the worst case of betrayal,"" she said, adding that frightened people should not run from insurgents only to find themselves in danger from those supposed to keep them safe.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan's next prime minister, Yoshihide Suga will face an early, and difficult, leadership decision: whether to call an general election before his honeymoon with voters fades or wait and risk seeing ratings slide.
The decision will affect Suga's chances of holding office beyond the remainder of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's term, which expires next year. A successful early election may also help him gain momentum to push his agenda, including deregulation and smashing bureaucratic silos. [L4N2GB2NN]
Suga won a ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership poll on Monday, and the party's parliamentary majority means he is virtually guaranteed to replace Abe, who is resigning after nearly eight years as prime minister because of illness.
Suga acknowledged on Monday that the question of timing for a lower house election was a tough call amid worries about the coronavirus and a slumping economy. A poll for the powerful chamber must be held by late October 2021.
A dozen years ago, Taro Aso was expected to call a snap election soon after taking office as premier, while his ratings were relatively high. He waited, his popularity declined and when he called an election in 2009, the LDP lost power for three years.
The memory of that trauma lingers, although the LDP's opposition is far weaker now. 
""There's only a year left, so the timing of when to dissolve the lower house is a vexing problem,"" Suga told a news conference after a landslide victory in the party vote.
Speculation has swirled that Suga would call a lower house poll for as early as next month. Aso, now finance minister, said on Tuesday an early election should be considered because the Olympic Games will be held in Japan next year.
On Monday, Suga sounded cautious, saying his priorities were to end the coronavirus outbreak and revive the economy.
COALITION PARTNER WARY
A robust LDP election performance would boost Suga's chances of winning a full three-year term next year.
Long seen as more of a backroom operator than a top leader, Suga's ratings have jumped since he began running for the LDP post. Some party insiders fear that rise could be short-lived. 
""Mr. Suga is good at making deals, but he's not especially talented at answering questions in parliament,"" said one LDP senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Scenarios floated for an early election include Oct. 25, Nov. 1 and Dec. 6, which is Suga's birthday. 
An early poll would also diminish chances the LDP would lose seats because the newly unified opposition would have less time to prepare. 
""Objectively, it is certain that sooner is better for the LDP,"" said independent political analyst Atsuo Ito.
Abe's success in leading the LDP to big wins in six national elections - aided by a weak opposition and low turnout - was key to his tenure as Japan's longest-serving prime minister. Before Abe, Japan suffered a succession of short-lived leaders.
The LDP's junior coalition partner, the Komeito party, is against an early election, and opinion polls show the public is more focused on steps to fight COVID-19 and reboot the economy than going to the polls. 
Voter surveys measuring Suga's popularity after he takes office on Wednesday could guide the decision.

""It's true calls in the LDP for an early election are growing but Suga is cautious,"" said Tomoaki Iwai, a Nihon University professor. ""We have to see the opinion polls.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will use his annual address to world leaders next week to push for a global ceasefire until the end of 2020 so countries can fight the coronavirus pandemic, but he said opportunities will be lost because presidents and prime ministers are not physically in New York.
Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin had been expected to make rare appearances at U.N. headquarters to help mark the 75th anniversary of the 193-member world body. The pandemic means, however, that the two are among some 170 heads of state and government due to make video statements during the week-long meeting starting on Sept. 22.
U.S. President Donald Trump is the only leader considering delivering his address in person on the first day, when Guterres will also deliver his address in person. 
The gathering to mark the start of a new session of the General Assembly has previously been dubbed diplomatic speed dating by some officials due to the hundreds of meetings that traditionally happen on the sidelines. 
""It is obvious that diplomacy depends a lot on human contact. And so we will have a loss because of that, especially for what is my first priority at the present moment ... the implementation of the global ceasefire,"" Guterres told Reuters on Monday at the United Nations.
'SIGNALS OF HOPE'
Since the first call for the ceasefire in March as the coronavirus spread, Guterres said there had already been some ""positive signals"" with peace deals in Sudan, the start of talks between Afghanistan's government and the Taliban, a lull in violence in places like Syria, Libya and Ukraine and ""intense negotiations"" on a truce to lead to talks in Yemen.
""There are signals of hope, but we need to mobilize the whole of the international community to make this global ceasefire be a reality until the end of the year,"" said Guterres, a former prime minister of Portugal who began a five-year term as U.N. chief in 2017.
Guterres said a global ceasefire would boost efforts to contain COVID-19 and help create conditions for a coordinated, sustainable, inclusive recovery from the pandemic.
He initially called for a global truce on March 23, but it took the 15-member U.N. Security Council more than three months to formally support his call because of a standoff between the United States and China. Washington did not want the resolution to reference the World Health Organization, while Beijing did.
'MOMENT OF TRUTH'
Simmering tensions between the United States and China have boiled over during the pandemic as Washington blames Beijing a lack of transparency that contributed to the global spread of COVID-19, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year.
Globally there have been nearly 30 million novel coronavirus infections and more than 900,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.
As the United Nations marks 75 years since it was established after World War Two - to prevent a similar conflict from occurring again - Guterres said multilateralism needed to reform to better reflect the world today.
""If ... in this moment of truth, we are able to do the reforms necessary to have a truly net-worth multilateralism and a truly inclusive multilateralism, I do believe that multilateralism will prevail and that nationalism, populism that is spreading will, in the end, fail,"" he said.
He said the pandemic and issues such as climate change, lawlessness in cyberspace and renewed nuclear proliferation show ""it is clear that the world is very fragile.""

Guterres added: ""My hope is that, in the present moment, leaders will be humble enough to recognize our fragility and to understand that we need unity, solidarity and international cooperation.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A voter-outreach effort by the U.S. Postal Service drew a growing backlash on Monday as election officials in several states warned voters that the embattled agency was providing inaccurate information about how to vote in the Nov. 3 election.
The statements by officials in West Virginia, Maryland, Utah and Washington state come after a federal judge in Colorado on Saturday ordered the Postal Service to cease delivery of postcards he said contained ""false or misleading information"" about how to cast ballots by mail.
The Postal Service says it is trying to comply with the order, even though most of those postcards in Colorado have already been delivered. It has asked U.S. Judge William Martinez to reverse his decision. 
""The intention of the mailer was to send a single set of recommendations that provided general guidance allowing voters who choose mail-in voting to do so successfully, regardless of where they live and where they vote,"" spokeswoman Martha Johnson said.
The dispute comes after cost-saving measures ordered by new Postmaster Louis DeJoy led to widespread mail delays in August, causing some to question whether their ballots will be handled properly. DeJoy suspended those changes in the face of widespread public outrage.
The postcards in question, mailed nationwide last week, tell voters to request mail ballots at least 15 days before the election. 
However, several states - Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Utah, Hawaii and California - mail ballots automatically to all registered voters. 
Election officials in Washington state and Utah told voters they do not need to request a ballot. 
In Colorado, the secretary of state's office plans automated phone calls to explain that the Postal Service mailer contains inaccurate information, spokesman Steve Hurlbert said.
Officials in Maryland and West Virginia also said the Postal Service's recommended deadlines conflicted with their state laws.
California's secretary of state, Alex Padilla, told Reuters he was ""deeply concerned"" about the potential for voter confusion.
""State and local elections officials have had to spend a significant amount of time correcting election misinformation and disinformation,"" Padilla said. ""This USPS postcard, without input from elections officials, does not help.""

(This story corrects title of Alex Padilla from attorney general to secretary of state in the 11th paragraph.)

It is the first time since the November 2016 peace deal between the government and the demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) that a group of former commanders, including former leader Rodrigo Londono, known by nom de guerre 'Timochenko', have asked for forgiveness and accepted they had made mistakes. 
""We are here to publicly ask forgiveness of all our victims and their families from the bottom of our hearts,"" the now-members of the FARC political party said in a statement. The party preserved its Spanish initials after changing its name to the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force.
""The kidnappings were a serious error for which we can only apologize,"" they said.
Colombia's government and human rights groups accuse the demobilized guerrillas of having kidnapped thousands of civilians and members of the armed forces during the rebels' part in a more than 50-year conflict that has left 260,000 dead and millions displaced.
The members of the FARC political party admitted kidnappings had deeply wounded those affected and damaged their legitimacy and credibility beyond repair by having deprived their victims of their dignity and freedom. 
The FARC leaders reiterated their commitment and willingness to testify about what took place during the conflict in court hearings and to give explanations to Colombian society.
Former rebel leaders are in the process of giving testimonies in the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), a court that can impose sentences restricting freedom for between five and eight years on those who acknowledge responsibility and confess to their crimes.
However, those who do not take responsibility for their crimes will receive jail sentences of between 15 and 20 years.

(Reuters) - Rochester, New York, Mayor Lovely Warren on Monday fired Police Chief La'Ron Singletary and suspended two city officials over the handling of the asphyxiation death of Daniel Prude in police custody, as she called for a federal review of the case. 
Video footage, released by Prude's family, showed officers using a mesh hood and pinning the 41-year-old Black man to the pavement during the March arrest. 
The footage has raised questions of a possible cover-up and turned Rochester into the latest flashpoint in a summer of protests over racial injustice and policing first sparked by George Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis police custody.
""We have a pervasive problem in the Rochester Police Department, one that views everything through the eyes of the badge and not the citizens that we serve,"" Warren said during a news conference. ""It shows that Mr. Prude's death was not taken as seriously as it should have been."" 
Warren also announced that she also suspended City Corporation Counsel Tim Curtin and Communications Director Justin Roj without pay for 30 days for ""failure to act, inform and follow policy and procedures."" 
Warren said she made the decision to terminate Singletary and suspend Curtin and Roj after reading an internal review of the case.
""Never again can we allow any man or woman to needlessly die in police custody nor can we treat the review of a case as carelessly as we have done with this case,"" she said. 
Warren called on the U.S. Attorney General's office to conduct an investigation to determine if Prude's civil rights were violated. 
She also directed the city's Office of Public Integrity to investigate and determine if she or any city employee violated city policies or ethical standards. 
Singletary resigned last Tuesday along with his command staff, saying there had been a “mischaracterization and politicization” of his actions following the death of Prude in police custody. It was unclear when the resignations were to take effect. 
Seven police officers involved in the arrest were suspended on Sept. 3 shortly after protests erupted following the release of the video of Prude's arrest. The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide by asphyxiation, with the drug PCP a contributing factor. He was having a psychotic episode when he was arrested.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's government on Monday made a final push to sell lottery tickets for the value of the last president's luxury jet, amid criticism the plan had failed despite a government department spending about $24 million on tickets.
Nearly 70% of tickets have been sold ahead of a so-called ""raffle"" on Tuesday that will give 100 winners close to $1 million each, a Mexican lottery official said at President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's morning news conference.
The total prize money of 2 billion pesos ($95 million) loosely represents the value of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner used by prior President Enrique Pena Nieto that Lopez Obrador has cast as a symbol of excess and corruption in a country where about half the population lives in poverty. 
After Lopez Obrador failed in initial attempts to sell the plane, he opted to hold a lottery aimed at raising 3 billion pesos ($142 million) for hospital supplies, as officials continue efforts to offload the customized jet. 
Enough money had been raised to cover the prizes, Lopez Obrador said. But with just over 2 billion pesos raised, the government appeared well short of its goal of gathering money for health.
""I urge everyone, everyone, to keep buying tickets,"" Lopez Obrador told his regular news conference on Monday. Sales will close a couple of hours ahead of the 4 p.m. announcement of winners on Tuesday, the day before Mexican Independence Day.
Lopez Obrador said last February he was confident all 6 million tickets, at 500 pesos a piece, would be sold. 
There were signs that the effort was not so simple, and several newspaper columnists said not enough had been raised to make the program worthwhile.
The federal Institute of Health for Wellness distributed tickets to 951 public hospitals, saying they should use any prize money for medical equipment. Yet, at a cost of nearly 500 million pesos, critics questioned why the funds weren't allocated directly for immediate needs. 
""To save lives, public policies and budgetary designations should stem from knowledge and data, not from chance and propaganda,"" former health minister Salomon Chertorivski wrote on Twitter.
The director of housing agency Infonavit in a video presentation urged staffers above a certain salary level to buy between five and 12 tickets each before Sept. 4 and show their receipt to managers, television station Televisa reported.
An Infonavit employee who bought nine told Reuters the ""invitation"" seemed unfair. 
""Many colleagues felt it was an obligation,"" said the employee, who asked not to be named. ""We are fortunate to have jobs, but that doesn't mean we should have to buy tickets.""
When asked if government workers had to chip in, Lopez Obrador said participation was voluntary. 
Some lottery participants said they were proud to support a good cause. 
Gerardo Diaz, 63, a cook in the northern border city of Tijuana, said if selected, he would frame the winning ticket - which bears the image of the 80-seat Dreamliner - to show his grandchildren. 
""So that when they see it, they know we were part of making history in Mexico,"" he said. ""What's more, today I'm going to go buy another ticket.""

Trump has led Democratic opponent Joe Biden on the handling of the U.S. economy in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election, while trailing him in areas such as who would better manage the coronavirus pandemic and healthcare.
The Trump campaign still plans to highlight the law-and-order theme, which Trump emphasized throughout a summer of protests for racial justice ignited by the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody in Minnesota.
But the new ads will instead focus on the economy, the official said. Trump has vowed to rebuild the pandemic-battered economy if given a second term.
""It's a focus on the economy as the defining issue of the campaign. Law and order is something that the campaign and the president will still talk about for sure,"" the official said.
The official, who confirmed Fox News' report on the ad buy, said the new ads would run in several states vital to Trump winning re-election.
Trump is embarking on a heavier fundraising schedule in coming weeks as his re-election campaign faces a possible cash crunch that has forced it to pull back television advertising in some crucial states.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has launched an internal inquiry into circumstances surrounding the decision to ease sentencing recommendations for President Donald Trump's long-time friend Roger Stone, a spokeswoman confirmed.
""We welcome the review,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.
The review by the department's inspector general comes after Aaron Zelinsky, a career prosecutor, told lawmakers during a congressional hearing in June that his office received ""heavy pressure from the highest levels of the Department of Justice"" to ease its sentencing recommendation for Stone, a political ally of the president.
""Roger Stone was being treated differently from every other defendant. He received breaks that are, in my experience, unheard of,"" Zelinsky told the House Judiciary Committee during his testimony.
He and three other prosecutors withdrew from the case after senior department officials filed a new sentencing memo that backed away from the original recommendation of seven to nine years in prison.
Stone, 67, was convicted of obstruction, witness tampering and lying to Congress during its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
In July, Trump commuted Stone's sentence and proclaimed that Stone had been targeted by ""an illegal witch hunt.""
The inspector general's inquiry into Stone's sentencing was reported earlier on Monday by NBC News. According to that report, the review was triggered by Zelinsky's testimony.
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General said she can neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation.
Stone did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the news.

WILMINGTON, Del./MCLELLAN PARK, Calif. (Reuters) - Joe Biden branded President Donald Trump a ""climate arsonist"" on Monday for failing to acknowledge global warming's role in deadly wildfires sweeping the western United States, while Trump said the crisis stemmed from lax forest management.
Dozens of conflagrations have raged with unprecedented scope across more than 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares) in Oregon, California and Washington state since August, laying waste to several small towns, destroying thousands of homes and killing at least 35 people.
The fires also have filled the region's air with harmful levels of smoke and soot, bathing skies in eerie tones of orange and sepia while adding to a public health crisis already posed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Ten deaths have been confirmed during the past week in Oregon alone, the latest flashpoint in a larger summer outbreak of fires accompanied by catastrophic lightning storms, record-breaking heat waves and bouts of extreme winds.
Those incendiary conditions gave way over the weekend to cooler, moister weather and calmer winds, enabling weary firefighters to gain ground in efforts to outflank blazes that had burned largely unchecked last week.
Fire managers cautioned that the battle was hardly over. Thunderstorms forecast for later in the week could bring much-needed rain but also more lightning. Officials also braced for a rise in the death toll.
As disaster teams scoured the ruins of dwellings engulfed by flames amid chaotic evacuations last week, Oregon's emergency management authorities said they had yet to account for 22 people reported missing in the fires.
At least two dozen people have perished in California wildfires since mid-August, and one fatality has been confirmed in Washington state.
FIRES FOCUS CAMPAIGN ON CLIMATE 
Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee slammed by Republicans for not visiting disaster areas, spoke from his home state of Delaware on the threat of increasingly frequent weather extremes that scientists have pointed to as evidence that climate change is supercharging the fires.
Trump, who trails Biden in national polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election, met with firefighters and officials in California after Democrats blasted the Republican president for remaining mostly silent on the wildfires.
""I think this is more of a management situation,"" Trump answered, when asked by a reporter if climate change was a factor behind the fires. Without mentioning large wildfires that have raged elsewhere around the world in recent years, from southern Europe to Australia and Siberia, Trump asserted that other countries ""don't have this problem.""
""They have more explosive trees, meaning they catch fire much easier,"" he said. ""But they don't have problems like this.""
The president and his administration have sought to pin the blame for large wildfires on state officials, saying fuel-choked forests and scrub need to be thinned, more firebreaks need to be cut and flammable debris cleared from forest floors. 
Trump said improved forest management was something that could be tackled quickly, whereas climate change would take more time and require international cooperation that he said was lacking.
""When you get into climate change, well is India going to change its ways? And is China going to change its ways? And Russia? Is Russia going to change its ways?"" he said after landing in McLellan Park, California.
'IT'LL GET COOLER'
Trump has referred to climate change as a ""hoax,"" and in 2017 pulled the United States out of the Paris accord that laid out an international approach to global warming. Biden, the former vice president, has included climate change on his list of major crises facing the United States.
Calling Trump a ""climate arsonist,"" Biden said: ""If we have four more years of Trump's climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned by wildfires? How many suburban neighborhoods will have been flooded out?""
California Governor Gavin Newsom acknowledged more needs to be done to better manage forests to reduce fire risks, while more than a century of aggressive fire suppression has allowed fuels to build up.
But he countered that global warming was nevertheless a driving factor in newly extreme wildfire behavior, and he reminded Trump that 57% of forest land in California is under federal ownership.
“We come from a perspective, humbly, where we submit the science is in and observed evidence is self-evident: that climate change is real, and that is exacerbating this,” the Democratic governor said during a meeting with the president.
Trump, who has authorized federal disaster aid for both California and Oregon, questioned that science.
“It’ll start getting cooler, you just watch,” he said. “I don’t think science knows.”
ARSON ARREST
As improved weather conditions allowed firefighters to go on the offensive, tens of thousands of displaced residents continued to adjust to life as evacuees.
Around the devastated southwestern Oregon towns of Phoenix and Talent, some people set up food stations in parking lots, while others guarded homes from looters who tend to appear at dusk, according to a Reuters photographer. 
Seeking to reinforce local law enforcement resources strained by the disaster, Oregon is deploying as many as 1,000 National Guard troops to fire-stricken communities.
A man was charged with arson on Friday in connection with a blaze set near Phoenix, Oregon, and another man was arrested in Portland on Monday on suspicion of starting six small fires that did not burn any structures, authorities reported.

Police across Oregon have cautioned against fake social media accounts blaming wildfires on left-wing anti-fascists or right-wing Proud Boy activists.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un praised his military for its prompt efforts to rebuild towns hit hard by typhoons and summer floods, state news media KCNA reported on Tuesday.
Kim visited the province of North Hwanghae, south of Pyongyang, which had removed all traces of the natural disaster and been successfully re-built as a ""socialist fairyland"", said KCNA.
The visit was the latest by Kim to typhoon-hit areas of the country, issuing alerts ahead of the storms to prevent crop damage and casualties, then dispatching military and party members to help communities recover. 
""The People's Army is made up of creators of all miracles on this land,"" Kim praised his army in a statement carried by the KCNA. 
""The genuine might of the People's Army lies not in the number of troops and the might of ammunitions but in their ardent love for their country.""
North Korea was hit by ""disastrous meteorological phenomena"" this summer with heavy rains and typhoons, bringing the second highest rainfall in the past 25 years, the weather agency had said on Monday in a statement carried by KCNA. 
The country recorded an average 852.3 mm (34 inches) of summer precipitation throughout the country, more than triple the year earlier, KCNA said.

North Korea's agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable to severe weather, and this summer's storms and floods have raised concerns over the country's tenuous food situation.

The House of Commons passed the Internal Market Bill by 340 to 263 votes on its first main vote, allowing it to go through the next stage in the parliamentary process on Tuesday.
The prime minister said the proposed legislation, which will rewrite part of the withdrawal agreement, is “essential” to maintain the U.K.’s economic and political integrity. He accused the European Union of making “absurd” threats to stop food moving from mainland Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
“The EU hasn’t taken that particular revolver off the table,” Johnson told MPs. “It is such an extraordinary threat, and it seems so incredible the EU could do so, that we are not taking powers in this bill to neutralize that threat, but obviously reserve the right to do so.”
Johnson’s plan has thrown Brexit talks into turmoil. Last week, the EU threatened legal action in response and demanded he withdraw the proposed law by the end of September, a request the government has rejected.
If it passes Parliament, the bill risks sinking negotiations with the EU over a crucial trade agreement. Without that, Britain will face an economic shock at the year-end as tariffs and quotas are introduced on commerce with its biggest trading partner.
Members of Parliament on both sides of the house said the government’s admission that the proposed legislation would breach international law would weaken Britain’s place in the world and its attempts to call other countries -- including Russia, China and Zimbabwe -- to account.
“Britain has been a beacon in some very difficult places of the world for support for the rule of law and our support is relied upon,” former Tory International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said. “We have a duty to uphold the rule of law.”
Conservative former Attorneys General Geoffrey Cox and Jeremy Wright said they wouldn’t back a bill that breaks international law, and were joined by former finance minister Sajid Javid. Rehman Chishti, Johnson’s special envoy for freedom of religion or belief, quit earlier in the day, saying he couldn’t vote for the plan.
“I understand how some people will feel unease over the use of these powers, and I share that sentiment myself and I have absolutely no desire to use these measures,” Johnson said. “They are an insurance policy, and if we reach agreement with our European friends -- which I still believe is possible -- they will never be invoked.”
Tory rebels did offer the prime minister a potential way out with a proposed amendment -- which wasn’t put to a vote on Monday -- that would require the government to hold a further vote in the House of Commons before it could change the terms of the withdrawal agreement.
Opposition lawmakers lined up to accuse Johnson of failing to deliver on his promise at December’s general election that his deal was “oven ready.” They also said he had failed to live up to his claims that he had provided protection against the exact issues on the Irish border he is now seeking to repair.
“It’s his deal, his mess, his failure,” Ed Miliband, Labour’s business spokesman, told the Commons. “This is the wrong thing to do, it’s not necessary and it’s deeply damaging for the country.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday won the first of several votes in parliament on his plan to undercut the Brexit treaty, though he faces a growing rebellion among lawmakers who say breaking international law would tarnish Britain's reputation.
Johnson, who has a majority of 80 in the House of Commons, won the so-called second reading vote on the Internal Market Bill 340 to 263. A wrecking amendment was defeated shortly beforehand, though more will follow.
The EU says Johnson's bill would collapse trade talks and propel the United Kingdom towards a messy Brexit while former British leaders have warned that breaking the law is a step too far that undermines the country's image.
Johnson, though, said it was essential to counter ""absurd"" threats from Brussels including that London put up trade barriers between Britain and Northern Ireland and impose a food blockade - steps he said threatened the United Kingdom's unity.
""The EU still have not taken this revolver off the table,"" Johnson told parliament before the vote. ""What we cannot do now is tolerate a situation where our EU counterparts seriously believe that they have the power to break up our country.""
The EU has demanded Britain scrap the main parts of the bill by the end of September and that if not, there will be no trade deal at the end of the year to cover everything from car parts to food.

To back up its message, the European Commission has delayed a crucial decision on allowing London to continue clearing euro transactions for EU-based clients, a derivatives source told Reuters.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin bestowed a $1.5 billion loan on Belarus on Monday in a gesture of support for its leader Alexander Lukashenko, who flew to entreat his patron for help after five weeks of mass protests demanding his resignation.
A day after more than 100,000 protesters took to the streets of Minsk with chants of ""You're a rat"", Lukashenko met Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi in urgent need of help to maintain his 26-year grip on power.
""First of all, I want to thank you... personally thank you and all Russians, all those, and I will not list them, who were involved in supporting us during this post-election time,"" Lukashenko said.
The Kremlin said some of the new money would be used to refinance earlier loans.
Putin backed plans Lukashenko has previously announced for constitutional reform, which the opposition has dismissed as a stunt to retain power after a disputed Aug. 9 presidential election.
But his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would stand down a reserve of law enforcement officers and national guards that Putin had placed near the border late last month, ready to intervene in case the situation got out of control.
The move signalled Moscow's keenness to emphasise financial support, not force - and possibly its belief that a violent crackdown by Lukashenko's security forces has been effective enough to keep him in power in the former Soviet republic.
""We want Belarusians themselves, without prompting and pressure from outside, to sort out this situation in a calm manner and through dialogue and to find a common solution,"" Putin said.
Putin said, however, that defence cooperation would continue. Hours earlier, Russian news agencies reported Moscow was sending paratroopers for joint exercises.
AWKWARD MEETING
It was an uncomfortable encounter for the 66-year-old Lukashenko, who had antagonised Moscow shortly before the election by rounding up 32 Russian nationals that Belarus accused of being mercenaries sent to destabilise the country.
Lukashenko said he was ""very grateful"" for Moscow's support, adding that he had learned ""a very serious lesson"" from recent events. At one point, TV footage showed him mopping sweat from his brow with a handkerchief.
Since the election, which Lukashenko denies rigging in order to defeat opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, thousands of people have been arrested and nearly all opposition leaders jailed, deported or forced into exile. Police said they detained 774 people on Sunday.
Reacting to news of the Russian loan, Tsikhanouskaya wrote on social media platform Telegram: ""Dear Russians! Your taxes will pay for our beatings. We are sure that you would not want that.
""This may prolong the death throes of Lukashenko but it cannot prevent the victory of the people,"" she said.
The loan amount slightly exceeds the $1.4 billion that Belarus burned through in gold and foreign exchange reserves last month in order to support its rouble currency.
A Russian political analyst, Fyodor Lukyanov, said it was a significant boost for Lukashenko.
""At the moment Minsk doesn't have any sources of money apart from Moscow... For him, this was his main goal - debt refinancing and a new loan. He apparently achieved this,"" Lukyanov said.
""Given that they are giving him money and actively cooperating with him, (it shows) Moscow thinks he will remain in power, at least for now. The situation is stabilising gradually.""
The West has acted carefully, balancing sympathy with the pro-democracy movement against fear of provoking Russian intervention. French President Emmanuel Macron, in a phone call with Putin, repeated calls for a peaceful solution respecting the will of the Belarusian people.

Lukashenko has been a prickly ally of Russia in the past, and has had an awkward personal relationship with Putin. But the Kremlin has made clear it does not want to see an ally toppled by street protests, as happened in 2014 in Ukraine.

Shinzo Abe, who is set to hand over power on Wednesday, then brought stability over an eight-year period that saw him become Japan’s longest-serving prime minister. The challenge now is for his designated successor, Yoshihide Suga, to continue that run.
“If anyone has a chance of breaking the ‘curse,’ it’s Suga,” said Tobias Harris, an analyst at advisory firm Teneo Intelligence and author of a new biography of Abe. “His ability to control the bureaucracy, his relationships with the ruling coalition, and the public’s desire to avoid a return to the revolving door all suggest that he could be well positioned to win a term of his own next year and wield power for several years.”
Suga, the 71-year-old son of a northern strawberry farmer, easily won a vote Monday to lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and will be formally installed as prime minister during a parliamentary vote on Wednesday. He’ll initially serve the remaining year of Abe’s term in office, though some key party members have raised the prospect he may soon call an election to get a fresh mandate while the opposition remains weak.
Despite the devastation to the economy due to the coronavirus, Suga inherits a relatively stable Japan: Abe gradually improved frayed ties with China, safeguarded Japan’s military and economic interests after U.S. President Donald Trump took office and eased worries in financial markets. Investors had little reaction to Suga’s victory on Monday, signaling they don’t see a departure from the path of Abenomics -- a prospect that could send the yen surging and stocks sliding.
The ease of Suga’s victory is a good sign for his ability to manage the LDP factions. The party coalesced around him almost as soon as Abe announced his intent to step down over health issues in late August. Instead of a bruising fight, faction bosses opted for an election system that favored Suga, and within two days had lined up enough support for him to win -- even before official campaigning had started.
While Suga doesn’t have his own formal faction, he has honed his skills as a pragmatic backroom fixer during his time as Japan’s longest-serving chief cabinet secretary. His strong alliances with the likes of Toshihiro Nikai, an influential faction leader as well as LDP secretary general, underpinned his win on Monday.
Suga also has certain advantages over Abe’s predecessors who quickly lost public support due to policy stumbles or scandals. In the 50 years prior to Abe’s record run, Japan averaged a new prime minister about every two years.
For one, Suga’s blessed with an opposition that has largely failed to pose a threat in terms of voter support over the past eight years. A series of LDP prime ministers saw their policy agendas stymied in the opposition-dominated upper house of parliament, culminating in the party’s historic election defeat to the Democratic Party of Japan in 2009.
An expanded opposition bloc regrouped last week under leader Yukio Edano, who vowed to demand parliament open to debate coronavirus policy. But a poll in the Mainichi newspaper showed that two-thirds of respondents didn’t have positive expectations for the main opposition bloc.
“I don’t think there’s a high probability of a quick turnover of prime ministers,” said Yu Uchiyama, a professor at the University of Tokyo who has written books on Japanese politics. “The reasons why that happened before were weak standing within the party enabling powerful factions to oust a premier, or a ‘twisted parliament’ that hampered management.”
Abe Placed to Lead Japan Through 2021 After Big Election Win
Still, hurdles that have tripped up other leaders are in Suga’s path, including a campaign finance scandal with some of his associates and arrests for bribery related to his pet project of opening casino resorts in Japan. Suga hasn’t been directly implicated in any of these issues.
And while the factions back him now, they have a history of being fickle. The LDP at times has seemed more content to shuffle top posts among factions to maintain internal stability than back a leader for the long term -- a trend that could reemerge if Suga makes some early missteps.
The new leader will also take charge of an economy that saw the biggest contraction on record in the April-June quarter as the virus hit consumption. While its Covid-19 death toll is by far the lowest of any Group of Seven country, the cabinet’s handling of the pandemic has often come in for criticism.
One wild card is Suga’s skill in timing elections -- a factor that helped Abe stay in power so long. In 2017, he and Abe cut off a bid for the top job by Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike by calling a snap election before her new group was prepared.
Suga has said he doesn’t think the country’s in a situation to call an election due to the virus -- and polls indicate the public agrees. But that could change as a second Covid-19 wave fades: Tokyo successfully held a governor election in July.
With the LDP almost guaranteed victory whenever the vote is held in the coming year, Suga could then head into the 2021 party leadership election with a huge advantage as the incumbent prime minister, opening the way for another term at the top -- and keeping the revolving door firmly shut.
“I think Mr. Suga will work hard and aim for a long administration,” said LDP lawmaker Katsuei Hirasawa, a member of the leading Nikai faction. “There are a lot of things he wants to do.”

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra on Monday said that ""delusional lies"" are at the heart of the political turmoil the Andean copper-producing country is experiencing as the government fights to block impeachment proceedings against him. 
Vizcarra, who is due to finish his term in 10 months, said in a televised message that the crisis was triggered by a confidant's betrayal and a fragmented Congress that was seeking to destabilize the government.
""I must tell Peruvians that what is happening here is the betrayal of someone close to me,"" said Vizcarra
""I have to deeply regret and apologize to the country because a person from the presidential office whom I trusted, not from now but from years ago, has created this situation ... without any foundation,"" he added.
Lawmakers voted last week to impeach Vizcarra, who has no party representation in Congress, due to ""moral incapacity"" in a case of the alleged irregular hiring of a little-known singer who goes as ""Richard Swing."" 
The scandal broke after leaked audio recordings were shared in Congress by opposition lawmakers of Vizcarra discussing meetings with the singer. Some lawmakers alleged the recordings showed him trying to downplay his ties to the performer. 
Peru's government filed a lawsuit with the country's top court earlier on Monday in a bid to hold up impeachment proceedings. 
The potential ouster appeared to lose steam over the weekend, however, after several political leaders came out against it, saying it would spark further turmoil with Peru already facing its deepest recession in decades and the coronavirus pandemic.
Luis Huerta, a lawyer for the Ministry of Justice who presented the lawsuit, said the government's move aimed to ""temporarily suspend"" the impeachment process while the Constitutional Court looked into the matter.
""The lawsuit alleges that there is an improper use by Congress regarding its power to declare vacancy due to moral incapacity,"" he added.
On Saturday, Peru's prosecutor raided the homes of several people involved in the case, including officials close to Vizcarra and the singer, who was awarded government contracts for motivational talks for $49,500.

The vote to launch impeachment proceedings passed with 67 votes in favor, but an actual ouster would require a higher threshold of 87 votes from the 130 legislators. Vizcarra has been summoned to face lawmakers on Friday.

Saab said the U.S. citizen, Matthew John Heath, was plotting attacks against Venezuela's oil industry and electricity system. The OPEC member country, mired in a six-year economic crisis, is currently experiencing fuel shortages due to a collapse in output from its oil refineries as well as U.S. sanctions. 
The U.S. State Department had no immediate comment. 
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last week announced the capture of an unnamed U.S. citizen arrested while allegedly spying on the country's Amuay and Cardon refineries in western Falcon state, while carrying ""specialized weapons"" and large amounts of cash. Pro-government media published Heath's name over the weekend.
A U.S. government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Washington was investigating Venezuelan authorities' claims and advised skepticism. 
Saab said Heath was not carrying a passport and had entered illegally via the Colombian border, but that authorities found a passport photocopy hidden in one of his shoes. He also said Heath was carrying a ""coin"" linking him to the Central Intelligence Agency, without providing details, and said he had previously worked for a private military contractor. 
Saab added that three Venezuelan citizens, including one member of the military, were arrested and charged with treason as part of the alleged plot.
""They tried to fill the country with blood,"" Saab said. ""The Venezuelan state has managed to neutralize the plans to attack the oil industry and national electric system."" 

Caracas last month sentenced two former U.S. soldiers to 20 years in prison for their role in a May incursion aimed at ousting Maduro.

621,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 03:50PM ET</span>",U.S. court allows Trump to phase out immigrant humanitarian protections,"By Ted Hesson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday sided with President Donald Trump over his administration's decision to end humanitarian protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, many of whom have lived in the United States for decades.
In a 2-1 ruling, a panel of three judges in the California-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court decision that had blocked Trump's move to phase out so-called Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for people from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan.
The ruling is also expected to affect the status of people from Honduras and Nepal, who filed a separate lawsuit that was suspended last year pending the outcome of the broader case.
The appeals court ruling means that those immigrants will be required to find another way to remain in the United States legally or depart after a wind-down period at least until early March and longer in the case of El Salvador. 
Judge Consuelo Callahan, an appointee of Republican former President George W. Bush, wrote in a 54-page opinion that the Trump administration decisions to phase out the protections were not reviewable and therefore should not have been blocked.
Callahan also rejected a claim by plaintiffs that Trump's past criticism of non-white, non-European immigrants influenced the TPS decisions.
""While we do not condone the offensive and disparaging nature of the president’s remarks, we find it instructive that these statements occurred primarily in contexts removed from and unrelated to TPS policy or decisions,"" she wrote.
An attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which represents plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said on Monday that they planned to seek another ""en banc"" review of the matter by 11 of the appeals court's judges.
The attorney, Ahilan Arulanantham, called the decision ""deeply flawed"" during a call with reporters, and said the case eventually could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, depending on the outcome of the request for a broader appeals court review.
The termination of TPS for Haitians is also subject to separate litigation in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. The appeals court heard arguments in that case in June, but has not yet ruled.
Trump has made his tough immigration stance a hallmark of his presidency and 2020 re-election campaign against Democratic challenger Joe Biden. 
TPS allows foreigners whose home countries experience a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event to remain in the United States and apply for work permits. The status must be renewed periodically by the secretary of homeland security, who can extend it for six- to 18-month intervals.
The Trump administration has argued that most countries in the program have recovered from the related disasters or conflicts, while the status has been renewed for years beyond its need. 
The Biden campaign has called the TPS decisions ""politically motivated"" and said that Biden would protect enrollees from being returned to unsafe countries.

Immigrants from El Salvador make up the largest group of TPS recipients, with an estimated 263,000 Salvadorans covered by the program, but a bilateral agreement will allow Salvadorans an additional year to stay in the United States if the courts ultimately uphold Trump's termination.

""It is not an abandonment of the Palestinian cause ... it is to strengthen Bahrainis' security and their economic stability,"" minister Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa said in a statement. 
Bahrain on Friday said it would normalise relations with Israel, following the path of the UAE who declared it would do the same a month ago, in moves forged partly through shared fears of Iran. 
""Iran has chosen to behave in a dominating way in several forms and has become a constant danger that harms our internal security,"" Khalifa said, adding that it was wise to forestall dangers. 
The small Gulf state of Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, is ruled by the Sunni Muslim Al Khalifa family. The government often accuses Iran, ruled by a Shi'ite Muslim leadership, of seeking to subvert Bahrain.
Bahrain has suffered ongoing unrest since a failed uprising in 2011. It is also striving to bring down its deficit. 
Manama was bailed out in 2018 with a $10 billion aid package from wealthy Gulf neighbours to avoid a credit crunch. The International Monetary Fund has said it expects Bahrain's fiscal deficit to jump to 15.7% of gross domestic product this year from 10.6% in 2019.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has signed off on a two-year extension of a deal with China on the appointment of bishops that critics have condemned as a sell-out to the communist government, a senior Vatican source said on Monday.
The two-year provisional deal, which gives the pope the final say on the appointment of bishops, took effect on Oct. 22, 2018 and, if the Chinese side agrees - seen as virtually a given - will be extended without any changes, the source said.
""We think it is prudent to extend it for another two years,"" the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Some Catholics in Asia had feared China would pressure the Vatican to include Hong Kong, following the imposition of a new national security law that significantly expanded Beijing's reach into the city, but the source said it would not.
""There are no changes,"" he said of the accord, whose text is still secret. Church officials involved with the deal proposed that it be renewed and the pope gave the green light, he said.
Last week in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian indicated that China was also eager to renew, saying ""the two sides will continue to maintain close communication and consultation and improve bilateral relations"".
On Monday, the Vatican's Secretary of State and top diplomat, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, told reporters ""I think and I hope"" that Beijing wanted to renew.
Catholics in China are emerging from more than half a century of division that saw them split between a state-backed ""official"" Church and a ""non-official"" underground Church that remained loyal to Rome.
Both sides now recognise the pope as supreme leader of the Catholic Church.
""It's not easy dealing with a communist, atheist regime that sees religion as interference, but what we have is better than no accord at all,"" the source said.
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
China's constitution guarantees religious freedom, but in recent years the government has tightened restrictions on religions seen as a challenge to the authority of the ruling Communist Party.
Critics say this has made the deal a farce. The Vatican says no deal would have risked causing a schism in the Church in China.
One of the most outspoken critics has been Cardinal Joseph Zen, the former archbishop of Hong Kong, who has accused the Vatican of selling out and offending the memory of persecuted Catholics.
Beijing has been following a policy of ""Sinicisation"" of religion, trying to root out foreign influences and enforce obedience to the Communist Party, which has ruled China since winning a civil war in 1949.
""It is understandable for the Vatican to want to renew because after 1949 there was no dialogue. Now the Vatican at least has this thread, albeit a very weak one,"" said Father Bernardo Cerverllera, head of the Rome-based AsiaNews agency, which monitors China.
""But it has borne very little fruit so far and I hope the Vatican demands more from the Chinese,"" he said.
Many see the deal as precursor to re-establishing diplomatic relations after a rupture of more than 70 years.
To do so, the Vatican would have to break full relations with Taiwan, which Beijing considers a wayward province. The Vatican is the only state in Europe to still recognise Taipei.

""The path to diplomatic normalisation will be very, very long,"" the Vatican source said.

(Reuters) - The mayor of Lancaster, Pennsylvania on Monday called for an overhaul of how the city responds to mental health situations after a police officer shot and killed a 27-year-old man who ran at him, allegedly threatening him with a knife.
The shooting on Sunday sparked sometimes-violent protests overnight, turning the city of about 60,000 people into the latest flashpoint in a summer of civil unrest across the United States over racism and use of force by the police.
The Lancaster City Bureau of Police released body camera footage which appeared to show Ricardo Munoz cursing, and running at the officer with a knife in his right hand. The officer shot and killed Munoz, who died at the scene.
Munoz was out on $1 million bail after being charged with aggravated assault last year, court records showed.
At a press conference on Monday, Lancaster Mayor Danene Sorace called on the governor and state legislators to work together to come up with better protocols for responding to 911 calls involving people who may have mental health issues.
She said the shooting highlighted a broader problem of poverty impacting as many as half of the city's residents -- a predicament exacerbated by budget cuts and the coronavirus pandemic and disproportionately impacting minority communities.
""We must fund housing, social services, and education equitably and adequately in this city,"" she said. ""Lancaster, if we care so deeply about loving our neighbor then let's do it.""
The Lancaster police department said it had arrested 8 people early on Monday for arson and other crimes, with four of those detained from outside the county. Some protesters threw bricks at the police station and post office, the police said.
Lancaster County District Attorney Heather Adams said in a statement her office was investigating the shooting to determine whether there was a justified use of force.

She said a preliminary review showed ""that the officer fired as a man, clearly armed with a knife, ran toward the officer in a threatening manner.""

Islamabad (Reuters) - Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Monday he would like convicted rapists to be publicly executed or chemically castrated, reacting to a question on the rape of a woman on a highway last week that has caused uproar in the South Asian nation. 
Last week, a mother of two driving along a major highway near Lahore was dragged out of her car and raped by two men at gunpoint - one of whom was arrested by police on Monday. 
Khan said he believed the culprits should be hanged publicly, but added that officials had informed him that such an act could endanger a preferential trade status given to Pakistan by the European Union (EU). 
The EU's Generalized System of Preferences (GSP-plus) status, granted to Pakistan in 2014, is contingent upon observation of international conventions, such as human rights.
However, Khan said he was also looking into the option of chemical castration instead. 
""The way there is first degree, second degree, third degree murder, this [rape] should be graded in the same way, and when there is first degree [rape], castrate them. Operate on them and make them unable to do this,"" Khan said in an interview on a Pakistan news channel.
Khan's remarks came as Pakistani officials announced that one of the two main suspects in the motorway rape case had been arrested and had admitted to the crime. Officials said they also had a positive DNA match. The search for the second suspect is still ongoing. 
Police retrieved DNA samples from the site, and used GPS data from cellular phone networks to identify individuals who were at the site when the attack occurred. 
The shocking assault sparked nationwide protests and calls for the resignation of officials as well as the public hanging of rapists in Pakistan.

This February, lawmakers introduced legislation for the public hanging of those convicted of sexual abuse and the murder of children, but the law was not passed.

KAMITUGA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Pink painted coffins lined a hillside in eastern Congo on Monday as rescuers filled them with the bodies of victims of a gold mine cave-in, in which 50 people are feared dead.
Alexandre Ngandu Kamundala, deputy mayor of Kamituga, one of Democratic Republic of Congo's oldest gold-mining communities close to where the unofficial mine collapsed on Friday, said that 19 bodies have so far been found.
""All the inhabitants have stayed at home ... to pay tribute to the victims,"" Kamundala said, as an outpouring of grief continued, with shops and markets in Kamituga closed.
Dozens die each year in unregulated mines in Congo, where often ill-equipped diggers burrow deep in search of ore.
Agnes Wabiwa said her brother-in-law was among the dead.
""He was our sole breadwinner, we don't know how the family will continue to live without him,"" Wabiwa said.
The head of the local artisanal miners organisation Anselme Ndjungu said the lack of oversight by government or investment in proper tools or safety equipment made accidents inevitable.
""We cannot escape from such a catastrophe, because we are not supervised by services supposed to guide us,"" he told Reuters.

Congo is one of the largest artisanal gold producers in the region yet one of the smallest exporters, the United Nations said in a report this year, with tonnes instead smuggled into global supply chains through Congo's eastern neighbours.

Ankara and Moscow also back opposing sides in Syria. Russia, along with Iran, supports President Bashar al-Assad's forces and Turkey backs rebels looking to oust him. 
After an escalation of violence displaced nearly 1 million people and brought the two sides close to confrontation, Turkey and Russia agreed in March to halt hostilities. Both sides have said the ceasefire has held despite minor violations.

Speaking at a State Department meeting with Qatari Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, Pompeo said it was important to concentrate on countering Iranian activity in the Middle East.
""To keep our focus on this work and to close the door to increased Iranian meddling, it's past time to find a solution to the Gulf rift,"" Pompeo said.
""The Trump administration is eager to see this dispute resolved and to reopen Qatar's air and land borders currently blocked by other Gulf states. I look forward to progress on this issue."" 
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of backing terrorism. Qatar denies the charge and has accused its neighbors of seeking to curtail its sovereignty.
Kuwait and the United States have tried to mediate the rift, which has undermined Washington's efforts to confront Iran, which is struggling for regional supremacy with Saudi Arabia.
The boycotting nations have set 13 demands for lifting the boycott, including closing Al Jazeera television, shuttering a Turkish military base, reducing ties with Iran and cutting links to the Muslim Brotherhood.
The State Department's top diplomat for the Middle East, David Schenker, said last week there could be some progress within weeks in resolving the rift, citing signs of ""flexibility"" in negotiations.

With Trump's facing re-election on Nov. 3, he is eager to show foreign policy successes in the Middle East, and last month the UAE agreed to normalize ties with Israel under a U.S.-brokered deal scheduled to be signed at a White House ceremony on Tuesday. Bahrain joined the UAE in agreeing to normalize relations with Israel on Friday.

Veselin Mareshki, who is also a deputy speaker of Bulgaria's parliament, is head of the Volya party, which often backs the centre-right government in parliamentary votes and is also part of the pan-European far-right Identity and Democracy Party.
The court, in the Black Sea city of Varna, overturned a previous court ruling that had acquitted Mareshki, finding him and a Bulgarian woman guilty of threatening in 2014 to destroy the restaurant of a businessman if he did not make monthly payments of 10,000 levs ($6,070). 
The woman was sentenced to tree and a half years in jail. 
Mareshki, 53, the owner of a pharmacy chain and petrol filling stations, among other businesses, denies any wrongdoing and said he would appeal the verdict.
""Unfortunately at a time when our country is being accused of failing to jail corrupt politicians and oligarchs, obviously someone has decided that it is a good time to highlight my case,"" he told national radio BNR. 
""This is just temporary, until the Supreme Court rules (on my appeal). I have no intention of going to jail for something I did not do,"" he said.
Bulgaria ranks as the most corrupt member of the European Union and is yet to jail a high-level official on graft charges.

635,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>",Sea of Slush: Arctic sea ice lows mark a new polar climate regime,"By Natalie Thomas and Cassandra Garrison
ARCTIC OCEAN (Reuters) - At the edge of the ice blanketing part of the Arctic Ocean, the ice on Monday looked sickly. Where thick sheets of ice once sat atop the water, now a layer of soft, spongey slush slid and bobbed atop the waves. 
From the deck of a research ship under a bright, clear sky, “ice pilot” Paul Ruzycki mused over how quickly the region was changing since he began helping ships spot and navigate between icebergs in 1996. 
“Not so long ago, I heard that we had 100 years before the Arctic would be ice free in the summer,” he said. “Then I heard 75 years, 25 years, and just recently I heard 15 years. It’s accelerating.”
As if on cue, scientists on Monday said the vast and ancient ice sheet sitting atop Greenland had sloughed off a 113 square kilometer chunk of ice last month. The section of the Spalte Glacier at the northwest corner of the Arctic island had been cracking for several years before finally breaking free on Aug. 27, clearing the way inland ice loss to the sea, the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland https:// reported.
With climate change driving up Arctic temperatures, the once-solid sea ice cover has been shrinking to stark, new lows in recent years. This year’s minimum, still a few days from being declared, is expected to be the second-lowest expanse in four decades of record-keeping. The record low of 3.41 million square kilometers – reached in September 2012 after a late-season cyclonic storm broke up the remaining ice – is not much below what we see today.
""We haven't gone back at all to anything from 30 to 40 years ago,"" said climatologist Julienne Stroeve at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado. And as climate change continues, scientists say the sea ice is unlikely to recover to past levels.
In fact, the long-frozen region is already shifting to an entirely new climate regime, marked by the escalating trends in ice melt, temperature rise and rainfall days, according to new research published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.
Those findings, climate scientist Laura Landrum said, were “unnerving.” 
All three variables – sea ice, temperatures and rainfall – are now being measured well beyond the range of past observations. That makes the future of the Arctic more of a mystery. 
“The new climate can’t be predicted by the previous climate,” Landrum explained. “The year-to-year variability, the change in many of these parameters, is moving outside the bounds of past fluctuations.”
Sea ice coverage minimums, in particular, are now about 31% lower than in the decade after 1979, when satellite observations began. The ice has also lost about two-thirds of its bulk, as much of the thicker ice layer built up over years has long since melted away. The current ice regime actually began about two decades ago, the study found.
This vanishing of sea ice also contributes to the region’s warming, as the icy white expanse is replaced by patches of dark water that absorb solar radiation rather than reflecting it back out of the atmosphere. The process, referred to as Arctic amplification, helps to explain why the Arctic has warmed more than twice as fast as the rest of the world over the last four decades. 
The polar north will also likely see more days of rain rather than snow, which would further eat into the ice. For the new research, Landrum and her colleague Marika Holland at the National Center for Atmospheric Research analyzed sea ice, air temperature and precipitation data since 1950 to project climate scenarios up to the end of the century. They used computer simulations in the analysis and assumed the world’s release of greenhouse gas emissions would continue at a high trajectory.
Back in the Arctic Ocean aboard the Greenpeace Ship Arctic Sunrise research ship, biologist Kirsten Thompson of the University of Exeter said the new study was important in underlining “how fast and how profoundly the Arctic is changing.” 
For Thompson, that means big change for the region’s wildlife, from polar bears and insects to the whales she focuses on studying. “All their distributions are changing,” Thompson said. “We might find in the Arctic there will be winners and losers,” as new species enter the region and outcompete indigenous animals. 

“Other species certainly will not be able to survive in the future.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, a loyal aide to outgoing prime minister Shinzo Abe, won a landslide victory in a ruling party leadership election on Monday, paving the way for Japan's first change of leader in nearly eight years.
Suga, 71, who has promised to continue Abe's main policies, said his big win would give him the backing to pursue his reform goals - including deregulation and breaking down bureaucratic silos - and that containing the novel coronavirus and reviving the economy were conditions for calling a snap general election.
""As I got big support in numbers today, the environment in which I can pursue my policy agenda in a stable manner has been secured,"" Suga told a news conference. 
Suga won 377 votes out of 534 votes cast, and 535 possible votes, in the leadership election by Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of parliament and representatives of its 47 local chapters.
Rival Shigeru Ishiba, a former defence minister, won 68 votes and ex-foreign minister Fumio Kishida got 89. 
Suga is virtually certain to be elected prime minister in a parliamentary vote on Wednesday because of the LDP's lower-house majority. He will serve out Abe's term as party leader through September 2021.
Suga had emerged as frontrunner after Abe, Japan's longest-serving premier, said last month he would resign because of ill health, ending nearly eight years in office.
There is speculation Suga will call an election for the lower house of parliament as soon as next month to boost his chances of winning a full three-year term as LDP chief next year. A vote for the chamber must be held by late October 2021.
SNAP ELECTION?
But Suga sounded a cautious note.
""What's important now is to contain the pandemic while also reviving the economy. I don't think we can immediately (dissolve the lower house) just because the pandemic is contained,"" Suga said. ""That's a decision that must be made looking comprehensively at various factors.""
Suga has said he would continue Abe's signature ""Abenomics"" strategy of hyper-easy monetary policy, government spending and reforms while juggling the problems of COVID-19 and a slumping economy, and confronting longer-term issues such as Japan's ageing population and low birth rate.
Japanese manufacturers remained pessimistic for a 14th straight month in September, a Reuters poll showed, underlining the challenges ahead.
Suga, who has little diplomatic experience, faces geopolitical challenges such as building ties with the winner of the U.S. presidential election and balancing concern over China's maritime aggressiveness with bilateral economic interdependence.
The son of a strawberry farmer from northern Japan, Suga has since 2012 been chief cabinet secretary, acting as Abe's top government spokesman, coordinating policies and keeping bureaucrats in line.
""I was born as the oldest son of a farmer in Akita. Without any knowledge or blood ties, I launched into the world of politics, starting from zero - and have been able to become leader of the LDP, with all its traditions and history,"" said Suga, whose modest origins differ from many LDP lawmakers.
""I will devote all of myself to work for Japan and its citizens,"" he said after the party vote.
His image is more as a behind-the-scenes operator than a frontline leader but he rose in opinion polls after announcing his candidacy to succeed Abe. He won support from most LDP factions and won robust backing from LDP local chapters.
Nikkei business daily reported Suga plans to re-appoint Taro Aso, the boss of the party's second biggest faction, as his deputy prime minister and finance minister, the same positions Aso currently holds.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's factional rivalries put the brakes on moves to form a new government on Monday on the eve of a deadline agreed with France and stalling efforts to exit a dire economic crisis.
Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib met President Michel Aoun for talks after two leading politicians objected to the way the cabinet was being formed. Political sources said Adib did not present a list of ministerial names as had been anticipated.
Missing Tuesday's deadline could prove an early blow to a French effort to secure agreement from fractious politicians on reforms to root out corruption in return for foreign aid needed to resolve the worst crisis since Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war.
France's Foreign Ministry said Lebanese politicians needed to deliver on their promise to agree on a cabinet.
""It is up to them to translate this commitment into action without delay,"" spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said.
President Emmanuel Macron said on Sept. 1, during a visit a month after a devastating Beirut port blast, that Lebanese politicians agreed to form a cabinet in 15 days, or by Tuesday, an ambitious timeline given it usually takes months.
""The parties still have to fall into line,"" a French Elysee official said.
After meeting Aoun, Lebanon's prime minister-designate told reporters: ""God willing, all will be well.""
Sources with knowledge of the meeting said Adib told the Lebanese president he would return in a few days while Aoun consulted with various factions.
'TAKE A BREATH'
Shi'ite and Christian parties voiced objections on Sunday to the way the Sunni prime minister-designate was trying to form the government without the traditional consultations.
Adib, named on Aug. 31 after Macron's intervention just before his Beirut trip, has been working to form a cabinet of experts and plans to overhaul the leadership of ministries controlled by the same factions for years, sources say.
Nabih Berri, the prominent Shi'ite parliament speaker and ally of Iran-backed Hezbollah, said his group would not join a government formed on terms now proposed. But he said his group would cooperate in efforts to stabilise Lebanon.
There has been little comment from Hezbollah, the heavily armed and politically powerful movement Washington deems a terrorist group but which Paris says has a legitimate political role.
Any boycott by Berri and Hezbollah would deny the cabinet broad Shi'ite support in a sectarian system built on consensus among the nation's Muslim and Christian groups.
A political source said Aoun and Adib agreed ""that the sides take a breath to recrystalise this (government) formation in a way to protect it and secure its chances of succeeding.""
A senior politician said Adib told Aoun he would hold more consultations. He said if Adib gave into Berri's demands other factions would also want a say in picking ministers.
""We will be back to square zero,"" the politician said.
Berri wants to name the finance minister, a post held by a Shi'ite chosen by him since 2014. The minister will have a crucial role in drawing up Lebanon's economic rescue plan.

Political sources said he became more insistent after the United States applied sanctions on his senior aide, Ali Hassan Khalil, who previously held the post.

RABAT (Reuters) - Working conditions are so bad for some medics in Morocco handling a surging coronavirus outbreak that they have staged protests against inadequate staffing and poorly equipped facilities.
The kingdom recorded a record 2,430 cases on Friday and has confirmed more than 1,000 new cases every day since July - the steepest increase among its North African peers. 
Some intensive care units in hospitals are overrun while other wards are full, according to unions representing health workers, and the national nurses' movement said at least 526 of their members had been infected, aggravating staff shortages.
Anas Qarim, a nurse working at a hospital designated to treat COVID-19 in the central city of Meknes, said there were just three nurses and two doctors to treat 120 patients.
""Imagine wearing full protective gear in the summer heat working continuously for hours,"" he said, speaking at a protest last week by dozens of medics in Rabat demanding better pay and conditions, at least the third such demonstration in two weeks.
A Health Ministry spokesman did not respond to requests for comment about working conditions and inadequate staffing.
King Mohammed VI said last month that the health situation ""does not leave much room for optimism"".
Despite an intense three-month lockdown, the virus spread in Morocco and surged after restrictions were lifted, reaching more than 86,000 cases in total. 
For patients, problems have mounted. Queues for testing start forming at 5 a.m. at the Sheikh Khalifa hospital in Casablanca, three hours before opening time, according to a Reuters witness.
Those who are seriously sick struggle to get into hospital. Fatima Zahra Ait Lmahjoub already had three other members of her family in hospital with COVID-19 when her 71-year-old mother fell ill. 
She said it took her 12 hours to find a bed, and she had to ask at four different hospitals.
""My mother was unable to walk or breathe normally. Public hospitals didn't even offer an ambulance and asked me to take her by taxi,"" she told Reuters.
LACK OF TRUST
In Marrakech, rights activist Brahim Himmi said he had to wait nine hours to see a doctor at the Ibn Zorh hospital, where he said conditions were ""filthy and crowded"".Last month, pictures shared on social media showed patients lying on the floor there, causing an outcry from rights groups in the country.
""Many people go to hospital only when their symptoms are aggravated, because they don't trust the already frail health system,"" said Himmi, who recovered from COVID-19 in August.
The hospital did not respond when called for comment.
Videos posted on social media showed poor conditions at the Ibn Baja hospital in the northern city of Taza. In one, patients complained of not seeing a doctor for over a week.
They said they were given medication including hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug which several placebo-controlled studies suggest is ineffective to either treat or prevent the disease.
In one video, a patient at the same hospital could be seen helping to install an oxygen cylinder for a young woman who was struggling to breathe, because no staff were available.
The hospital did not respond when called for comment. Reuters could not independently verify the footage.
The Health Ministry has tried to raise capacity by setting up field hospitals - tents equipped with beds and oxygen. The government has also spurred industry to manufacture equipment.
But some medics say that staff shortages are the main problem, especially in poorer, less-developed rural areas. The World Health Organization (WHO) said there was only one doctor per 4,150 people in the southeastern Daraa Tafilalet region.
It recommends a minimum of 2.4 medics per 1,000 people. Nationally, Morocco has 0.7 doctors and 1.3 nurses per thousand, it said. Last year, the health ministry said there was a shortage of 32,000 doctors and 64,000 nurses. 

""Morocco needs more medical staff,"" said Jamal Eddine Kohen, head of the federation of intensive care doctors.

Local websites showed a video of Gulsanam Alijonova, 23, who has trained in boxing, karate and taekwondo, in which she chased and beat two men aged 30 and 33.
The video, shot in June, was shared and discussed on social media this month, but on Sept. 8 the Interior Ministry said it had identified the woman and launched a criminal case against her for hooliganism.
The move prompted a public outcry as Alijonova told local news website Daryo that the conflict had started when one of the two men ridiculed her T-shirt and shorts outfit and went on to insult her when she rebuked him.
Alijonova said the man grabbed her T-shirt when she confronted him, at which point she started throwing punches, and his companion tried to intervene.
A number of bloggers and public figures, including Saida Mirziyoyeva, the influential elder daughter of the president, criticised the move to prosecute Alijonova, contrasting it with a lenient attitude shown in the former Soviet republic towards domestic violence committed by men against women.
On Monday, police in the Namangan province where the incident took place said in a statement they have dropped the case after the state agency for youth affairs and the local youth union vouched for Alijonova, citing her sports achievements, previously clean record and volunteer work.

Saudi Arabia has a nascent nuclear programme that it wants to expand to eventually include proliferation-sensitive uranium enrichment. It is unclear where its ambitions end, since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in 2018 it would develop nuclear weapons if regional rival Iran did.
Riyadh has yet to fire up its first nuclear reactor, allowing its programme to still be monitored under the Small Quantities Protocol (SQP), an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency that exempts less advanced states from many reporting obligations and inspections.
""We are in conversation with them. They are interested in developing nuclear energy, for peaceful purposes of course,"" IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said when asked about verification in Saudi Arabia.
""So it is obvious that when they upgrade their activities including by the introduction of nuclear material in the kingdom, then we will have to have a stronger safeguards system. And nothing makes me think that this is not going to be the case.""
If Saudi Arabia were to introduce nuclear material into the research reactor in Riyadh that is near completion, it would void the SQP and its exemptions from regular safeguards.
The sides are also discussing an extra agreement known as the Additional Protocol that provides for tougher checks including snap inspections at undeclared locations, Grossi said.
Asked whether Riyadh should sign up to the Additional Protocol, he said: ""We are discussing everything.""
The talks are part of a push to get 31 states with early versions of the SQP to rescind them or switch to upgraded texts.

""This is essential to address a weakness in the IAEA safeguards system,"" Grossi said in a statement to the IAEA Board of Governors.

Protesters set up barricades and shut down down traffic in several towns including the commercial capital Abidjan, where a burning bus sent high plumes of black smoke from the densely-populated Yopogoun district. Demonstrators also torched a truck in the western city of Bangolo, witnesses said.
Violent protests have rocked Ivory Coast since Ouattara, in power since 2010, said he would run for a third term in elections scheduled for Oct. 31. Over a dozen people have died in clashes between protesters and police since August.
The constitution says the president can only stay in power for two terms, but Ouattara has argued that the publication of a new constitution in 2016 reset his terms. 
The unrest has political observers worried that the polls could destabilise Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer and French-speaking West Africa's largest economy. A disputed election in 2010 led to a brief civil war that killed over 3,000.
Monday's protests come ahead of the country's Constitutional Council decision, expected on Wednesday, on the eligibility of election candidates, including Ouattara. 
Forty-four candidates including former presidents Henry Konan Bedie and Laurent Gbagbo, and former rebel leader Soro Guillaume, have submitted paperwork to stand in the election, but is it is unclear whether Gbagbo and Soro would be able to run due to court procedures against them. 
Ouattara had announced in March that he will not run, but revised his decision after the sudden death of his handpicked successor Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly in July.

Among factors hindering their work were regulations, approval delays, violence against staff, and interference in needs assessments, monitoring and recipient lists, aid workers across Yemen told HRW.
Yemen has been described by the U.N. as experiencing the world's largest humanitarian crisis. Eighty percent of the population relies on assistance and, even before novel coronavirus, the healthcare system had collapsed. 
Yemen has been mired in conflict since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in March 2015 to restore the government ousted from power in the capital Sanaa by Iran-aligned Houthi forces in 2014. The Houthis, under whose control the majority of Yemen's population live, say they are fighting a corrupt system.
HRW identified systematic interference in relief operations by the Houthi authorities, Yemen's Saudi-backed internationally recognised government and affiliated forces, and the United Arab Emirates-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC). 
Houthi authorities told HRW that allegations of aid interference were ""baseless"". The Yemeni government and the STC did not respond to HRW, the report said. 
International humanitarian law requires parties to a conflict to allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded impartial aid to civilians in need, HRW said.
Recent months saw some improvement between humanitarian organisations and Houthi authorities, including granting permissions and dropping an aid tax. But aid workers told HRW they worry new restrictions could appear.
""Millions have been suffering in Yemen because the Houthis and other Yemeni authorities have denied the U.N. and other aid agencies unhindered access to people in need,"" report author Gerry Simpson said.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Mal Shehu Ladan took a boat across what was, until this month, a growing rice paddy. Now, like thousands of hectares of rice in Nigeria's Kebbi state, it is under water. 
""Almost all my farm has been flooded. I didn't harvest any rice,"" Ladan told Reuters. ""It's going to be devastating.""
Floods early this month across northwest Nigeria destroyed 90% of the 2 million tons that Kebbi state officials expected to harvest this autumn, the head of the state branch of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. The loss amounts to some 20% of the rice Nigeria grew last year, and the waters are still rising. 
Farther south, outside Nigeria's capital, Abuja, chicken farmer Hippolite Adigwe is also worried. A shortage of maize forced him to sell most of his flock of more than 1,000 birds, and the 300 left are hungry. Chicken feed prices have more than doubled, and he isn't sure how long he can cope. 
Twin crises, floods and maize shortages, come just after movement restrictions and financing difficulties caused by COVID-19 containment measures complicated spring planting.
Some farmers and economists say it could push Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, into a food crisis. Rice is the country's staple grain, and chicken is a core protein. 
""There is a real fear of having food shortages,"" Arc Kabir Ibrahim, president of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria told Reuters. ""The effect on the food system is going to be colossal."" 
Nigeria took roughly 4,000 tons of millet and sorghum from the regional economic bloc's (ECOWAS) strategic stocks last month and released 30,000 tons of its own maize. It also gave four companies special permission to import maize. 
The prominent Nigerian Economic Summit Group has called for ""a complete overhaul"" of agriculture policy. 
Problems accessing foreign exchange to import food are adding to shortages. In July, the central bank added maize to a list of items for which importers are banned from using its dollars. Rice and fertilizer were already on the list, along with other items that Nigeria wants made locally. 
Last week, even as food prices spiked, President Muhammadu Buhari vowed that not one cent of central bank dollars would go to food or fertilizer imports, as Nigeria would continue encouraging local farmers over imports. 
Importers can use dollars from pricier parallel markets. But these are tough to find due to an oil price crash that has cut Nigeria's core source of foreign exchange.
SWITCHING GRAINS
Rice prices had already risen substantially due to a land border closure last year that aimed to stamp out smuggling and boost local production. 
Peter Clubb of the International Grains Council said the spike drove consumers to eat maize instead. This, along with a disappointing crop late last year and the foreign exchange issues, boosted maize prices to 180,000 naira per ton from around 70,000 naira in March. 
Farmers say that consumers grappling with inflation, the first hike in fuel prices since 2016 and a power price spike can only pay so much more for food. 
Ayodeji Balogun, chief executive at commodities exchange Afex, said the central bank's lending scheme for farmers has significantly expanded output, and can work long term. 
But the coming months will be tough. Fertilizer prices hit a record after a COVID-19 outbreak shut down country's sole urea plant for two weeks, meaning more farmers will skip fertilizers, limiting crop yields. 
""The worst is yet to happen,"" Balogun said. ""It is a problem across grains."" 
Buhari has pledged more support, and Agriculture Minister Muhammed Sabo Nanono visited the northwest area this weekend and promised to provide farmers with high-quality seeds and to set up a special committee to ensure they have all they need to plant new crops as soon as possible.
Adigwe, the chicken farmer, said he thinks barring foreign food in order to help farmers is not a bad idea, but ""there are some factors that were not considered.""

""Can local production sustain the population of Nigeria?""

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Lawyers for the United States on Monday asked judges at the United Nations' highest court to dismiss a case brought by Iran seeking to lift sanctions.
Lawyer Marik String said Iran had wrongly introduced a subject uncovered by a 1955 bilateral pact, the Treaty of Amity, which Tehran cites as the basis for going to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court.
It was ""an inescapable reality"", he added, that the real aim of Iran's legal suit is to restore a 2015 nuclear pact opposed by the administration of President Donald Trump.
""The measures Iran challenges remain critical to the United States' efforts to address national security threats posed by Iran including the current threat posed by its nuclear programme,"" String added. 
Washington imposed the measures when it abandoned the 2015 pact aimed at stopping Tehran developing nuclear weapons. 
Hearings this week in The Hague will only deal with the preliminary matter of whether the court has jurisdiction.
The Iranian side is to argue its case on Wednesday and a decision is expected by the end of the year.
In an earlier case involving frozen assets, the World Court ruled in 2019 that the friendship treaty could provide a legal basis for its involvement in an Iranian-U.S. dispute.
In October 2018, the court ordered the United States to ensure that sanctions against Iran did not affect humanitarian aid or civil aviation safety. 
String said Washington was abiding by earlier orders.
The ICJ's rulings are binding, but it has no power to enforce them, and the United States and Iran are both among a handful of countries to have ignored its decisions.

The Amity Treaty was signed before Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution and the sharp deterioration in ties with Washington.

BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Germany and France called on Russia on Monday to cooperate and investigate what happened to Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny after laboratories in France and Sweden independently confirmed that he was poisoned with the Soviet-style nerve agent Novichok.
The apparent assassination attempt has brought tensions between Russia and Europe to new heights and fuelled calls for sanctions against Moscow - including scrapping the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a Kremlin flagship project to bring more Russian gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea.
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of using the incident as a pretext to impose additional sanctions on Russia, the Interfax news agency reported. 
German army doctors at Berlin's Charite hospital, to which Navalny was evacuated after falling unconscious during a flight over Siberia last month, were the first to say he had been poisoned with Novichok. Navalny awoke from a coma last week.
German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said the initial findings had now been independently corroborated by laboratories in France and Sweden.
Samples taken from the Russian opposition politician had also been sent to the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague for additional tests in their labs, Seibert added.
""We renew our call for Russia to explain these events,"" Seibert said.
French President Emmanuel Macron's office said in a statement after holding a telephone call with President Vladimir Putin that Moscow had to explain itself now.
""The president expressed his deep concern over the criminal act perpetrated against Alexei Navalany and the imperative that all light be shed, without delay, on the circumstances and responsibilities of this attempted assassination,"" Macron's office said.
Macron expressed his full solidarity with Germany on the steps to be taken and the consequences to be drawn from the situation, it added.
""Clarification is needed from Russia in the context of a credible and transparent investigation,"" the Elysee said.
According to a Kremlin readout of the call, Putin told Macron that it was ""inappropriate"" to make groundless accusations against Russia over the Navalny case.
Putin said that Russia wanted Germany to hand over medical test results taken from Navalny, the Kremlin added.
In an update on Navalny's health status, the Charite hospital said his condition continued to improve.

""The patient has been successfully removed from mechanical ventilation. He is currently undergoing mobilization and is able to leave his bed for short periods of time,"" it said.

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad will step down to work on President Donald Trump's re-election campaign, a U.S. official familiar with the matter said on Monday, departing Beijing at a time when the ties between the world's top two economies are at their worst in decades.
Branstad, previously the longest-serving governor of Iowa, a state in the U.S. Farm Belt which helped Trump get elected in 2016, will leave China in early October, the U.S. embassy said in a statement. 
""I thank Ambassador Terry Branstad for his more than three years of service to the American people as U.S. Ambassador to the People's Republic of China,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted. ""Ambassador Branstad has contributed to rebalancing U.S.-China relations so that it is results-oriented, reciprocal, and fair.""
On Saturday, Trump hinted that Branstad might be joining the campaign. In a video posted on Twitter by Iowa senator Joni Ernst, Trump said Branstad would be coming home. 
Branstad's departure leaves the U.S. mission in Beijing without a confirmed ambassador at a time when the two countries are at loggerheads over everything from China's new security law in Hong Kong to handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic and over territorial matters in the South China Sea.
That gap could last for months even if Trump is re-elected on Nov. 3. The Senate is only scheduled to be in session for about two more weeks before Election Day. 
The Chinese foreign ministry has in the past described Branstad, who was instrumental in a so-called Phase One trade deal with China, as an ""old friend of the Chinese people"". He first forged ties with President Xi Jinping several decades ago when Xi visited Iowa.

Last week, the United States and China traded attacks about who best understands press freedom after the official People's Daily refused to publish an article by Branstad.

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Ten Tanzanian schoolchildren were killed when a dormitory at a privately-owned primary school in the north of the country caught fire, a senior government official said on Monday.
Police, the fire department and other government officials have started an investigation into the fire, the cause of which is unknown, Marco Gaguti, the regional commissioner for Kagera, told Reuters by phone.
""This dormitory was housing 74 pupils and when it caught fire the pupils started fleeing, but due to the impact of the fire some couldn't make it on time,"" Gaguti said.
Seven other children suffered from burns during the inferno, which started before midnight.
Police are working with relatives of the pupils to identify the charred bodies, Gaguti said, adding that investigators are expected to establish the source of the fire in the next 14 days. 
Mbaraka Mahmoud, the chairman of Itera village where the school is located, said he was woken up after midnight. When he dashed to the scene of the inferno, he found villagers struggling to stop the fire which had engulfed a large part of the dormitory.
A roll call of the students later showed some pupils were missing, prompting rescuers to start digging through the black rubble and burnt iron sheets to find the bodies, he said.
""It is a sad day in our village. Parents, relatives and villagers are devastated,"" Mahmoud said.
Twelve secondary school students were killed in 2009 when a fire razed a dormitory in Iringa, a region located in the central area of the East African nation.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The number of excess deaths in Russia between May and July was more than three times higher than the official coronavirus toll, recent government data show, a discrepancy some experts say raises questions about the accuracy of Moscow's counting.
While Russia has confirmed the world's fourth largest tally of coronavirus cases, it has a relatively low death toll from the associated disease, COVID-19.
Moscow says the way it classifies deaths is more accurate than other nations. Some Russian health officials have explained that in many cases, a patient who dies with COVID-19 does not necessarily die of it but from other causes including pre-existing health problems.
Tatiana Golikova, the head of Russia's coronavirus crisis centre, told President Vladimir Putin in late July that Russia's coronavirus mortality rate was ""significantly lower than in a range of other countries"".
But data released by the Rosstat State Statistics Service on Sept. 4 show there were 57,800 excess deaths between May and July, the peak of the outbreak.
The figure was calculated by comparing fatalities over those three months in 2020 with the average number of May-July deaths between 2015 and 2019. The excess total is more than three times greater than the official May-July COVID-19 death toll of 15,955.
Alexei Raksha, a demographer who worked for Rosstat until this summer, said the jump in Russian deaths illustrated the real toll from COVID-19, and that authorities had reported only some of the deaths publicly.
""In fact, the fatality rate in Russia differs only a little from other countries,"" said Raksha.
The Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment on why excess deaths outnumbered those attributed to COVID-19 and whether the government was playing down the real death toll.
Russia's coronavirus crisis centre said it only reports daily confirmed deaths from coronavirus and referred Reuters to revised data from Rosstat, which showed COVID-19 may have caused several thousand more fatalities than initially reported because in some cases the cause of death had not been established.
But it added: ""We repeatedly found a lower fatality rate from the novel coronavirus in Russia than in the world, which was at 2.8%, including in the May-July period,"" it said.
Excess deaths, which some epidemiologists say are the best way to measure the true toll from COVID-19 given that counting methods vary between countries, surpass official COVID-19 deaths in many countries.
In Russia, they surpass the number of COVID-19 deaths by a factor of 3.6 for the months in question. Raksha and some opposition figures have criticised Putin for downplaying the pandemic.
In absolute terms, the figure of nearly 60,000 excess deaths from May to July is comparable with the United Kingdom, Europe's worst-hit country. Russia's population of 145 million is, however, more than twice that of the UK.
If total Russian deaths from COVID-19 were close to 60,000, it would make it the fifth largest national total globally, from 12th currently, according to Reuters data.
Some medics say the coronavirus pandemic has led to an increase in deaths from other causes, because people were too scared to go to hospital with unrelated health issues or they were turned away by wards overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.
'NOT OVER SOON'
Mortality figures in some European countries returned towards normal levels in June, but excess deaths in Russia rose from June to July.
In May there were 14,200 excess deaths, 12,200 in June and 31,400 in July, according to Rosstat. Figures for August have not yet been released.
Economist Nikolai Kulbaka of the state-funded Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration said the coronavirus initially spread more slowly because of the low level of movement within the country.
""There are regions where the coronavirus will come much later. This won't be over soon,"" he said.
At the beginning of the crisis, Russia introduced new fines and jail terms for anyone who spread information seen as false, which state media says was a measure against fake news about the pandemic.
Raksha, who worked for Russia's state statistics service, said he came under pressure from his former employer's security department after he publicly challenged the official coronavirus statistics. He said he was forced to leave his job in July.
""I was threatened with a criminal case,"" he said.
Rosstat said Raksha left his job of his own accord. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the circumstances of his departure.

""Rosstat believes that ... expression of views of its employees in the press is an advantage for the organization because it allows (us) to show the potential of state statistics,"" it said in response to a request for comment.

The deaths of 18-month-old Ali Dawabsheh and his parents Saad and Riham in the village of Duma contributed to a surge of Israeli-Palestinian violence after peace talks stalled in 2014.
Amiram Ben-Uliel, 21 at the time of the killings, was convicted in May of three counts of murder and two charges of attempted murder in what a court determined were racially-motivated crimes.
Israel's Shin Bet internal security service, which had interrogated Ben-Uliel, hailed that verdict as ""an important milestone in the struggle against Jewish terrorism"".
But Palestinians see Israel as sluggish in cracking down on Jewish militants, compared with the speedy and sometimes lethal response by security forces to violence by Arabs.
On Monday, a district court in Lod in central Israel sentenced Ben-Uliel to three consecutive life terms for the murders and another 20 years for the attempted murders.
Ben-Uliel firebombed the Dawabsheh family home and another dwelling in Duma after spray-painting “Revenge” and “Long Live King Messiah” on their walls, the Lod court found. 
Another Dawabsheh son, Ahmed, survived with severe burns.
Ben-Uliel has said he intends to appeal the conviction.
""He asserts his innocence and contends the confession was extracted through torture,"" Ben-Uliel's attorney, Itzak Bam, told Reuters.
But the court's ruling said his confession included details from the arson scene that only a perpetrator could know. He was acquitted of a charge of belonging to a terrorist organisation.
A second, underage defendant in the case was convicted as an accessory as part of a plea bargain. His sentence is pending.

Israeli officials say investigations into Duma and other attacks by Jewish militants against Palestinians have been hampered by the suspects’ operating in tight-knit cells and eluding electronic surveillance.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A prominent Bahraini lawyer was handed a six-month suspended prison sentence on Monday for inciting sectarianism, in a case rights groups say erodes defence lawyers' freedom of speech.
Abdullah al-Shamlawi, who has represented dozens of political prisoners, including opposition leaders, told Reuters the court overturned a previous sentence of eight months in prison, issued by a criminal court earlier this year.
Shamlawi was charged with ""inciting hatred of a religious sect"" and ""misusing a telecommunications device"", after tweeting critical views on religious practices related to Ashura, a holy festival in the Shi'ite Muslim calendar, court documents showed.
The appeals court sentenced Shamlawi on the charge of inciting religious hatred and dropped charges of misusing a telecommunications device, he said.
Shamlawi, who has been free on bail pending his appeal, was also banned from practicing law for one month. 
Mass trials became commonplace in the kingdom - home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet - after a failed uprising in 2011 led by members of the population's Shi'ite majority.
Since then, the country has seen sporadic clashes between protesters and security forces, who have been targeted by bomb attacks.
Rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD), have called on Bahraini authorities to drop the charges against Shamlawi and other lawyers.
Abdullah Hashim, another defence lawyer, was charged with spreading ""fake news"" last year, after tweeting about alleged government corruption and other political issues in Bahrain. 
The government denies repressing the opposition and says it is protecting national security from groups it calls terrorists backed by Iran.

""That al-Shamlawi was ever brought to trial for these bogus charges demonstrates the judicial harassment faced by Bahraini lawyers who refuse to toe the government line,"" said Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of BIRD.

658,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 10:01AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Russian paramedics' accounts challenge Moscow's explanation for Navalny's coma - sources,"By Anton Zverev and Gleb Stolyarov
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The paramedics who treated Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny after he fell violently ill on a plane last month found no increase in his blood sugar in initial tests and saw no signs of a metabolic disorder, five medical sources, speaking out for the first time, told Reuters.
Their accounts contradict the public diagnosis given by the doctors at Emergency Hospital No. 1 in Omsk, where he was treated, who said Navalny had fallen into a coma due to a metabolic disorder and experienced blood sugar levels four times higher than normal.
Three sources with knowledge of Navalny's initial treatment by four paramedics before he was taken off the plane and at the airfield said glucometry, a glucose test, showed his blood sugar was 3-5 mmol (millimoles) per litre - within normal limits.
""There was no diabetes there, it was all checked at once and ruled out,"" one of the sources said. ""The indicator was normal, there was no problem in carbohydrate metabolism."" Reuters did not independently review the results of the tests administered by the paramedics.
Two other sources, also aware of his treatment at the airfield, told Reuters that Navalny's blood sugar was not abnormal. Four of the five sources said the paramedics who saw Navalny observed a clinical picture of poisoning, with symptoms including stupor rather than any signs of a metabolic disorder.
""It was indescribable. Navalny was in a stupor, a state of confused consciousness, he could not explain anything,"" said one of the sources, who had knowledge of his treatment at the airfield.
Germany, where Navalny was taken for further treatment after two days of treatment in Omsk, has said he had been poisoned by Russia with a rare nerve agent, Novichok. Berlin has demanded an explanation from Moscow, amid calls for sanctions. The Kremlin has said the accusations are ""groundless"" and that it has seen no evidence of poisoning.
Contacted for comment on the accounts of the paramedics' findings, Alexander Sabaev, chief toxicologist of Omsk's Emergency Hospital No. 1, disputed them.
""No, this is not true, the ambulance team saw sugar 13 mmol per litre,"" he said. ""Metabolic parameters can only be found by biochemical analysis, which can only be done in a hospital.""
A sugar level of 13 mmol per litre is well above normal.
Sabaev said further that Navalny had a ""tendency to coma"" and noted the paramedics did not administer atropine, a drug used when particular kinds of poisoning are suspected.
Three sources who said the paramedics saw clinical signs of poisoning said they gave him some unspecified injections to treat his symptoms but did not give atropine on the airfield because they did not suspect that kind of poisoning.
Sabaev said last week he had initially suspected poisoning because of what the paramedics and Navalny's allies had told him and gave Navalny a small dose of atropine to treat a problem with his lungs once he was in the hospital..
Some medical sources have said that probably saved Navalny's life, due to his critical condition. Atropine is used widely in emergency situations, including to treat the effects of pesticides or nerve agents such as Novichok, the banned substance Berlin said it found in Navalny's body.
In his same public comments last week, Sabaev said he had changed his mind about poisoning after receiving laboratory test results that he said did not show any sign of toxins.
HIGH STAKES
The information battle over what happened to Navalny has serious implications for relations between Russia and the West.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has come under pressure to halt the nearly-completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will take gas from Russia to Germany.
The Kremlin has asked Germany to provide evidence of poisoning. Berlin state prosecutors announced on Friday they would hand over information if Navalny, who is emerging from the coma, agreed.
Asked to comment on the accounts of the paramedics' observations and the initial test results, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters he did not have information on ""what kind of tests were taken from the patient by the doctors who met him at the plane, whether they took any tests at all and who these doctors are"".
An outspoken opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Navalny was taken ill on Aug. 20 when he collapsed on a domestic flight. Before boarding, he drank a cup of tea that his allies say was poisoned.
The paramedics at the airport in Omsk received a message from the pilot of the plane via air traffic control that a passenger with likely poisoning was on board, and based the therapy on this diagnosis, three sources said. Three sources said those with Navalny told the crew it must have been poisoning. Reuters was unable to reach the pilot or air traffic control for comment.
In the first 12 minutes after landing, the paramedics ruled out possible diabetic coma and stroke, they added.
""They worked by a method of elimination, excluded all those diagnoses that are now being voiced,"" said one of the sources.
Anastasia Vasilyeva, Navalny's ally and his doctor for the past several years, said the politician had never had metabolic problems and his sugar levels were normal.
""He is a healthy man, he did not have any serious abnormalities at all,"" Vasilyeva told Reuters.
A source who observed the process of Navalny's treatment in Omsk Emergency Hospital No. 1 said that the dozen or so clinicians treating him were in no doubt. ""Everyone was sure that this was poisoning, the clinical picture was like this,"" the source said.
The hospital did not immediately respond to questions sent on Saturday morning about this description of the medical team's conclusions.
The regional health ministry, which oversees Emergency Hospital No. 1, reiterated that Navalny had high blood sugar levels and had been diagnosed with a metabolic disorder once hospital tests were complete.
Navalny is now being treated in Berlin's Charite hospital, which has said he was suffering from ""severe poisoning"". Asked about the sugar level in his blood and whether he had a metabolic disorder, a spokesperson for the hospital said: ""We do not comment on 'assumptions and speculations'"".
One source at the Omsk Emergency Hospital No. 1 told Reuters the order to release Navalny and let him be airlifted to Germany came directly from the Kremlin, with no reason given.
""We were sitting in the office (in the hospital) when a call came from the Kremlin and they said to release the patient ... and the work started,"" the source said. ""Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.""

Kremlin spokesman Peskov denied the account. ""No. This is not true,"" he said. ""The presidential administration does not supervise doctors either in Omsk or in other cities of our country.""

KABUL (Reuters) - As Taliban and Afghan government negotiators met for long-awaited peace talks in Qatar, around 50 families gathered at a graveyard in Kabul on Monday imploring them not to forget the rights of victims of violence.
Demonstrating families gathered at a cemetery where many of the victims of a 2018 bomb attack at a school in west Kabul were buried. 
One boy cried next to the grave of a classmate, another waved a banner reading in Dari: ""Who represents the victims in peace negotiations?""
Historic peace talks kicked off in Qatar's capital, Doha, on Saturday after months of delays in U.S.-led efforts to end 19 years of conflict that the United Nations estimates has killed and wounded more than 100,000 civilians.
Many of those gathered at the graveyard, some by the graves of their loved ones, called for lasting peace, but also wanted recognition of the toll violence had taken on civilians.
Raihana Hashemi, 28, whose sister was killed in a separate 2018 incident in which protesters were shot near a school, said that around two months ago she and other families had created a ""National War Victims Network"" to elevate concerns they were being forgotten during the peace process. 
""Come and admit that they have committed a crime, apologise to the families of the victims,"" she said, saying the group represented people whose loved ones had been killed by both warring sides. ""Pay financial and moral compensation to the families of the victims,"" she added.
Mah Jan, whose son was killed in a suicide attack in Kabul, said that the peace process desperately needed to deliver permanent results. 

""I would only forgive my son's killing if I could witness a lasting peace in the country,"" she said.

Iranian state media reported Afkari's execution on Saturday. Afkari, a champion Greco-Roman wrestler, had been convicted of stabbing a security guard to death during anti-government protests in 2018.
Afkari's family has maintained that his conviction depended on a confession that was extracted through torture, which Afkari later recanted. The Iranian judiciary rejected his appeals.
""The European Union is opposed to the death penalty under all circumstances and cases with no exception,"" a spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement.
""Human rights remain a central feature of our engagement with Iran. We will continue to engage with Iranian authorities on this issue including through the local EU representation in Tehran and also on individual cases such as this recent execution,"" he said.
Iran's foreign ministry on Monday summoned Germany's envoy to ""strongly protest"" against the condemning of Afkari's execution in comments on Twitter, the state news agency IRNA reported, saying the post was considered by Tehran to be interference in the Islamic Republic's internal affairs. 

The United States, which unlike the EU practises the death penalty, has also condemned Afkari's execution. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called it ""an outrageous assault on human dignity, even by the despicable standards of this regime"".

HAVANA/LOME (Reuters) - At the start of Togo's coronavirus outbreak, the small West African nation welcomed a team of 12 Cuban healthcare workers to tend to sufferers of the virus, boost its laboratory testing and help improve its hospital protocols.
While the virus was overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide, the Communist-run Caribbean island boasted a rare resource: a surplus of doctors trained in deploying abroad and battling infectious disease. 
And it was willing to dispatch them all over the globe to nations requesting help.
""As scientific and medical circles groped in the dark, Cuban medicine, strong from past experiences, brought appropriate answers,"" said the head of cooperation at Togo's foreign ministry, Charles Azilan.
Nearly 40 countries across five continents have received Cuban medics during the pandemic, as the island nation - home to just over 11 million inhabitants - has once more punched far above its weight in medical diplomacy.
Since its 1959 leftist revolution, Cuba has dispatched its ""army of white coats"" to disaster sites and disease outbreaks around the world in the name of solidarity. In the last decade, they have fought cholera in Haiti and Ebola in West Africa.
Not that its brigades are purely altruistic. Cuba has exported doctors on more routine missions in exchange for cash or goods in recent decades, making them its top source of hard currency. 
While some countries have received the medics for free during the pandemic, others are paying: a slight boon to Cuba's economy struggling with the coronavirus-induced collapse in tourism.
Togo's government, like many others in the past, has praised the brigades as an example of south-south cooperation, calling it a ""turning point"" in their relations. 
Yet even wealthy, western nations like Andorra and Italy have welcomed Cuban medics to help fight the pandemic, as have countries that are not politically aligned with Cuba, such as Peru. 
The success of the medics has been a setback for the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which launched an unprecedented campaign against Cuba's medical missions in recent years, citing what it calls their exploitative labor conditions.
Havana dismisses the U.S. attacks as ideologically-driven.
Cuba experts say while some of the U.S. criticism was legitimate, it ultimately aimed to strangle the island's economy to foment change and woo anti-Castro voters in the swing state of Florida ahead of November's U.S. presidential election.
But Washington was ""almost totally isolated"" on its Cuba policy, said Paul Hare, a former British ambassador to the island who lectures at Boston University's Pardee School of Global Studies, while its ""America First"" strategy contrasted unfavorably with Cuba's medical diplomacy. 
Several Caribbean nations complained for example in April of U.S. customs blocking shipments of medical supplies to them even as the region was welcoming hundreds of Cuban doctors.
REVOLUTIONARY DOCTORS
With financial aid from its former ally the Soviet Union, Cuba built up a healthcare system that was the envy of the developing world under the leadership of the late Fidel Castro. 
Some of those advances have been lost since the communist bloc collapsed. Many hospitals are run down, medicines are in short supply and Cubans complain about a decline in the quality of medical training.
Still, Cuba has one of the highest ratios of physicians per capita in the world and even before pandemic struck, had some 28,000 medics deployed globally. It has since dispatched a further 4,000. 
""They are lifesavers,"" said Ralph Gonsalves, prime minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and chairman of the Caribbean bloc CARICOM. ""In some Caribbean countries, they constitute the backbone of the response to the pandemic."" 
Jamaica for example welcomed 137 Cuban doctors in March, in addition to the 296 already practicing there.
""Without them, it would have been very much harder for us,"" said Jamaica's chief nursing officer, Patricia Ingram-Martin.
Host countries say they have sought to learn from Cuba's handling of the pandemic back home: isolating cases, tracing their contacts, screening for sufferers and swiftly applying therapeutic treatments like the antiviral agent interferon.
Cuba has reported just 4,684 cases and 108 deaths so far: a tenth of the global average per capita.
Many of the doctors on the frontlines of the battle against coronavirus in the global South are also graduates of Cuba's international medicine school in Havana, which has trained an estimated 30,000 foreigners.
HUMAN TRAFFICKING?
The Trump administration has denounced Havana for typically retaining 75% or more of what host countries pay for its doctors - likening the brigades to human trafficking.
The Cuban government compares what it retains to a tax that goes to funding its universal healthcare system. 
Human Rights Watch has also criticized what it calls repressive working conditions including Cuban doctors being banned from returning home for eight years if they defect.
Conservative governments in Brazil, Bolivia and Ecuador have ended their agreements with Cuba in recent years, amid allegations in the latter two countries that the doctors also interfered in domestic politics - charges Havana denies.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson told Reuters it applauded those countries as well as nations like Barbados that sought to ensure Cuban medics receive direct payments and rights guarantees while working there. 
Cuban doctors told Reuters that while they would like better conditions, the missions allow them to earn significantly more than their $70-$100 monthly salary at home.
Sending home the doctors, many of whom work in remote, poor regions which struggle to attract local medics, comes at a cost, particularly to the most vulnerable, analysts say.
Brazil, hard hit by the pandemic, has re-hired 1,012 Cuban doctors who elected to stay in the country, allowing them to work in basic primary medicine for two years without having to requalify to practise.
Just four have been re-hired in Brasilia, which used to have 70. Tania Ribeiro, a nurse in a poor neighborhood of the capital, said the Cuban doctors who had left were sorely missed. 
    ""They were warm and charismatic. The patients loved them,"" she said.
Carlos Dorado, director of a hospital in the northern Bolivian town of Guayaramerin, said it especially missed the Cuban doctor who had been its only intensive care therapist.
""Now we just don't have one, although that's what you most need with COVID,"" he said.

LEH, India (Reuters) - Two Indian officials said Chinese troops were laying a network of optical fibre cables at a western Himalayan flashpoint with India, suggesting they were digging in for the long haul despite high-level talks aimed at resolving a standoff there.
Such cables, which would provide forward troops with secure lines of communication to bases in the rear, have recently been spotted to the south of Pangong Tso lake in the Himalayan region of Ladakh, a senior government official said.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to questions on the matter from Reuters, while defence officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
Thousands of Indian and Chinese troops backed by tanks and aircraft are locked in an uneasy stalemate along a 70 km-long front to the south of the lake. Each country has accused the other of escalating the standoff.
A third Indian official said on Monday that there had been no significant withdrawals or reinforcements on either side since the foreign ministers of the two countries met last week.
""It is as tense as earlier,"" he said.
Above Leh, Ladakh's main city, Indian fighter planes flew throughout the morning, their engines booming and echoing across the valley surrounded by brown, barren mountains.
""Our biggest worry is that they have laid optical fibre cables for high-speed communications,"" the first official said, referring to the lake's southern bank, where Indian and Chinese troops are only a few hundred metres apart at some points.
""They have been laying optical fibre cables on the southern bank at breakneck speed,"" he said.
Indian intelligence agencies noted similar cables to the north of the Pangong Tso lake around a month ago, the second government official said.
The first Indian government official said the authorities were alerted to such activity after satellite imagery showed unusual lines in the sand of the high-altitude deserts to the south of Pangong Tso.
These lines were judged by Indian experts - and corroborated by foreign intelligence agencies - to be communication cables laid in trenches, he said, including near the Spanggur gap, among hilltops where soldiers fired in the air recently for the first time in decades.
Indian officials say a build-up in border infrastructure on their side is also likely to have played a part in the months-long confrontation.
The Chinese have complained about India building roads and air strips in and around their disputed border, and Beijing says this triggered tensions along the border.
A former Indian military intelligence official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said optical fibre cables offered communications security as well as the ability to send data such as pictures and documents.
""If you speak on radio, it can get caught. Communications on optical fibre cables is secure,"" he said.

The Indian military still depends on radio communications, the first official said, although he said it was encrypted.

The deaths shocked Britain and Vietnam and shone a spotlight on the illicit global trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West.
The defendants, aged between 24 and 36, were found guilty of ""organising and brokering illegal emigration"", after a one-day trial in the central province of Ha Tinh, Pham Van Thin, the father of one of the victims, told Reuters.
The victims, who included two 15-year-old boys, were mostly from Ha Tinh and its neighbouring Nghe An province, where poor job prospects, encouragement by authorities, smuggling gangs and environmental issues have fuelled migration. 
They were discovered last October in a container at the back of a truck on an industrial estate in Grays in Essex, about 20 miles (30 km) east of London.
A police statement said earlier on Monday the defendants arranged for Pham Thi Tra My, whose desperate text messages sent from inside the container first alerted the world to the victims' plight, to travel illegally to France and then to Britain for $22,000. 
My, 26, was found dead with the 38 other victims in the container.
""I honestly don't want the defendants to face long prison sentences as I know that it was just an accident,"" said Thin, Tra My's father, who attended the trial. 
""Handing them long prison terms won't help me get back my daughter,"" Thin said. 
Last month, a 40-year-old Irish haulier, Ronan Hughes, became the second man to plead guilty over his involvement in the case. The other was Maurice Robinson from Northern Ireland, who was driving the truck when the bodies were found.
A third man, Eamonn Harrison, 23, also from Northern Ireland, pleaded not guilty to the same charges. A trial is due to begin on Oct. 5.

More than 12,000 people, mostly refugees from Afghanistan, Africa and Syria, are without shelter and are having to sleep out in the open without proper sanitation after the fire tore through the Moria migrant camp last Wednesday.
Greece is now registering the migrants and testing them for the COVID-19 disease before channeling them into the temporary tent camp, government spokesman Stelios Petsas said, though a police officer said some were refusing to move to the facility.
""We expect that in the next three to four days all will be housed, a bit less than the (total number of) roughly 12,000 homeless,"" he told reporters.
Authorities have already moved some 400 minors from the island to the Greek mainland since the blaze for possible resettlement in other European countries. 
About 600 migrants have so far been resettled in the temporary tent camp and 14 of them have tested positive for COVID-19, a government official said.
In the chaos following last week's fire, authorities lost sight of 35 people who had tested positive, deepening fears of an outbreak among migrants sleeping closely together without proper sanitation.
Petsas repeated on Monday the government's suspicion that the fire was started deliberately ""by migrants who wanted to blackmail the government to leave the island"". An investigation into the cause of the blaze is continuing.
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Sunday that Greece would build a permanent new migrant reception centre to replace the Moria facility.

Germany's Bild newspaper reported on Monday that Berlin is considering taking in thousands of refugees from Lesbos as a one-off gesture and also wants the Moria camp to be rebuilt and run by the European Union.

HANOI (Reuters) - A Vietnamese court sentenced two brothers to death and handed prison terms or probation to 27 others on Monday, for their roles in the high-profile killings of three policemen in a clash over land rights, the security ministry and a lawyer said.
Le Dinh Cong and Le Dinh Chuc were charged with murder and resisting law enforcement before their tightly guarded trial. Twenty-seven others received punishments ranging from probation to 16 years or life imprisonment. 
The brothers' father, Le Dinh Kinh, 83, was shot dead by police during the January clash at Dong Tam, a small rice-farming community next to a military air base, where authorities attempted to build a wall that the villagers said encroached on their land. 
Land disputes are a longstanding issue in Vietnam, where rows over who has the legal right to build on land, most of which the state owns, can often spill into protests.
The Dong Tam dispute has yet to be resolved. It came to a head on Jan. 8, when police shot and killed Kinh, a village elder and retired local official. Villagers said police raided the village and killed Kinh in his bedroom.
Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security said the three policemen were burnt to death by villagers armed with hand grenades, petrol bombs, knives and bricks in a pre-planned attack.
A ministry statement after the verdict said the defendants' acts were ""extremely dangerous for society and seriously violated legitimate state activities"".
Lawyer Ha Huy Son told Reuters that of the two sentenced to death, Chuc had pleaded guilty but brother Cong denied the charges and would appeal.
""The case still has some unresolved issues, including how exactly the policemen were killed,"" Son added.
Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said the trial was far from independent and intended to send a message. 
""Vietnam's rulers are bending over backwards to show their toughest possible face,"" he said. ""Because they worry this community's defiance could be contagious."" 

Ming Yu Hah of Amnesty International called it ""a blatantly unfair trial"".

Under the plan, the CDU's executive committee and board would meet on Dec. 3, with the congress held on Dec. 4. Party laws stipulate that the CDU must elect a new leader this year.
Originally, the CDU planned a three-day meeting but the coronavirus pandemic forced a rethink.

LISBON (Reuters) - Wearing masks and trying to keep a safe distance, more than a million pupils returned to schools across Portugal on Monday, a long-awaited moment for many after students were forced in March to learn remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
At the Maria Amalia high school in Lisbon teenagers were called into the classroom one by one and asked to disinfect their hands, while windows were left open.
Standing next to her son as they waited outside, Alexandra Borges said she feared there would be new infections at school but going back to in-person classes was essential for pupils of all ages, including her son Pedro, who brought hand sanitizer inside his backpack.
""It was a little hard because I have a son with special needs which makes things even more complicated,"" she said of the home-schooling period. ""There were various kids who were depressed, full of desire to go back to school."" 
Portugal ordered schools, kindergartens and universities to close in mid-March when a lockdown was imposed to fight the spread of the coronavirus. Classes were replaced with online lessons and daily TV broadcasts of various subjects.
    ""It was hard on everyone because all of a sudden, without expecting it, we had to stay home,"" said Fatima Lopes, principal at the Maria Amalia school.
    ""We are all trying to do better,"" Lopes said. ""I doubt we can do it in an exemplary way right from the beginning.""
The number of daily infections has increased in Portugal since the end of the lockdown and is now around the levels last seen in April.
    Chemistry teacher Helena Teixeira said one of the biggest challenges will be being unable to stand close to her students and give them personalised support. 

    ""It will be a very serious problem,"" Teixeira said as her students sat quietly behind her. ""(But) I'm always happy to be with them.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian police arrested a former student leader on Monday for his alleged role in deadly riots in the capital New Delhi earlier this year, to the anger of rights activists. 
Umar Khalid, a former student politician who has frequently criticised the Indian government, is accused of being a ""conspirator"" in communal riots in Delhi in February that left over 50 people dead and thousands displaced. 
Khalid was arrested after 11 hours of interrogation by the elite ""special cell"" of Delhi's police force, according to a statement published on his official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page in the early hours of Monday morning. 
""The fairytale narrative that (Delhi Police) has been spinning, criminalising protests in the garb of investigating riots, find(s) yet another victim,"" the statement said.
Anil Mittal, a Delhi police spokesman, did not respond to a request for comment, and Khalid could not be reached for comment. 
Kunal Kamra, a high-profile comedian and activist, said in a tweet he was ""shattered, broken, helpless and tired"" after Khalid's arrest. 
The Hindu-Muslim riots in February followed several months of protests - some of which turned violent - against a new citizenship law that critics say discriminates against India's minority Muslims. 
India's federal government, led by Hindu-nationalist prime minister Narendra Modi, rejects this, saying the laws are required to safeguard the rights of religious minorities in South Asia. 
In one affected area in Delhi, where two large mosques and dozens of Muslim houses surrounding it were torched, houses with Hindu symbols on them were largely left untouched. Some 2,000 people are believed to have been displaced, the overwhelming majority of them Muslim.
The government has largely blamed Muslims and left-wing activists for the violence before and during the riots, including members of an opposition party currently governing Delhi.

MOSCOW/TOMSK (Reuters) - The ruling United Russia party secured landslide wins at weekend regional elections but lost its majority in a Siberian city council contested by supporters of stricken Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, partial results showed on Monday. 
Supporters of the opposition politician, who is being treated in Berlin after a suspected poisoning by a nerve agent, made rare gains in the Siberian city of Tomsk and won seats in the city of Novosibirsk along with other opposition groups.
But pro-Kremlin politicians backed by President Vladimir Putin won, or were heading for landslide wins, to serve as the governors of more than a dozen regions including Komi, Tatarstan and Kamchatka, partial results showed.
They confirmed the overall dominance of United Russia, which supports Putin, but showed a perceptible uptick in opposition support in parts of Siberia where Navalny had focused his attention before the suspected poisoning on Aug. 20.
Germany said on Monday that laboratories in three countries had now confirmed the use of the Novichok nerve agent, and renewed its demand for an explanation from Russia. Moscow has called the accusation groundless and said it has seen no evidence.
Navalny had promoted a tactical voting strategy to challenge United Russia and disrupt a political system in which outspoken Kremlin critics are often barred from competing.
As he lay in hospital for the past several weeks, his allies pressed ahead with the strategy, naming more than 1,000 politicians they thought were well placed to beat ruling party candidates and urging Russians to vote for them.
In Tomsk, a vibrant student town that was Navalny's last campaign stop, at least 16 of those candidates won. United Russia secured no more than 11 out of 37 seats in the city council, partial results showed. 
""People are sick of the authorities. You can't sit on the throne for 20 years, grab, steal endlessly, do all of this and go unpunished,"" said Ksenia Fadeyeva, one of two Navalny allies to win a council seat in Tomsk.
Navalny supporter Andrei Fateev, 32, also won a seat in Tomsk. Sergei Boyko, another ally of Navalny, won a seat on the council in Novosibirsk. 
In that city, United Russia was heading for 22 out of 50 seats in the assembly, the Interfax news agency cited results as saying. It had held 33 seats. 
But Dmitry Asantsev, a United Russia official, said three independents had joined the party's fraction in Novosibirsk giving it a slender majority there, the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper reported. 
Elsewhere, United Russia looked to have maintained its grip on power and was on course to retain majorities in an array of regional legislative assemblies. Local elections took place in nearly all of Russia's regions. 

The independent Golos election watchdog said it had received more than 1,000 complaints alleging violations at polling stations and that monitors had faced restrictions in their work.

POCONÉ, Brazil (Reuters) - A fire has been burning since mid-July in the remote wetlands of west-central Brazil, leaving in its wake a vast charred desolation bigger than New York City.
A team of veterinarians, biologists and local guides arrived in late August to prowl the bumpy dirt road known as the Trans-Pantanal Highway in pickup trucks, looking to save what injured animals they could. 
Jaguars were wandering the blackened wasteland, they said, starving or going thirsty, with paws burnt to the bone, lungs blackened by smoke. They saw bodies of alligator-like caiman, jaws frozen in silent screams, the last act of creatures desperate to cool off before being consumed by flames. 
This massive fire is one of thousands of blazes sweeping the Brazilian Pantanal - the world's largest wetland - this year in what climate scientists fear could become a new normal, echoing the rise in climate-driven fires from California to Australia.
The Pantanal is smaller and less-known than its famous cousin, the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) jungle. But the region's normally abundant waters and strategic location - sandwiched between the rainforest, Brazil's vast grasslands and Paraguay's dry forests - make it a magnet for animals.
The fires are now threatening one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, biologists say. The Pantanal is home to roughly 1,200 vertebrate animal species, including 36 that are threatened with extinction. Across this usually lush landscape of 150,000 square kilometers (57,915 square miles) in Brazil, rare birds flutter and the world's densest population of jaguars roam. 
Fire is not new here. For decades, ranchers have used flames to cheaply return nutrients to the soil and renew pasture for their beef cattle. But those blazes, fueled by drought, now burn with historic force, racing across desiccated vegetation. The biggest fires in the Pantanal this year are quadruple the size of the largest fire in Brazil's Amazon rainforest, NASA satellites show.
A record 23,490 square kilometers have burned through Sept. 6 - nearly 16% of the Brazilian Pantanal, according to a Federal University of Rio de Janeiro analysis.
Last month, Reuters witnessed a fire that flashed from forest to pasture near the tourist gateway of Poconé in Brazil's Mato Grosso state. The rush of air sucked in by the blaze spun a strong wind into a tornado of smoke. The temperature on the ground soared to 46.5 Celsius (115.7 Fahrenheit). 
Dorvalino Conceição Camargo, a 56-year-old farmhand in a straw hat common among local cowboys, helped beat back the flames.
Sweating from the effort, Camargo said he had never seen fires this bad. 
""Everything is suffering,"" he said. 
THE FLOODS NEVER CAME 
The Pantanal is known for being wet, not dry. The world's largest flood plain normally fills with several feet of water during the rainy season from around November to April each year.
Camargo recalled navigating the waters as a child in boxy canoes. Back on the ranch where he works, he showed the farm's high-water mark - 70 centimeters (2.3 feet) off the ground - hewn into the post of a cattle corral. Even in a dry year it's typically about half that, he said.
This year, the floods never came. Only a little bit of water pooled in a ditch nearby, he said. Now as water evaporates in the dry season, the Paraguay River that traverses the Pantanal has receded to its lowest point since 1973, according to Julia Arieira, a climate researcher at Brazil's Federal University of Espirito Santo.
Scientists blame the drought on warming in the Atlantic Ocean just above the equator that's drawing moisture away from South America and will send it north, likely in the form of stronger hurricanes. 
NASA scientist Doug Morton said this phenomenon is caused by shifts in ocean temperature known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation - the Atlantic Ocean's equivalent of El Niño in the Pacific. Unlike El Niño, which typically happens every 2-7 years, the oscillation alternates between hot and cold roughly every 30-40 years.
When it runs hot, as it has been since the 1990s, the warming in the tropical North Atlantic is more likely to occur, contributing to South American droughts and fires.
Changing ocean temperatures are ""a likely driver of the dry conditions we've seen so far this year in the Pantanal,"" according to Morton, who leads NASA's biospheric sciences lab.
Morton said the warm spot could also be contributing to more dryness in the southern part of the Amazon, where fires likely hit a 10-year high in August; and in Argentina's wetlands where the blazes are the worst since 2009.
More worrying still, Morton is concerned global warming could disrupt the Oscillation and leave it permanently in the warm phase, contributing to more fires.
Even if that does not happen, scientists fear global temperature increases on their own would make vast burning ever more common.
Destruction of the Amazon rainforest to the north is exacerbating drought in the Pantanal over the long-term, said Philip Fearnside, an ecologist at Brazil's National Institute of Amazonian Research. That's because jungle trees recycle rain and push the moisture back into the air as water vapor, which winds then carry to neighboring regions in so-called flying rivers. 
Amazon deforestation has surged 34.5% in the 12 months through July, compared to the same period a year ago, according to preliminary data from government space research agency Inpe.
Under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil has also weakened environmental enforcement.
Bolsonaro's press office directed questions to the Environment Ministry, which did not respond to a request for comment. 
Environment Minister Ricardo Salles visited the Pantanal in August, saying that federal environmental agencies had sent five aircraft and additional workers to assist the more than 100 state firefighters battling the blazes.
""The fires are causing great damage to fauna, flora and to the Pantanal region,"" Salles said.
DEAD ANIMALS
No humans have died in the Pantanal fires, according to Mato Grosso state firefighting Lieutenant Colonel Jean Oliveira, who has been leading all government agencies in the fire response.
The victims, he said, are wildlife.
While there aren't exact counts, at a minimum thousands of animals have perished, according to biologist Rogério Rossi at the Federal University of Mato Grosso.
The roving veterinary team is able to save only a tiny fraction of the injured animals. Many of these creatures are difficult to catch, far from accessible roads.
Veterinarian Jorge Salomão Jr. rattled off an inventory of the carnage. 
""We've seen a lot of dead animals, mainly reptiles, serpents, caimans,"" he said. ""We've seen a lot of dead deer, dead tapirs, dead monkeys, dead coati,"" a cousin of North American raccoons.
In the burned expanse of 1,347 square kilometers (520 square miles) near the town of Poconé, dead snakes are seen every few meters.
Local guide Eduarda Fernandes, who is working with the rescue team, wandered the area, feet sinking into the deep soot. 
She picked up a snake petrified in the fire. It had bitten its own flesh, in what a biologist said was likely an involuntary reaction as it sought any escape from the pain of being burned alive.

Asked what she thought happened, Fernandes responded, ""Pain. Despair.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's parliament met for the first time in six months on Monday, as novel coronavirus cases across the country rose by more than 90,000 in the space of a day and the total number of infections neared 5 million.
Members, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, wore masks and sat in seats enclosed by glass partitions designed to prevent the spread of the virus. 
The assembly's hours have been truncated; the lower house will sit in the morning and the upper house in the afternoon.
""There can be no laxity when there is no medicine. We hope that a vaccine is available soon, whichever part of the world it comes from,"" Modi said in remarks to the media before the session began.
Federal Home Minister Amit Shah, Modi's close aide, was absent from Monday's session. He spent most of August in hospital after contracting the virus, and returned to hospital over the weekend for what hospital authorities said was a check-up. 
Infections in India have been rising faster than in any other country and it lags only the United States in total infections.
On Monday, the health ministry said it had recorded 92,071 new cases of the coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 4.85 million.

Deaths have been relatively low compared with the number of infections, but the rate is rising. More than 1,100 people died of COVID-19 in the previous 24 hours, the ministry said, taking the total number of deaths to 79,722.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Sitting in a hair salon as a stylist braids her natural hair, Sana Sebone recalls a time in 2013 when she worked on a construction site and was told her dreadlocks were too long and represented a hazard.
She was upset, she said, mainly because her white colleagues with long hair were not told the same as their hair was considered ""normal"".
Seven years on, that term is haunting her again after an advert was released by TRESemmé, a Unilever (NYSE:UL) brand, describing images of African Black hair as ""frizzy and dull"" and ""dry and damaged"" while a white woman's hair was referred to as ""normal"".
""It really upset me,"" said 30-year-old Sebone, who turned to dreadlocks after tiring of straightening her natural hair to make it look ""presentable"" in others' eyes.
Unilever has apologised for the advert, which it admitted was ""racist"", while TRESemmé South Africa and Drugstore Clicks Group, on whose website the advert was posted, have also apologised.
""We are in the year 2020. How ignorant can you be to still think Black women's natural hair is ugly, is fuzzy and is all those negative words?,"" Sebone said at the salon in Midrand, a suburb in northern Johannesburg.
The advert caused an outcry on social media and sparked protests led by the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters in a country where unfair treatment of people based on their hair evokes painful memories of prejudice during apartheid, which ended in 1994.
In those years, a ""pencil test"" was used to determine someone's racial identity: A pencil was inserted into a person's hair and if it did not fall out, that person was considered not white.
""Our forefathers have fought this. Are we still fighting this? When will it end?,"" said 48-year-old Nomsa Nyathi as she sat under a hair steamer at the salon.
Black hair is still policed in places like schools, where Black girls with natural afros or dreadlocks are sometimes suspended for not ""wearing their hair right"" or are asked to straighten their hair.
""Everything about being a Black female in South Africa or even in the world screams 'You're not good enough, you don't fit in here, you're not wanted here',"" said 42-year-old Ntombenhle Khathwane, founder of Black hair products brand AfroBotanics.
Khathwane herself remembers being told in high school that her dreadlocks did not align with the school's neatness policy.
Unilever has pulled all TRESemmé products from South African retail stores for 10 days. Its South African unit has moved to set up an advisory board and a diversity committee.

Berlin has been facing growing calls from regional and local politicians who have said they would take in people from the camp, which burned down last week, if the federal government allowed them to.
Officials, led by federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, have been reluctant to move unilaterally, saying a European agreement is needed to disperse the camp's more than 12,000 former residents across the European Union.
Citing government and EU sources, Bild said conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel was now leaning towards taking in more refugees, ahead of a meeting with her Social Democrat coalition partners due to take place on Monday.
She, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen aim to build a new refugee camp on Lesbos that would be run by the European Union, Bild reported. Currently, Greece runs the camp.
There was no immediate comment from the government.
The newspaper said the government was likely to agree to take in at least hundreds of children from the camp along with their parents, with thousands also a possibility.
Earlier, Social Democrat Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, told a news conference Germany had to be ready to play a role in taking in refugees, though this could only be a stepping stone to finding a Europe-wide way of housing refugees arriving at Europe's borders.
""It can't stand as it is now, where each time we decide on a case-by-case basis,"" he said.

Bild said Merkel hoped the coalition partners could agree by Wednesday on how many refugees Germany will take.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Sri Lanka has initiated repair work on the ruptured fuel oil tank in the engine room of a stricken fully loaded oil supertanker after plugging the leak, the country's Navy said.
The supertanker is currently 52 nautical miles (96 kms) from the Sri Lankan coast, Navy spokesman Indika de Silva said.
""Salvors are on board, they plugged the leak and the repair is still going...They have vacated the ruptured tank and transferred the dirty water into the ballast section,"" de Silva told Reuters.
A fire broke out in the engine room of the Greek-owned New Diamond tanker on Sept. 3. The ship had left long trails of marine oil slicks.
He said the Sri Lankan Navy and Indian Coast Guard divers on Sunday inspected the vessels and surrounding area for any further leak.
A team of officials from Sri Lanka's Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) visited the tanker on Monday to inspect and collect samples of marine fuel oil from the vessel loaded with about 2 million barrels of oil.
MEPA has said it plans to take action against the ship's owner under the country's laws to protect the marine ecosystem.
Indian Oil Corp, which has chartered the ship to import oil to Paradip in eastern India from Kuwait, is waiting for a salvagers' report expected within a week, its chairman S.M. Vaidya said. 
""We will be looking at salvors' recommendation as to which is the nearest port they can tow the vessel to for ship-to-ship transfer of the oil cargo,"" Vaidya told Reuters.
He said normally ship-to-ship transfer of the cargo doesn't happen in high seas due to rough weather conditions.
Eventually the crude will be taken to Pardip refinery for processing, he added.
De Silva said seven tug boats were engaged to keep a vigil on the vessel and provide support to the salvagers carrying out the repair work.
New Shipping Ltd, the manager of the Panama-flagged New Diamond, has appointed SMIT Singapore Pte Ltd to lead salvage operations.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean prosecutors on Monday indicted the former leader of an advocacy group for victims of Japanese wartime sexual exploitation on charges of fraud and embezzlement.
Yoon Mee-hyang stepped down as head of the Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, better known as Jungdaehyup, this year to launch a successful bid for a seat in parliament, where she now serves as a member of the ruling party.
Since then, she has been dogged by allegations that she used government subsidies for her own benefit, rather than to help the “comfort women” - a Japanese euphemism for those forced to work in Japan’s wartime brothels.
Prosecutors said in a statement, Yoon was charged on eight counts, including illegally receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in government subsidies, spending donations to the non-profit group on personal purchases, and compelling a victim who was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease to donate to the foundation, among other crimes.
Calls to Yoon and to the group she used to lead were not answered, but Yonhap news agency reported that she released a statement expressing regret over the charges, vowing to prove her innocence in court, and apologising for causing controversy.
In May, Lee Yong-soo, a prominent victim and activist, accused Yoon of exploiting the women to garner government funds and public donations while spending little money on them.
The feud threatens to undermine the wartime sexual violence movement, led for decades by Yoon, Lee and Jungdaehyup, which together played a key role in effectively nullifying a 2015 settlement with Japan.
The issue remains a major factor in fraught relations between the two U.S. allies.

The 12 were arrested on Aug. 23 for illegal entry into mainland China after setting off from Hong Kong in a boat bound for self-ruled Taiwan following a crackdown by Beijing on pro-democracy activists in the former British colony.
The failed bid by the 12 to flee to Taiwan has highlighted the fears that many people feel in semi-autonomous Hong Kong about what they see as China's determination to end any push for greater democracy in the financial hub.
China's foreign ministry on Sunday labelled the group ""separatists"". Police in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, where they are being held, said they were suspected of illegal entry.
""Everyone, regardless of where they are in any jurisdiction, must respect local laws and be responsible for their actions,"" Hong Kong's Security Bureau, which is responsible for law and order in the semi-autonomous city, said in a statement.
Hong Kong people who broke laws overseas could expect ""feasible assistance"" from the city while respecting the local judicial system, it said.
The bureau said all 12 were suspected of committing crimes in Hong Kong, with 10 of them charged with offences such as manufacturing or possessing explosives, arson, rioting, assaulting police or possession of offensive weapons. Those 10 had been on bail and not allowed to leave Hong Kong, it said.
One was suspected of colluding with foreign forces under a national security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in June. The law allows for the punishment of anything China considers to be subversion, separatism, terrorism or such collusion.
Critics say the law undermines the special status the city was guaranteed when Britain handed it over to China under ""one country, two systems"" formula in 1997.
Supporters say it will restore stability after months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests.
Relatives of the detainees held a news conference in Hong on Saturday to demand their return.
The youngest of the 12 was a boy aged 16 and several of them needed medication, the relatives said.

The Security Bureau said families could get legal help and arrangements could be made for medication.

KABUL (Reuters) - Khan Agha has endured years of violence in Kunduz, but it was the Taliban's attack on the strategic city in northeastern Afghanistan, as the government and insurgents were preparing for historic peace talks, that unnerved him.
""Like me, the majority of Kunduz residents are living in fear,"" Agha, a 46-year-old driver, told Reuters. ""Looking at what's going on, anything could happen at any time.""
The Taliban offensive, encircling and almost seizing Kunduz late last month, came just weeks before the Kabul government sat down with their sworn enemies in Doha on Saturday to start historic talks aimed at ending 19 years of war that has killed and wounded more than 100,000 civilians.
The opening ceremony for the talks in the Qatari capital, replete with calls for peace from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a grand hotel and a host of dignitaries on video link urging a ceasefire, contrasted sharply with the recent violence on the ground in Kunduz.
Just hours after those talks started, Taliban and Afghan government forces clashed across Afghanistan, officials said, underscoring the uphill challenge of ending the long war. The most intense of those clashes on Saturday were in Kunduz, where Taliban again jostled with security forces for control of key highways, and the Afghan military deployed air and artillery strikes. 
Agha, stranded outside the city of 270,000 for four days during last month's larger attack and unable to reach his family on his way back from a delivery, has since stockpiled three months' worth of food in his small home.
A Reuters examination of the little-reported August offensive - the worst since 2015, when Kunduz briefly fell to the Taliban - shows how the insurgents have recently raised pressure on this strategic urban centre, a gateway in the north to mineral-rich provinces and to central Asia, and a hub for transportation and drug-smuggling.
The Taliban deny the Kunduz attack, saying their fighters only attacked bases in retaliation for troops firing on nearby areas.
""From the start of the year we never had plans of large attacks on any big city for one reason, and that is the peace process,"" said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. ""Attacking large cities can damage this process.""
Though it ultimately failed, the brazen attempt to take a strategic urban centre and the continuing pressure shows the Taliban are pursuing a fight-and-talk strategy, largely ignoring the international pleas to temper the violence and agree on a ceasefire.
""The scale of ambition to expand territorial control has not ebbed,"" said a senior Western diplomat. ""They want their fighters to stay active on the ground - it is a key concern ahead of talks as primary trust and confidence-building depends on a reduction in violence.""
The Taliban's muscular action comes just as the United States rapidly draws down its troops in Afghanistan, in line with President Donald Trump's promises to end America's longest war. A February pact between Washington and the Taliban set May 2021 as the date for the final pullout, subject to certain security guarantees. 
U.S. troop numbers are expected to fall to 4,500 by November from over 100,000 in 2011.

BATTLEGROUND TO NEGOTIATING TABLE
""A serious Taliban attack on Kunduz City breaks with the U.S.-Taliban agreement, at least in spirit, and sends an ominous signal ahead of intra-Afghan negotiations,"" said Elizabeth Threlkeld, deputy director of the South Asia program at the Washington-based Stimson Center.
The U.S. Embassy in Kabul did not comment.
The Taliban, after gradually tightening their grip on rural areas encircling Kunduz, conducted its offensive from Aug. 20 to 26, seizing several checkpoints and two bases on arterial roads into the city, spreading fear that the militants would seize control, three provincial council members said.
""They got enough close to the city that their small arms could easily reach the police headquarters and governor's compound,"" said council member Assadullah Saadat.
Fighting displaced more than 60,000 people, according the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Now that the government and Taliban are sitting down for peace talks, after months of delays, officials say a top priority is negotiating a comprehensive ceasefire, which the Afghan government has requested several times but the Taliban has rejected.
""Their military capacity represents a threat to the Afghan government, and they are likely to continue launching attacks over the coming months as negotiations kick off,"" Threlkeld said.
Afghan forces pushed Taliban fighters back with several airstrikes, said defence ministry spokesman Fawad Aman. On one of the heaviest days of fighting, 34 Taliban members were killed and 24 wounded, he said.
More than 100 Taliban members were killed 100 were wounded, said a local council member.
Though the immediate threat to the city was over, local security force members told Reuters the area remained under pressure.
Abdul, who asked that his full name not be used, said that in his seven years in the Afghan security forces in some of the toughest regions, he had not encountered the pressure he found in Kunduz where his unit was under constant fire and their vehicles could not be left in the open for even a few hours without attracting rockets.

""There is a common theory here: the more gain on the battleground, the bigger the share on the negotiating table,"" he said. ""I have experienced the worst time of my whole life here.""

ROME (Reuters) - After a six-month shutdown, the longest in Europe, Italy reopened most of its schools on Monday, testing the organisational skills of the government, the nerves of teachers and the self-control of excited students.
Schools in 13 of the country's 20 regions cautiously resumed face-to-face lessons, calling back 5.6 million students to their desks. The remaining seven regions have decided to delay for another week.
""There is a huge sense of excitement both on the part of us teachers and the children. We are very happy to see each other again, but it is also a struggle not to get too close,"" said Patrizia Zucchetta, a primary school teacher in Rome.
Battling to halt the spread of coronavirus, the government shut the nation's schools in early March. Efforts to make classrooms safe again and limit the possibility of fresh contagion have been mired in controversy.
""At the beginning there are going to be problems,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte acknowledged on Sunday.
Many of the new 2.4 million single desks needed to guarantee social distancing, have failed to arrive in time, unions say, while thousands of teaching positions remain vacant and older staffers have expressed concerns about the risks they face.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) says 59% of all Italy's primary and secondary school teachers are aged over 50 - the highest in the Western world - making the education system vulnerable to infections.
In Italy, about 35,500 people have died of COVID-19, the largest death toll in the European Union, and the number of new cases has picked up recently raising fears of a second wave. 
""We are following the security protocols, but there is fear and above all uncertainty about how the year will proceed. Many teachers are very anxious,"" said Alessandro Capata, deputy-head of Rome's Avogadro secondary school.
Parents also expressed doubts about the coming months. Schools say children with the slightest symptoms of a cold or fever must stay home. Pupils aged six and above have to wear masks outside their classrooms and should avoid physical contact.
""I have explained to the children to avoid contact, kisses and hugs, but I don't want them to live in terror because I don't think they need to,"" said Claudia Costantini, the mother of two primary school children.

""You have to make them understand things will get better.""

KIGALI (Reuters) - Paul Rusesabagina, portrayed as a hero in a Hollywood movie about Rwanda's 1994 genocide, appeared in a Rwandan court amid tight security on Monday, where prosecutors are expected to formally charge him and hear his plea. 
The Rwanda Investigation Bureau had previously said he would face several charges including ""terrorism, financing terrorism ... arson, kidnap and murder"".
Rwandan police have said that Rusesabagina - who called for armed resistance to the government in a YouTube video - was arrested on an international warrant. His family dispute that and say he was kidnapped from Dubai.
The former hotel manager was portrayed in the Oscar-nominated film 'Hotel Rwanda' using his job and his connections with the Hutu elite to protect Tutsis fleeing the slaughter. He later acquired Belgian citizenship and became resident in the United States. 

Rusesabagina has lived in exile since 1996, and is a strong critic of President Paul Kagame's government. Kagame enjoys widespread credit for returning Rwanda to stability after the genocide and boosting economic growth, but his rule has been tainted by accusations of widespread repression.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A Chinese scholar banned from Australia on security grounds says he has become critical of Canberra in recent years but is no security risk, adding his biggest contribution to a WeChat group at the centre of a security investigation was usually an emoji.
A decision by Australia's national security agency to cancel the visas of two Chinese academics of Australian literature has embroiled Canberra's oldest soft power programme in China in a bitter diplomatic dispute.
One of the banned academics, Chen Hong, had drawn recent attention for criticising the Australian government in the Chinese newspaper The Global Times. 
Chen told Reuters in an interview that he became critical of Australia after 2017, when Canberra began a ""heatbreaking"" noisy political debate about Chinese influence.
""I don't think Australia is a country that should be clamping down on voices,"" Chen said.
""In my classroom my students all know that I am an 'Australianist',"" he said. 
Chen teaches Australian culture at the East China Normal University in Shanghai, where he is director of the Australian Studies Centre.
Chen first visited Australia as a 24-year-old at the personal invitation of former Labor prime minister Gough Whitlam.
Whitlam established diplomatic relations between Australia and China in 1972, and later headed the government's Australia China Council, which helped fund the study of Australian literature in Chinese universities.
ASIO RAIDS
The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation moved in August to cancel Chen's visa, and that of Li Jianjun, director of the Australian Studies Centre at Beijing Foreign Studies University, labelling them a risk to national security, Chen confirmed.
ASIO has declined to comment on its reasons.
Chen said the men were members of a WeChat group with a New South Wales (NSW) state Labor politician and his staffer, whose homes were raided in June by federal police in a foreign interference investigation. 
China's foreign ministry said Chinese journalists in Australia were also searched by ASIO, but ASIO has declined to comment, and the government has said only that it takes foreign interference seriously and ASIO acts on evidence.
High Court documents lodged by the NSW politician's staffer, who is challenging the foreign interference law, show the investigation centres on a private social media group. 
Chen says the WeChat group included two Chinese journalists and was used to organise a dinner on one of his visits to Sydney.
Afterwards, people who attended the dinner continued to post photographs and newspaper articles. Chen says he was the least active member, and usually responded with an emoji or meme.
""I cannot establish any remote link between what I have been doing and the allegations that I constitute a risk to Australian security,"" he said.
Western Sydney University, where Li is studying for a PhD, told Chinese students in an email it was supporting Li to seek a review of the visa cancellation.
The university told Reuters in a statement Li had an ""impressive track record"". The visa decision was a matter for government, it said, adding it supported new government guidelines on foreign interference.
Jocelyn Chey, a former Consul-General in Hong Kong who also helped establish the Australia China Council in 1979, says she regards Li as ""one of our best friends in China"".
""Any time I have heard him speak about Australia it has been very positive,"" she told Reuters in an email.
POLITICAL RESEARCH
Two Australian academics who knew Chen said they were surprised by his recent criticism of the Australian government.
""From an Australian point of view, he seems to slip between academic work and journalism and the (China Communist) Party line,"" said Greg McCarthy, a former chair of Australian studies at Peking University.
McCarthy said he believes Chen felt betrayed as the diplomatic dispute between Canberra and Beijing worsened after 2017.
""Chen stepped into the middle of politics with a background in literature and an idealised version of Australia,"" he said.
Chen's engagement with Australia began in 1987 with a PhD on Australia's Nobel laureate Patrick White and he began studying in Australia in 1991. When he returned to Shanghai in 1994, he was asked by his university to interpret for another former prime minister, Bob Hawke, on a business trip.
Chen's university encouraged him to ""diversify"" from Australian literature, he said, so he ""expanded research to Australian politics and foreign affairs"".
He said the Global Times is the only English-language newspaper that offers opportunities in China to have his articles published, and his criticism of Australia is aimed at improving relations. He said he continues to write on Australian culture in Chinese literary journals.
Chen visited Australia six times in 2019, including one visit at the invitation of the Chinese embassy, which organised for three Chinese academics to meet with Australian think-tanks - including the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, labelled as ""anti-China"" by Beijing.

The Chinese embassy paid for his $1,000 airfare, he said. ""You can't buy someone for that,"" he added.

""One can only condemn the images that we are seeing,"" Darmanin told LCI television, when shown TV footage of hordes of Marseille supporters partying after the win in close proximity to one another, with many not wearing masks.
On Sunday night, Olympique Marseille earned a smash-and-grab 1-0 away win at Ligue 1 champions Paris St Germain, sparking the celebrations on Marseille's Vieux Port.
Last week, French Prime Minister Jean Castex singled out Marseille and Bordeaux as among the mainland French cities hardest hit by the resurgence of the COVID virus in France.

Democratic Taiwan has opened its doors to people from Hong Kong, which has been rocked by anti-government protests and where China has enforced a tough national security law. But Taiwan says anyone who enters must do so legally, even though its borders are largely closed due to coronavirus prevention steps. 
Five sources told Reuters the five people held in detention by Taiwan's coast guard had left by boat from Hong Kong and made it to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands at the northern end of the South China Sea. 
A Taiwan security source said they are currently at a Taiwan coast guard facility in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.
The Hong Kong Security Bureau said it had not received any information from Taiwan, nor from any family members asking for help. Police have made inquiries with the Taiwan authorities and are awaiting a reply, the bureau added.
""We call on Taiwan to take responsibility for combating cross-border crimes. If they are suspected of committing crimes in Hong Kong, they should not harbour criminals,"" Security Secretary John Lee said in a statement.
Taiwan's official Central News Agency reported late on Sunday the five ""have basic rights including access to lawyers"", citing a unnamed source. It did not elaborate and Reuters was not able to independently confirm the report.
Taiwan's government has declined to comment on the case and opposition parties have criticised the government for not doing more to help Hong Kongers fleeing political persecution.
Premier Su Tseng-chang, asked about the five, told reporters on Monday the government cared deeply about people from Hong Kong.
""As for the help to Hong Kong people, certain individual cases we cannot reveal,"" he said.
Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je's Taiwan People's Party said at the weekend the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party needed to provide a clear explanation for the case and amend existing laws so Hong Kongers fleeing political persecution do not have to resort to using people smugglers.
China's state-backed Global Times tabloid, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, wrote on Monday that the detention of the five showed the Taiwan government's pledges to help Hong Kongers was ""fake"". 
Last month China's coast guard detained 12 people from Hong Kong on a boat bound for Taiwan. China's foreign ministry says the 12 are separatists.
Hong Kong has become another source of tension between Taipei and Beijing, whose government claims Taiwan as sovereign Chinese territory. Taiwan has shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China.

LONDON (Reuters) - A collective failure by political leaders to heed warnings and prepare for an infectious disease pandemic has transformed ""a world at risk"" to a ""world in disorder"", according to a report on international epidemic preparedness.
""Financial and political investments in preparedness have been insufficient, and we are all paying the price,"" said the report by The Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB).
""It is not as if the world has lacked the opportunity to take these steps,"" it added. ""There have been numerous calls for action ... over the last decade, yet none has generated the changes needed.""
The GPMB, co-convened by the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO), is chaired by former WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland, who now also chairs an independent watchdog that monitors the WHO. 
The board's 2019 report, released a few months before the novel coronavirus emerged in China, said there was a real threat of ""a rapidly spreading pandemic due to a lethal respiratory pathogen"" and warned such an event could kill millions and wreak havoc on the global economy.
This year's report - entitled ""A World in Disorder"" - said world leaders had never before ""been so clearly forewarned of the dangers of a devastating pandemic"", and yet they had failed to take adequate action.
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed ""a collective failure to take pandemic prevention, preparedness and response seriously and prioritize it accordingly"", it said. 
""Pathogens thrive in disruption and disorder. COVID-19 has proven the point.""
The report noted that despite calling a year ago for heads of government to commit and invest in pandemic preparedness, for health systems to be strengthened and for financial risk planning to take seriously the threat of a devastating pandemic, little progress had been made on any of these.
A lack of leadership, it said, is exacerbating the current pandemic.
""Failure to learn the lessons of COVID-19 or to act on them with the necessary resources and commitment will mean that the next pandemic, which is sure to come, will be even more damaging,"" it said.

The worst economic slowdown amid major economies is also expected to drive debate, although the question hour -- in which lawmakers seek direct replies from ministers -- has been suspended in a move that’s only happened in times of war or national emergency, prompting criticism from the opposition.
Countries around the world have been grappling with how to conduct legislative business during the pandemic. In India this parliament session will be marked by several firsts. The Covid-19 epidemic has forced the overhaul of logistics and infrastructure to maintain social distancing among members.
Members are required to get tested for the virus no more than 72 hours before the start of the parliament session, according to a bulletin from the upper house or Rajya Sabha. Some senior lawmakers have informed the secretariat of both houses they will skip the session to avoid exposing themselves to possible infection. The average age of members of 545-seat lower house or Lok Sabha is 54 and that of the 250-member upper house is 63 years -- putting many in the high-risk group for serious complications from Covid-19.
Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation in the air conditioning system will be used, while polycarbonate sheets will separate galleries from chambers, additional display screens and special cables connecting the two houses have been installed.
Surging Epidemic
The session comes as Modi struggles to contain the spread of the virus, which is growing at one of the fastest paces in world and adding as many as 95,000 case each day. India is now the second worst affected country with more than 4.7 million infections and has the highest death toll after U.S. and Brazil.
India’s strict lockdown, implemented in late March to contain the outbreak, led to the biggest contraction among major economies with gross domestic product shrinking 23.9% in the three months to June from a year earlier, resulting in millions of job losses.
Modi’s administration is also working to de-escalate tensions along the disputed Himalayan border with China, where some 20 soldiers have been killed.
The main opposition Congress party intends to push the government over what it says are its failure to contain the coronavirus epidemic and manage relations with its nuclear-armed neighbor, China.
“We will demand white paper on China’s aggression along the Line of Actual Control, raise the issue of handing of Covid that is ravaging the country and highlight mismanagement of economy that lead to free fall of GDP,” said Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of Congress party in the lower house of parliament. “We will push the government to the corner.”
The session, that is scheduled to end on Oct. 1, will take up 11 bills to replace existing ordinances and some other legislation, including three bills on labor reforms, according to a government statement.

“It’s still too early,” Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 spokesman Antonio Dans said in a virtual briefing Monday, referring to the timing of the government’s decision to allow more passengers in public transport by gradually easing the 1-meter distancing rule. “Our coronavirus cases will most likely increase, and our recovery will slow,” he said.
The Department of Health said in a statement Sunday that people should still opt for transport with at least 1 meter of distancing, and “be extra vigilant” if they’re unable to. The Philippines has the highest number of coronavirus infections in Southeast Asia, with over 261,000 cases as of Sept. 13.

TALENT, Ore. (Reuters) - Search-and-rescue teams, with dogs in tow, were deployed across the blackened ruins of southern Oregon towns on Sunday as smoldering wildfires still ravaged U.S. Pacific Coast states after causing widespread destruction.
A blitz of wildfires across Oregon, California and Washington has destroyed thousands of homes and a half dozen small towns this summer, scorching more than 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares) and killing more than two dozen people since early August.
Tracy Koa, a high school teacher, returned to Talent, Oregon, on Saturday after evacuating with her partner, Dave Tanksle, and 13-year-old daughter to find her house and neighborhood reduced to heaps of ash and rubble.
""We knew that it was gone,"" Koa said in a telephone interview on Sunday. ""But then you pull up, and the devastation of just every home, you think of every family and every situation and every burnt-down car, and there are just no words for it.""
Crews in Jackson County, Oregon, where Talent is located, were hoping to venture into rural areas where the Almeda Fire has abated slightly with slowing winds, sending up thick plumes of smoke as the embers burned. From Medford through the neighboring communities of Phoenix and Talent, an apocalyptic scene of charred residential subdivisions and trailer parks stretched for miles along Highway 99. 
Community donation centers popped up around Jackson County over the weekend, including one in the parking lot of  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) in Phoenix, where farmers brought a pickup truck bed full of watermelons and people brought water and other supplies.
Farther north in Clackamas County, Dane Valentine, 28, showed a Reuters journalist the remains of his house. 
“This is my home,"" he said. ""Yep. All gone.”
Down the road, a woman with a Trump 2020 sign on her home, pointed a shotgun at the journalist and shouted at him to leave.
""You're the reason they're setting fires up here,"" she said, perhaps referring to false rumors that left-wing activists had sparked the wildfires. 
After four days of brutally hot, windy weather, the weekend brought calmer winds blowing inland from the Pacific Ocean, and cooler, moister conditions that helped crews make headway against blazes that had burned unchecked last week.
Still, emergency officials worried that the shifting weather might not be enough to quell the fires. 
""We're concerned that the incoming front is not going to provide a lot of rain here in the Medford region and it's going to bring increased winds,"" Bureau of Land Management spokesman Kyle Sullivan told Reuters in a telephone interview on Sunday.
At least 10 people have been killed in Oregon, according to the office of emergency management. Oregon Governor Kate Brown has said dozens of people remain missing across three counties. 
There were 34 active fires burning in Oregon as of Sunday morning, according to the state's office of emergency management website. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 'WAKE-UP CALL'
Thick smoke and ash from the fires have darkened skies over the Pacific Northwest since Labor Day last Monday, creating some of the world's worst air-quality levels and driving residents indoors. Satellite images showed the smoke was wafting inland in an easterly direction, the Bureau of Land Management said on Twitter on Sunday.
Drought conditions, extreme temperatures and high winds in Oregon created the ""perfect firestorm"" for the blazes to grow, Brown told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.
""This is a wake-up call for all of us that we've got to do everything in our power to tackle climate change,"" the Democratic governor said.
President Donald Trump, a Republican, was scheduled to travel to California and meet with federal and state officials on Monday. He has said that Western governors bear some of the blame for intense fire seasons in recent years, as opposed to warming temperatures, and has accused them of poor forest management.
In California, evacuations were ordered for the northern tip of the San Gabriel Valley suburb of Arcadia as the Bobcat Fire threatened communities.
At Wilderness Park in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, firefighters prepared to stave off the blaze as it worked its way downhill.
Steep terrain and dry hills that have not burned for 60 years are providing fuel for the blaze, which started over the Labor Day weekend.
As the smoke that has been clogging the air and blocking heat from the sun begins to lift, firefighters expect the weather to heat up and fire activity could increase, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.
All told in California, nearly 17,000 firefighters were battling 29 major wildfires on Sunday, Cal Fire said.
Improving weather conditions had helped them gain a measure of containment over blazes in many parts of the state, and some evacuated residents in Madera County near where the massive Creek Fire was burning, were allowed to go back home.

More than 4,000 homes and other structures have been incinerated in California alone over the past three weeks. About 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of land have been burned in the state, according to Cal Fire.

Suga, who has been the right-hand man to outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is likely to win at least 52 of the 141 votes allocated to regional party branches, and about 70% of the 394 votes allotted to party lawmakers, NHK said. That would give him more than 60% of the 535 votes up for grabs, handing him an outright majority in a race that includes former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba and former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida.
LDP lawmakers from both houses of parliament are set to vote from 2 p.m. at a Tokyo hotel. The LDP, which has been in government almost continuously since 1955, is expected to use its majority in parliament to elect Suga on Wednesday as the new prime minister to replace Abe, who is ending his record run as premier due to health reasons.
The Tough Job Facing Japan’s Next Prime Minister in Five Charts
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Taro Aso stoked speculation about an early election, saying it could happen “soon” to legitimize the new administration, Kyodo News reported. While Suga has repeatedly said the public doesn’t want an election during the pandemic, a surge in support for the cabinet gave rise to ideas that the new premier would call one soon.
Suga has pledged to continue the signature ultra-easy monetary policy of the current premier dubbed “Abenomics.” He added that more should be done on monetary policy, if needed, to protect jobs and companies during the current virus crisis.
Any sign of a departure from the path of Abenomics could send the yen surging and stocks sliding, triggering a re-evaluation of the outlook for the nation.

TALENT, Ore. (Reuters) - Tracy Koa, a high school teacher in Oregon, was in her classroom last Tuesday preparing for the first day of school - which would be online due to COVID-19 - when her 13-year-old daughter called in alarm: A fire was coming, and they had to evacuate, now. 
Koa raced home. From the driveway of her house in Talent, Oregon, she watched the cloud of smoke from the nearby wildfire turn to black from gray, a sign she knew meant homes were aflame. Within minutes, Koa, her partner David Tanksley and her daughter Seneca had packed their car with camping gear and their cat and joined a crawling line of traffic to evacuate.
They never saw their house standing again.
It was one of hundreds in Jackson County, Oregon, which has a population of about 220,000, that were reduced to rubble this week by the Almeda Fire. At least ten people have been killed in Oregon, and the death toll is expected to rise as conflagrations rage across the U.S. West. 
Koa and Tanksley returned to Talent on Saturday with dread. 
""We knew that it was gone,"" Koa said in a telephone interview on Sunday. ""But then you pull up, and the devastation of just every home - you think of every family and every situation and every burned-down car, and there are just no words for it.""
Thick smoke hung in the air over the blackened trees and the ground was littered with pieces of roof tiles and house foundations. In the pile of debris that was once their home, Tanksley dug out a small Buddha statue, surprisingly intact, that belonged to Koa's daughter since she was a baby. Koa clasped her hands in gratitude.
Some items had endured, although charred; the metal planter pot in the living room, the neighbors' red Adirondack chairs, a pile of blackened coins that had outlived a glass jar. Other precious possessions seemed to have evaporated, such as the crystal milk pitcher that belonged to Koa's grandparents, where she had placed roses just the other day, and the photos of her mother who died of bone cancer in June. 
For Koa's family, like many others, the year had already been hellish because of the COVID-19 pandemic before the inferno arrived. 
Koa and Tanksley had recently decided to relinquish the lease on their house in Talent because Tanksley, a consultant, lost work as the economy imploded and they could no longer afford it. They had been planning to move to a new mobile home in Medford Estates, a few miles north, this weekend.
""We were feeling like, we're finally going to be okay through all of this,"" Koa said.
But the fire destroyed their home in Medford Estates too. A lot of their soon-to-be neighbors in the mobile home park were elderly and did not have cars, which made Koa fearful that they had not gotten out.
""There was absolutely no warning at all,"" she said.
On Sunday Koa and Tanksley were planning to buy a trailer and then figure out a plan. Koa said she was eager to find ways to support her students, many of whom she expected had lost their homes and their school-issued laptops, thus complicating an already challenging start to the school year.
""We're going to be okay. We're together, we're happy, we have support from family and friends,"" Koa said. ""Now let's get ourselves situated so we can start helping other people.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus will seek the backing of Russia's Vladimir Putin at a crucial meeting on Monday after a fifth consecutive weekend of huge protests demanding that he step down.
Lukashenko, facing the gravest crisis of his 26 years in power, will travel to Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi with his fate in Putin's hands. 
Economic and military support from Moscow could help tip the balance in his favour as his security forces crack down hard on the opposition. 
The Belarusian opposition accuses Lukashenko of rigging last month's presidential election, which he says he won fairly with 80% of the vote. Since then, thousands of people have been arrested and nearly all the opposition's key leaders have been detained, deported or forced to flee the country.
At least 100,000 protesters took to the streets of the capital Minsk on Sunday, taunting Lukashenko with chants of ""You're a rat"". Police said they detained over 400 people.
Putin's actions so far suggest he has no desire to see the leader of a neighbouring ex-Soviet country toppled by pressure from the streets - even if Lukashenko has often proved a prickly and difficult ally.
The Kremlin leader said last month he had set up a ""reserve police force"" at Lukashenko's request, but it would be deployed only if needed. On Monday Russia will send paratroopers to Belarus for joint ""Slavic brotherhood"" military drills until Sept. 25, RIA news agency quoted the defence ministry as saying.
Russia has also offered to restructure Belarusian debt and support the banking system.
The cost of further Moscow backing could be Lukashenko's acceptance of even greater Russian dominance in the relationship between the two countries. 
The Kremlin has long pushed for closer political and economic integration with Minsk, including a joint currency, but Lukashenko has resisted the pressure from his more powerful neighbour. 
Yet the veteran Belarusian leader's position could become increasingly precarious should the protests persist, and grow.
Sunday's demonstration was one of the biggest yet.

""We have to show with this march that he doesn't control the country, that he is not in a position to speak on behalf of Belarusians,"" said Gennady, 35, a logistics worker who declined to give his last name.

Focused on three main themes: Helpers and Heroes, Your New Normal and Acts of Kindness, some of the photographs will also go on show in towns and cities across Britain later in the year.

Kate - wife of Prince William and a keen photographer herself - and other members of the panel assessed the images on the emotions and experiences they convey rather than on their photographic quality or technical expertise.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier this month that the United States would lift a 33-year arms embargo on Cyprus and deepen its security cooperation with Nicosia.
During a visit to Cyprus, Pompeo said on Saturday that Washington remained ""deeply concerned"" about Turkey's actions in the eastern Mediterranean, where it is at a standoff with Greece and Cyprus over maritime areas thought to be rich in natural gas. 
""The memorandum of understanding will not serve peace and stability in the eastern Mediterranean and will damage the solution of the Cyprus problem,"" Turkey's Foreign Ministry said.
It added that the recent steps by the United States increased the tensions in the eastern Mediterranean.
""We invite the U.S. to return to the neutrality policy it traditionally follows on the island of Cyprus and to contribute to the efforts aimed at the solution of the Cyprus issue,"" the ministry said.
The eastern Mediterranean island was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Its internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government represents the whole island in the European Union, although its authority is effectively confined to the southern part. North Cyprus is a Turkish Cypriot state recognised only by Ankara.
Turkey has sent two survey vessels to separate areas in the region, drawing strong protests from both Cyprus and Greece, which say Ankara is operating on their respective continental shelves.

Turkey says it has a legitimate claim over the area. There is no agreement between Greece and Turkey delimiting their continental shelves, while Turkey disputes any claims by Cyprus, with which it has no diplomatic relations.

""At the invitation of U.S. President Donald Trump, as the only European Union minister, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto will also attend ... the signing ceremony in the White House on Tuesday,"" Mate Paczolay told Hungarian news agency MTI.
Under the accord, which Trump helped broker, Israel agreed to suspend its planned annexation of areas of the occupied West Bank. The agreement also firms up opposition to regional power Iran, which the UAE, Israel and the United States view as the main threat in the conflict-riven Middle East.
Trump, who is heading into the homestretch of his presidential re-election campaign, announced the accord last month. On Friday, he said Bahrain would join the agreement. 
Major European powers like France and the UK welcomed the Israel-UAE deal, as did the European Union executive, which said it was good for regional stability.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose anti-immigrant rhetoric and erosion of democratic standards in the media, judiciary and academia have often sparked criticism in the EU, was an early and avid supporter of Trump.
""Since the White House prepared the agenda for stabilising the region, this has been the second development to prove that this is the best peace plan thus far and promises to bring peace in the Middle East at last,"" Szijjarto wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Saturday.
""The U.S. President thus deserves gratitude,"" he said, adding praise for Israeli, UAE and Bahraini leaders.

Szijjarto will also hold talks with Trump's son-in-law and chief adviser, Jared Kushner, the minister's spokesman said.

During the lockdown, which comes during the Jewish high-holiday season, Israelis will have to stay within 500 metres of their houses, but can travel to workplaces that will be allowed to operate on a limited basis.
Schools and shopping malls will be closed but supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open. The public sector will operate with fewer staff, but non-governmental offices and businesses will not have to close, as long as they do not accept customers.
Indoor gatherings are limited to 10 people and no more than 20 people outdoors.
""I know those measures will exact a heavy price on us all,"" Netanyahu said in a televised address. ""This is not the kind of holiday we are used to. And we certainly won't be able to celebrate with our extended families.""
The Finance Ministry said the lockdown will cost the economy, which slipped into a recession in the wake of the virus, an estimated 6.5 billion shekels ($1.88 billion).
Netanyahu, who has faced increasing criticism over his handling of the coronavirus crisis, said he instructed his finance minister to come up with a new economic package to assist businesses hurt by the lockdown.
Israel declared an even tighter lockdown in April when the virus first arrived, after which daily cases dropped to low double digits among a population of nine million.
But as the economy reopened, daily infections jumped, passing 4,000 last week. On Saturday, 2,715 new cases were reported. Since the outbreak began, 1,108 people have died.
The country's health system ""raised a red flag"" a few days ago, spurring the government to act, Netanyahu said.
The director general of the Health Ministry, Hezi Levy, said in a radio interview earlier on Sunday that ""dozens of localities are being sucked into the circle of morbidity.""
""We have to impose severe restrictions, but they will be able to stem this wave and not bring us to the brink of an abyss,"" Levy said.

Outlets close to the ruling Socialist Party identified the detainee as a former marine, John Heath Mattew, and said he was arrested on Thursday with three other people including a sergeant major in Venezuela's National Guard as they drove between Falcon and Zulia states in northwestern Venezuela. 
Ultimas Noticias newspaper, citing a preliminary report by the authorities, said the U.S. suspect was a former marine who had fought in Iraq, and that during the arrest soldiers seized a satellite phone, credit cards and mobile phones.
Reuters could not independently confirm the reports. 
Neither Venezuela's information ministry nor prosecutor's office immediately responded to requests for comment on Sunday.
The U.S. State Department had no comment on the matter. The White House did not respond to request for comment. 
Falcon state is home to the giant Paraguana Refining Complex, comprised of the Amuay and Cardon refineries. Both have experienced multiple outages in recent years that the opposition blames on mismanagement and lack of maintenance. 
Maduro has said the suspect was caught while spying on the refineries and had been in possession of ""specialized weapons ... large amounts of dollars and other items."" 
""All the evidence is there, the photographs, the videos, this spy is a marine, who was serving as a marine at CIA bases in Iraq,"" Maduro said on state TV on Friday.

Word of the alleged U.S. spy came after a Venezuelan court last month sentenced two former U.S. Green Berets to 20 years in prison for their role in a failed incursion in May.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - At least 100,000 Belarusian protesters took to the streets of Minsk on Sunday in one of the biggest demonstrations yet against President Alexander Lukashenko after he claimed a landslide victory in an election his opponents say was rigged. 
As public anger continued to build against Lukashenko, who has ruled the former Soviet nation for 26 years, Moscow offered him support by saying it would send paratroopers to Belarus for ""Slavic Brotherhood"" joint drills.
A wave of protests has swept Belarus since the Aug. 9 presidential election, which demonstrators say was actually won by Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Key opposition figures have since either been jailed or fled the country, with Tsikhanouskaya now in Lithuania. 
Lukashenko denies the election was rigged and has said foreign powers are behind the protests.
A vast column protesters marched through the capital Minsk towards a government district on Sunday, chanting ""Long live Belarus"" and ""You're a rat,"" a taunt that has frequently been used against Lukashenko during demonstrations. 
They came to a halt and chanted ""fascists"" as hundreds of riot police with shields blocked off the road. Meanwhile in the city of Brest, police used water cannons on protesters, according to the Nexta Live channel. 
Police said they had detained over 400 people in Minsk alone. A Reuters witness said that detentions were continuing on Sunday evening. 
The atmosphere was tense, with a large police presence in parts of the capital, and some central areas sealed off with barbed wire, including Oktyabrskaya Square and Independence Square - common focus points of anti-government rallies . 
The Interfax Russian news agency reported that shots had been fired into the air to warn off protesters in an area of Minsk where the Belarusian leadership lives. 
An interior ministry said later one shot was fired in the air. 
RUSSIAN PARATROOPERS
The unrest comes as Lukashenko, in power since 1994, prepares to travel to Russia on Monday for talks with President Vladimir Putin. 
Moscow, a neighbour and traditional ally, has stepped up support, offering to potentially restructure Belarusian debt, and providing banking liquidity. It has also said Russian riot police could be made available if needed.
On Sunday, Russia's defence ministry said it would send paratroopers from its elite Pskov division to Belarus for the joint drills starting on Monday and running till Sept. 25, the TASS state news agency reported. 
On the streets of Minsk, some critics of Lukashenko expressed hope that the sheer size of Sunday's protests would undermine the Belarusian leader and make it difficult for Putin to back him openly. 

""We have to show with this march that he (Lukashenko) doesn't control the country, that he is not in a position to speak on behalf of Belarusians,"" said Gennady, 35, a logistics worker who declined to give his surname.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - The mayor of Bogota on Sunday begged forgiveness and called for reconciliation after protests in Colombia's capital left 10 civilians dead and hundreds injured. 
Demonstrators in Bogota and satellite city Soacha this week protested the death on Wednesday of Javier Ordonez, 46. A widely shared video showed the father of two being repeatedly shocked with a stun gun by police. He died later in a hospital.
""We are here today to ask forgiveness of all victims of police brutality,"" Mayor Claudia Lopez said during a televised event to commemorate the victims of the protests. 
Seven young people, including teenagers, died after being shot in Bogota during protests on Wednesday. Another three people died in connection with the protests on Thursday night, including a woman who was hit by a stolen public bus.
Three people were also killed in Soacha during the protests.
""From our hearts we ask that justice be done, because we know of other such incidents that have gone unpunished and we don't want the same to happen with each one of these victims,"" said Bryan Baquero, whose sister Angie was killed in the protests.
Lopez reiterated her call for the police to be turned into a civilian rather than military organization. Colombia's police fall under the jurisdiction of the defense ministry. 
Police said Ordonez was found drinking alcohol in the street with friends in violation of coronavirus distancing rules. Two police officers implicated in Ordonez's death have been fired and face charges of abusing authority and homicide.
A further five officers connected to his death have been suspended.
Minister of Defense Carlos Holmes Trujillo begged forgiveness for police brutality on Friday, while President Ivan Duque said no abuse by security forces would be tolerated.
Hundreds of civilians were injured during the clashes between protesters and police, with dozens wounded by gunshots in Bogota. 

Close to 200 police officers were also injured, while at least 60 police stations were vandalized, as well as dozens of public transport vehicles.

LIMA (Reuters) - A bid by the opposition-led Congress to remove Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra appeared to falter on Sunday, after key political leaders rejected the ouster over fears the upheaval would plunge the country into a political crisis.
César Acuña, head of the second-largest party in Congress and a possible candidate in 2021 presidential elections, said an ouster would ""aggravate"" the country's current situation, already fragile from the impact of the coronavirus crisis.
Acuña's party had given key votes last Friday to start impeachment proceedings against Vizcarra over leaked audio tapes some lawmakers said showed the president trying to downplay ties to a singer being probed over government contracts.
Vizcarra, who accuses Congress of a plot, will face lawmakers on Friday when his removal would require 87 votes from the 130 legislators. The vote to launch the proceeding was approved by 65 votes last Friday, 21 of which came from Acuña's right-wing populist group Alianza para el Progreso.
Vizcarra, a centrist who assumed the presidency in 2018 after the resignation of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, has no representation in Congress and cannot run in next year's elections due to constitutional limits.
The Andean country, the world's No. 2 copper producer, has long be wracked by political turmoil, with most of its recent former presidents having been investigated over corruption. Vizcarra himself has pursued an aggressive anti-graft agenda.
""It would be absolutely unnecessary and impertinent to force a presidential vacancy by Congress,"" Acuña, a businessman who owns several private universities, posted on Twitter. ""It could only aggravate the ongoing political and health crisis.""
CAMPAIGN RIVALS
Others including Keiko Fujimori, leader of the third force in Congress and Julio Guzmán of the centrist Purple Party have distanced themselves from the impeachment bid and suggested that Vizcarra should instead be investigated when his term ends.
""Until today, there are not enough elements or the necessary procedures to vacate the president,"" Fujimori - who herself was investigated for receiving contributions from Brazil's Odebrecht in the previous election - said on Twitter on Sunday.
The government announced on Saturday that it would use all legal avenues to defend Vizcarra and that it will present a competition claim on the case to the Constitutional Court on Monday to stop the impeachment process.
Institutions such as the Ombudsman's Office have said there are a serious question marks over whether Congress is improperly using the presidential impeachment process.
On Saturday Prime Minister Walter Martos also accused the head of Congress, Manuel Merino, of trying to involve the Armed Forces in the impeachment process. Merino would replace Vizcarra if the president was ousted.
George Forsyth, a mayor and one of the early front-runners for the 2021 election, said he ""repudiated the unacceptable acts of the old political class"".
""The coup plotters cannot return, the Armed Forces defend the constitutional order, not personal or partisan interest,"" Forsyth, a former soccer goalkeeper, said on Twitter.
On Saturday, the presidents of Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia said in a statement that the events in Peru threatened the stability and governance of the country.

Peru's fragmented Congress was elected in January to complete the legislative period until July 2021, after Vizcarra dissolved the previous parliament last year amid a fight with the opposition over his anti-corruption reforms.

719,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2020 10:01AM ET</span>",Greek PM promises permanent migrant centre after fire on Lesbos,"LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - Greece will build a permanent migrant reception centre on Lesbos to replace the overcrowded refugee camp destroyed by a fire last week, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Sunday, calling for closer European involvement.
The fire at the Moria reception centre last week left more than 12,000 people without shelter, forcing most to sleep out in the open without proper sanitation or access to food and water, and pushed the migration issue back up the European agenda.
Mitsotakis said the construction of a new reception centre on the island to replace the notoriously squalid and overcrowded Moria facility would be the chance to reset the policy behind handling migrant arrivals.
""We want to turn this problem into an opportunity,"" he said. ""Europe should be a lot more involved in the management of the new centre wherever we finally decide it should be,"" he told a news conference.
He appeared to dismiss protests by Lesbos residents who have opposed the creation of a new centre as well as by migrants demanding to be resettled away from the island.
""I want to say with absolute certainty that there will be a permanent reception and identification centre - I want to send this message in all directions,"" he said.
Pope Francis, speaking to worshippers attending Sunday's prayer in St Peter's Square in Rome, mentioned the dire situation of the migrant camp on the Greek island.
""In recent days a series of fires have devastated the refugee camp of Moria, on the island of Lesbos, leaving thousands of people without a refuge, even if it was precarious,"" the pope said.
""I express solidarity and closeness to all the victims of these dramatic events,"" he said, adding refugees who seek asylum in Europe should be given a ""humane and dignified welcome"".
Greek authorities began admitting migrants to temporary tent accommodation outside the main port of Mytilene. In a concerning development, they identified what Mitsotakis said were ""dozens"" of cases of COVID-19.
Officials had been worried about the potential for an uncontrolled spread of the disease from the Moria camp which had been placed under quarantine before it burned down following the discovery of at least three dozen positive cases.
In the chaos following the fire on Wednesday, authorities lost sight of 35 people who had tested positive, deepening fears of an outbreak among migrants sleeping closely together without proper sanitation.
Earlier, Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said he expected around 1,000 people could be settled in the new tented shelter on Sunday and more would be able to come in over the coming days.

""We want to ensure that everybody has a tent, food and water,"" he told reporters.

LONDON (Reuters) - Former prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major said on Sunday Britain must drop a ""shocking"" plan to pass legislation that breaks its divorce treaty with the European Union, in a breach of international law.
The British government said explicitly last week that it plans to break international law by breaching parts of the Withdrawal Agreement treaty that it signed in January, when it formally left the EU.
""What is being proposed now is shocking,"" Major and Blair, who were adversaries in the 1990s as Conservative and Labour leaders, wrote in a joint letter published by the Sunday Times newspaper. 
""How can it be compatible with the codes of conduct that bind ministers, law officers and civil servants deliberately to break treaty obligations?""
Theresa May, the predecessor of current Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has also questioned whether international partners would be able to trust Britain in future.
Johnson's Internal Market Bill is aimed at ensuring Britain's four constituent nations can trade freely with one another after leaving the EU, but the government says that requires overriding part of the withdrawal treaty it signed with Brussels.
British ministers say the bill is a ""safety net"" in the event there is no trade deal reached with the bloc, but top EU officials say it undermines both the withdrawal treaty and trust in future talks. 
KEEPING THE PEACE
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Sunday that the Withdrawal Agreement on Northern Ireland ""is not a threat to the integrity of the UK"", and had been agreed by the two sides to protect peace on the island of Ireland.
""We could not have been clearer about the consequences of Brexit,"" Barnier said on Twitter.
His British counterpart David Frost responded by saying London had to reserve powers in the new bill in order to keep the peace in Ireland.
Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party, described the legislation as wrong on Sunday.
""We have broken the trust of our international partners,"" Starmer wrote in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper, adding that his party would oppose the bill in parliament unless changes were made.
European lawmakers have warned they would not approve any new trade deal unless the withdrawal agreement was fully implemented, while there is also talk of possible legal action.

""The reputation of the UK ... as a trusted negotiating partner on important issues like this is being damaged in a very serious way,"" Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney told the BBC on Sunday.

MOSCOW/TOMSK (Reuters) - Russians went to the polls on Sunday in local elections being scrutinised for signs of discontent with the ruling United Russia party following the suspected poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. 
Navalny, 44, had urged Russians to vote tactically against the ruling party in a bid to undermine its tight grip on power before he fell gravely ill in what Germany and his allies say was an attempt to kill him last month. 
United Russia, which backs President Vladimir Putin, dominates politics across 11 time zones, but the elections come at a time of public frustration over years of falling wages and the government's handling of the pandemic.
The regional polls, which will elect 18 governors and an array of local parliaments, city councils and municipal bodies, are seen as a dry run for next September's parliamentary elections.
Navalny's team has fielded dozens of candidates at elections for the city councils of Novosibirsk, Russia's third biggest city by population, and Tomsk, a student town of around half a million people. 
""People are tired of being promised a bright future if they just vote for them. Five years go by - and everything stays exactly the same,"" said Fateev, 32, one of two Navalny supporters competing in Tomsk.
One voter, a student from Tomsk who identified himself only as Alexander, said he had voted for Ksenia Fadeyeva, the second Navalny candidate there. 
""I think it's the same in all the regions. I doubt it's different anywhere. People want something new,"" he said. 
Navalny's allies have pressed ahead with the Kremlin critic's ""smart voting"" strategy, naming more than a thousand politicians on the ballots they think can beat ruling party candidates and telling their supporters to vote for them. 
The strategy aims to disrupt a political system that often bars the Kremlin's staunchest foes from running, while allowing softer candidates from the parliamentary parties to compete. Navalny has been unable to set up his own party. 
Early results coming in from Russia's Far East where polling stations had already closed several time zones from Moscow showed two Kremlin-backed regional governors winning election by a landslide in Kamchatka and the Jewish Autonomous Region. 
But there have been some signs of anti-Kremlin discontent in the regions.
Mass rallies in the far eastern city of Khabarovsk show no sign of abating two months after they flared over the arrest of a popular local governor who defeated United Russia's candidate in an election upset in 2018.

Early voting began on Friday after authorities stretched out the elections over three days, a move criticised by independent election watchdog Golos which warned the longer period would make it harder for monitors to catch fraud at polling stations.

The comment came a day after relatives of the detainees held a news conference in Hong Kong demanding the urgent return of the 12 who were intercepted by the Guangdong coast guard on Aug. 23 on a boat bound for Taiwan.
Donning masks and hats to shield their identities, they made their first public appeal for help and information on their relatives' plight, pleading for them to be allowed to consult lawyers appointed by their families and not the Chinese government and to be allowed to call relatives in Hong Kong.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus tweeted on Saturday that their arrest was ""another example of the deterioration of human rights in Hong Kong"", and called on mainland authorities to ""ensure due process"".
The arrests came about two months after the mainland government imposed a security law on the special administrative region following months of pro-democracy demonstrations.
China's Hua Chunying responded in another tweet.
""Seriously?! Fact check: The 12 people were arrested for illegally crossing the border in waters. They are not democratic activists, but elements attempting to separate #HongKong from China,"" she wrote.
The Shenzhen city police, in its first notice since the arrest, on Sunday said the 12 Hong Kong citizens were under criminal detention on suspicion of illegally crossing the border. The investigation is ongoing, it said.
""Police will protect the legitimate rights and interests of criminal suspects in accordance with law,"" the police said.
The relatives on Saturday said they had been given no information on the allegations, and that assistance from the Hong Kong government had been insufficient.
A spokesperson for the city's Immigration Department said staff were assisting in the case and were in regular contact with the families.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Tuesday said the city government would provide assistance to the arrested citizens.

Hong Kong has its own independent legal system and rule-of-law traditions that are vastly different from mainland China, where the justice system is ultimately controlled by the Communist Party.

KABUL (Reuters) - Taliban and Afghan government forces clashed across Afghanistan hours after the start of long-awaited peace talks in Doha on Saturday, officials said, underscoring the uphill challenge of settling a 19-year insurgency. 
Talks between the two sides were to begin shortly after a U.S.-Taliban agreement in February, but began only over the weekend after months of delays, caused in part by continuing Taliban offensives in the war-torn country.
""With the start of intra-Afghan talks we were expecting the Taliban to reduce the number of their attacks, but unfortunately their attacks are still going in high numbers,"" Fawad Aman, a spokesman for the Afghan defence ministry, said.
Representatives from a number of countries who spoke at the inauguration of the peace talks called on the Taliban to announce an immediate ceasefire before negotiators sat down to find a way to end decades of war in Afghanistan.
The Taliban did not say anything about a possible ceasefire at the ceremony.
Achieving a significant reduction in violence and how to get to a permanent ceasefire would be among the first issues the sides would discuss when they meet on Sunday, the head of Afghanistan's peace council, Abdullah Abdullah, told Reuters on Saturday.
No meeting between the two has been reported by either side in Doha on Sunday, but Qatar's state news agency reported teams led by Taliban's political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and Abdullah had met the Qatari Emir. 
Aman said that, on Friday, the eve of the inauguration of the talks, the Taliban had carried out 18 attacks against government forces and installations across the country, inflicting heavy casualties. 
""We don't have exact information about Taliban attacks on Saturday, but I can say the number of attacks has increased instead of decreased"".
Taliban attacks on Saturday night were confirmed by officials in the provinces of Kapsia and Kunduz.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement that the insurgent group attacked a convoy of Afghan forces that had arrived to launch an operation along a key highway in Kunduz. 

He added that security forces carried out air and artillery strikes on Saturday night in the provinces of Baghlan and Jowzjan.

SHEIKH ZAYED CITY, Gaza Strip (Reuters) - For two decades Palestinians have revered the founder of the United Arab Emirates for his generosity, especially those living on the Gaza housing estate that bears his name.
The $62 million development was gifted to the Palestinians a decade and a half ago by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who died in 2004, to provide homes for hundreds of families.
The estate changed the face of northern Gaza with its paved roads, 70 multi-floor residential buildings, gardens and a mosque, all adjoining Gaza's largest refugee camp, Jabalia.
But gratitude to the UAE's founding father has turned to anger at his son - Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, widely known as MbZ - after the Emirates' Aug. 13 announcement that it would become the first Gulf Arab state to sign a ""normalisation"" deal with Israel. Bahrain followed suit a month later.
Although a majority of Gaza's two million population need humanitarian assistance, Sheikh Zayed City resident Maher Hmaida, 57, said that providing aid to Palestinians did not give the UAE the right to make peace with the country he calls his ""enemy"" - Israel.
The anger across the estate is mirrored elsewhere in Hamas Islamist-run Gaza and in the West Bank, where Palestinians fear the UAE's move will weaken a long-standing pan-Arab call for Israeli withdrawal from occupied land and acceptance of Palestinian statehood in return for normal relations with Arab countries.
""How could his son do that? He should follow his father's example, not do the opposite,"" said Abdel-Rahman Tloly, 68, whose family was homeless for a year until they were housed in an apartment in Sheikh Zayed City in northern Gaza Strip.
""I don't like it, and no one does. We have fought for the sake of Jerusalem for 70 years, and he came and in seconds he wasted it."" 
Seeing the Israeli and UAE flags flying together ""burnt my heart,"" said Tloly, recalling how his home in Jabalia camp was bulldozed by Israel during the second Palestinian uprising that began in 2000 and ended some five years later.
Gaza, measuring just 360 square kilometres (139 square miles), has for years been blockaded by Israel and Egypt, who cite security concerns over its rulers, Hamas.
But despite the political and economic troubles faced by Palestinians in the narrow coastal strip, Tloly said he now wanted nothing more from the UAE, which is due to sign the normalisation deal with Israel at the White House on Tuesday.

""It would be like someone feeding you before he slaughters you,"" he said.

The protests late on Saturday also erupted in Al-Bayda, where the government was previously based, in Sabha in the south, and for the first time in Al-Marj, a stronghold of eastern based commander Khalifa Haftar, witnesses said.
Libya has been split into rival camps with parallel institutions in the east and west since 2014. Eastern Libya and much of the south is controlled by Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), which is aligned with a government and a rump parliament also based in the east.
A 14-month offensive by the LNA to take control of the capital, Tripoli, from the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) crumbled in June, weakening Haftar. 
Several hundred protesters turned out in the eastern towns to demonstrate against the political elite and over deteriorating living conditions that include lengthy power cuts and a severe banking crisis.
Similar protests broke out in late August in western Libya, where a new demonstration was planned for Sunday. Several dozen protesters had gathered outside the GNA building by midday.
In Benghazi the protesters, some armed with guns, set fire to the government building, leaving its white facade charred black, according to witnesses and pictures posted on social media. 
The building was constructed after the LNA took control of Benghazi in 2017 after a campaign that left parts of the port city in ruins. The fire was later brought under control.
The economic crisis across Libya and power cuts in the east have been worsened by a blockade of most of the country's oil facilities imposed by the LNA and its supporters since January.
The United States said on Saturday that Haftar had agreed to end the blockade, but sources in eastern Libya said negotiations were ongoing.

NATO members Turkey and Greece have overlapping claims to continental shelves and rights to potential energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean. Tensions flared last month after Ankara sent Oruc Reis to map out possible oil and gas drilling prospects in waters claimed by Greece, Cyprus and Turkey.
Turkey's navy had issued an advisory earlier this month saying that the Oruc Reis would continue operations in the area until Sept. 12.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had said the ship would continue exploratory operations for longer but no extension to the advisory was issued as of noon Sunday.
Refinitiv ship tracking data showed Oruc Reis, along with two accompanying vessels, had returned to a location just off the coast of Antalya on Sunday.
Turkey has repeatedly said it is open to solving issues with Greece through dialogue but had publicly rejected any pre-conditions, including Oruc Reis halting operations, ahead of negotiations.
""If there are those who set pre-conditions for Turkey, we have pre-conditions too and these pre-conditions need to be met,"" Cavusoglu said during a news conference on Saturday.
He did not elaborate and repeated that talks would ideally begin without pre-conditions.
Defence Minister Hulusi Akar, who was visiting Antalya's Kas district, near the Greek island of Kastellorizo, said on Sunday that Turkey was on the side of dialogue and a political solution.
""We have always done what is required by good neighbourly relations and we expect the same from the other side,"" he told reporters.
Turkey says it has a legitimate claim over the area in the eastern Mediterranean. There is no agreement between Greece and Turkey delimiting their continental shelves, while Turkey disputes any claims by Cyprus, with which it has no diplomatic relations.
Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Its internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government represents the whole island in the European Union, though its authority is effectively contained to the southern part. North Cyprus is an unrecognised Turkish Cypriot state recognised only by Ankara.
Seismic surveys are part of preparatory work for potential hydrocarbon exploration. Turkey has also been exploring for hydrocarbon resources in the Black Sea and discovered a 320 billion cubic metre (11.3 trillion cubic feet) gas field.

LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - Crisis-weary residents of the Greek island of Lesbos and the thousands of migrants stranded there after this week's refugee centre fire are united by one thing - they all want to see the migrants moved off the island.
Lesbos and other islands off the Turkish coast have been among the main entry points for migrants into Europe for years, peaking in 2015-16 when around a million people arrived in a seemingly endless stream of small boats.
""One island cannot carry all of this burden,"" Dimitris Koursoubas, a senior official responsible for migration in Lesbos and the other northern Aegean islands told Reuters.
With 4,280 new arrivals in Lesbos so far this year, numbers have been lower than in previous years. But incidents of theft and damage blamed by residents on migrants, many of whom have only what they carry, and a feeling of being abandoned by both the government in Athens and Greece's European partners over more than a decade have worn Lesbos down. 
""People from Lesbos, Chios, Samos are hospitable,"" he said. ""There will always be extreme voices, but in general they are welcoming. But they are fed up.""
The islands' tourism industry, which had shown signs of recovery after the 2015 migrant crisis, has been left reeling by COVID and there is little sign of holidaymakers, with tourist numbers down 90%, according to local officials.
The overflowing camp held more than 12,000 migrants - four times the numbers it was supposed to - forcing thousands to live in squalor and putting a strain on both its occupants and residents in nearby areas who have mounted a series of protests this year demanding the centre be shut down.
But with the European Union unable to reach agreement between countries like Greece and Italy, which want the bloc to share the burden and others refusing to take in refugees, for the moment Lesbos' 86,000 islanders and migrants remain unwillingly together.
Greece's conservative government says it is determined to contain the problem and has removed some 13,500 people from Lesbos camps this year, according to migration ministry data.
But authorities have refused to allow any mass transfers to the mainland since the fire broke out. They face anger both from islanders and from migrants themselves who have squared off against police setting up new temporary shelters outside the main port of Mytilene.
""No one wants to go to the new camp, we all want to go to another country. Nobody wants to stay here, we are in a prison,"" said 23 year-old Sajida Nazari, a student from Afghanistan who has been on Lesbos for a year.
While the Greek islands have always prided themselves on a welcoming culture, a decade of crisis has poisoned the atmosphere and Nazari said migrants faced a threatening climate whenever they venture outside.
""Local people are hostile, they attacking us verbally and some times physically, especially when we go to Mytilene to shop,"" she said.
This week's crisis is not the first on Lesbos and with tensions between Greece and Turkey rising and a strong anti-immigrant mood evident in many European countries, it is unlikely to be the last.

But Koursoubas said the situation on the island could not continue. ""Europe will also need to take in some of these people who did not cross over to stay in Mytilene, in Greece but to go to Europe.""

728,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Thailand tells universities to stop students' calls for monarchy reform,"By Panu Wongcha-um and Panarat Thepgumpanat
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai authorities have summoned the heads of universities to tell them to stop students demanding reform of the monarchy, warning that such calls could lead to violence, a member of the military-appointed Senate said on Sunday.
Thailand has faced near daily protests since mid-July calling for the departure of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and for a new constitution and elections.
Some groups have also listed 10 demands to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's Royal Palace, breaking a long-standing taboo in the Southeast Asian country.
Senator Somchai Sawangkarn told Reuters that letters had been sent by state-appointed provincial governors to university heads, summoning them to meetings ahead of protests planned on Sept. 19 in Bangkok and elsewhere.
""University administrators should create understanding with the students on this and should put a stop to the demands on the monarchy,"" he said.
""We did not tell the governors to block the protests but we want them to create understanding with university officials, especially on the 10 demands for the monarchy.""
An interior ministry official confirmed that such letters had been sent and said it was standard procedure. The Palace did not respond to requests for comment.
Student leader Panusaya ""Rung"" Sithijirawattanakul, 21, who was the first to read out the list of 10 demands for palace reform, told Reuters it amounted to ""desperate tactics"".
""They are using this tactic to try to suppress and threaten people,"" said Panusaya, one of more than a dozen activists arrested over previous protests before being released on bail.
A letter to one university reviewed by Reuters said: ""There are concerns about the behavior of some groups taking part in the protest that are inappropriate, for example those that want to topple the monarchy and those that demand voiding Article 112 of the criminal code.""
Article 112 refers to Thailand's lese majeste laws, which sets a jail term of up to 15 years for insulting the king.
""COULD LEAD TO VIOLENCE""
""This is a sensitive matter that could lead to violence,"" the letter says - referring specifically to incidents in 1976 and 1992, when security forces killed scores of anti-government protesters.
It said police would take legal action against anyone behaving inappropriately at protests while the digital ministry would take legal action against anyone using social media ""to distort and defame the monarchy"" or to incite protests.
A participant at one meeting said authorities asked his university to draw up a list of potential troublemakers.
Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said he was not aware of the letters from the interior ministry. He said the government would not try to stop the protests, but authorities would enforce the law and did not want ""escalation or clashes"".
Most Thai universities are sponsored by the state.
Anusorn Unno, a lecturer at Thammasat University, who joined over 100 academics in a statement supporting students' freedom of expression in August, said such orders were not unusual.
""The only difference this time is that some evidence has leaked,"" he said.
Prime Minister Prayuth, a former junta leader who rejects accusations that last year's elections were unfair, has said protests should be allowed but not criticism of the monarchy.
The Senate helped in assuring Prayuth's position as prime minister after the 2019 election. It was appointed by Prayuth's previous military government and protesters want it scrapped under a new constitution.

Among the 10 reforms sought to the monarchy by some student groups are a reduction in the king's constitutional powers as well as his personal control of the royal fortune and some units of the army.

Hamza Abdulrahman Jelwal, 35, a supervising nurse at a quarantine centre in the coastal city of Misrata, has not seen his family since Libya's lockdown began in March. He has also not been paid.
He tested positive for the coronavirus in August and was quarantined in the same facility. As soon as he got better, he got up and went back to work. 
""We work 12 hours a day. It is exhausting for medical staff because there is no rest,"" he said. 
His experience underscores the high stakes and growing challenges for Libyan medics as the number of confirmed cases spikes. Figures have climbed rapidly from a few hundred last month to almost 20,000 now. 
The United Nations' acting Libya envoy, Stephanie Williams (NYSE:WMB), has told the Security Council that the real number of cases in Libya is almost certainly far higher and that the health system is ""unable to respond"". 
Libya has been divided since 2014 between the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli and the west, and areas of the east and south held by Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). 
The two rival administrations operate parallel governments that have issued differing public health orders aimed at controlling the spread of the virus, but both closed their foreign borders early in the crisis. 
SHORTFALLS AND DELAYS
Despite that measure, an outbreak began in July in the southern desert city of Sebha, attributed by some local people to the return of Libyans flown home after being stranded abroad. 
The virus then spread into the main urban centres in the coastal cities of Tripoli and Misrata on the GNA side and Benghazi, controlled by Haftar. 
The quarantine centre where Jelwal works, in the Gharara district, had been a private clinic but was taken over for the crisis by the state-operated Misrata Medical Centre. 
Administrative issues closed it for most of a month early this summer, he said, contributing to the accelerating number of cases as people could not come in to quarantine.
That was when staff started to quit because they had not been paid, he said. There are few ventilators and little other equipment. State funding, regularly hit by shortfalls and delays, has been particularly disrupted this year because of a blockade on oil exports by the LNA and its allies. 
Jelwal was not the only member of staff to fall ill as they tried to cope with the onslaught of new cases. 
A colleague, Aisha Milad Belhassna, another nurse at the centre also caught the disease. 
""Suddenly the air starts to decrease until you reach the point where you feel like you are losing your life,"" she said.

Speaker Nabih Berri leads the Amal Movement, a Shi'ite Muslim party allied to the powerful Hezbollah group.
Lebanon's leadership promised Macron in Beirut on Sept. 1 that they would form a government of technocrats without party loyalties in about two weeks. They have just days left.
A senior political source said it would take a ""miracle"" to meet the deadline. Forming a cabinet usually takes months.
Kassem Hachem, a senior figure in Berri's parliamentary bloc, said Macron, who has led international efforts to help fix Lebanon's crippling economic problems made worse by a huge blast in Beirut last month, spoke to Berri on Saturday.
Hachem said Berri insisted that the finance ministry, at the centre of the impasse, should stay in the hands of the Shi'ite community, which has typically held the post under Lebanon's sectarian power sharing arrangements.
The cabinet is being formed by Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adeeb, a Sunni who quit as ambassador to Berlin to take the post. He has made few public comments, but sources have said he wants to shake up the leadership of ministries, some of which have been controlled by the same sectarian factions for years.
France has drawn up a roadmap of measures to tackle endemic state corruption and deal with a host of other economic problems so Lebanon, facing its worst crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war, can secure desperately needed international aid.
Donors pledged billions of dollars in 2018 but funds were not disbursed because Lebanon failed to deliver reforms.
The finance minister will be central to building the reform programme needed to end a banking crisis that sent the currency into tailspin, plunging many Lebanese into poverty.

After three days of negotiations with political leaders and civil society groups, the junta's roadmap was meant to chart an agreed transition for Mali after the Aug. 18 coup that toppled President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.
M5-RFP said the final version of the charter did not reflect the results of talks, which it said included a majority vote for a civilian interim president.
""M5-RFP distances itself from the resulting document which does not reflect the views and decisions of the Malian people,"" it said in a statement released late on Saturday.

It was the fifth day in a row with new infections above 1,000 for the country of 10.7 million after cases began to accelerate in August. 
Adjusted for population, the country has reported 94 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the last 14 days, according to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control data. Only Spain and France have seen a bigger spike in that time.
Graphic: Czech spike in COVID-19 cases among fastest in Europe Czech spike in COVID-19 cases among fastest in Europe https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/CZECH/xklvynyjnpg/chart.png
The Czech Republic came through an initial outbreak of the coronavirus that began in March relatively well compared to western European neighbours and has kept the death toll lower than most peers. 
As of Saturday, 453 patients had died out of a total 35,401 cases, with 60% of patients having recovered. 
The country was one of the first in Europe to mandate wearing masks, shut schools and retail businesses, and restricted travel to contain the spread of the virus. 
But it was also quick to ease measures going into the summer months and aims to avoid repeating the harsh lockdowns that helped lead to a record 11% year-on-year contraction in the economy in the second quarter. Last week, it tightened rules for face mask use across the country to fight the rise in cases. 
The Czech Republic did not report its 10,000th case until mid-June and its 20,000th case until mid-August before quickly surpassing 30,000 cases this past week.
The uptick in recent infections led neighbouring Germany to announce on Wednesday that it would require travellers from the Czech capital Prague to provide a negative COVID-19 test or observe a two-week quarantine period upon entry.
Amid the spike, the Czech government has said hospitalisations remain below peaks of over 400 seen in the first few months of the outbreak, although figures are growing quickly, with 297 patients hospitalised as of Friday, up from 172 at the start of September.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea on Sunday eased its tough social distancing policy for the next two weeks in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, with new daily novel coronavirus cases hovering stubbornly within triple digits.
The government has lifted a ban on onsite dining after 9 p.m. though still requires restaurants and cafes to restrict seating and record patrons' names and contact details.
While leisure facilities such as gyms and internet cafes are also allowed to reopen, under so-called phase two restrictions, indoor gatherings are limited to 50 people and outdoor gatherings to 100, while spectators are banned from sporting events.
Health authorities said the easing would contribute toward a reopening of the economy, before returning to tougher guidelines for two weeks again from Sept. 28 during the Chuseok holiday.
""After a comprehensive review of the recent situation and expert opinion, the government intends to adjust social distancing to phase two in the Seoul area for two weeks,"" Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a televised meeting of government officials.
Infection numbers fell steadily to the low 100s after the government imposed unprecedented social distancing curbs in late August, but surged last week as small clusters emerged.
""The number of daily infections is still not dropping to double-digits and it isn't yet a situation where measures can be significantly relaxed, as one out of four people's path of transmission is untraceable,"" Chung said.

The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 121 new cases of novel coronavirus infection as of midnight on Saturday, bringing total infections to 22,176, with 358 deaths.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton on Sunday defended the government's right to intelligence raids to prevent foreign interference, after China condemned searches on the homes of its journalists working in Australia.
Dutton declined to directly confirm that the Chinese journalists were questioned by Australia's intelligence agency in June, saying an investigation was still underway, but said 
there was some ""activity"" by the country's intelligence agency.
""Where (the Australian Security Intelligence Organization) has sufficient grounds for the execution of a search warrant, or for activities otherwise, then they'll undertake that activity,"" Dutton said on the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) television.
""If people are masquerading as journalists or business leaders or whoever they might be, and there's evidence that they are acting in a contrary nature to Australian law, then .... (the) agencies will act.""
The raids were revealed by China's foreign ministry last week in the wake of two Australian journalists departing China after questioning by Chinese police. Australia's trade minister said on Friday the agencies acted on evidence related to a foreign interference investigation.
On Saturday, China's state media condemned the raids.
Relations between Australia and its top trading partner China have been deteriorating gradually over the recent years and have soured further this year after Canberra called for an investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus, angering Beijing.

Pemberton was accompanied by representatives from the U.S. embassy on his way to the airport, she told state television PTV-4.
""As a consequence of the deportation order against him, Pemberton has been placed on the Bureau's blacklist, perpetually banning him from coming back,"" BI Commissioner Jaime Morente said in a statement.
Details of Pemberton's flight arrangements were not disclosed to the media until after he left amid tight security measures.

Duterte's move to pardon Pemberton has sparked condemnation from activists who described the move as a ""mockery of justice"".

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russians vote on Sunday in dozens of local elections that will be scrutinised for signs of discontent with the ruling United Russia party following the suspected poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
Navalny, 44, had hoped to undermine United Russia's grip on regional power and had urged his supporters to vote against it tactically before he fell gravely ill in what Germany and his allies say was an attempt to kill him last month. 
United Russia, which backs President Vladimir Putin, dominates regional politics, but the elections come at a time of public frustration over years of falling wages and the government's handling of the pandemic.
Seen as a dry run for next September's parliament elections, the regional polls will elect 18 governors and an array of local parliaments and city councils.
Early voting began on Friday after authorities stretched out the elections over three days, a move criticised by independent election watchdog Golos which warned the longer period would make it harder for monitors to catch fraud at polling stations.
Navalny's allies have pressed ahead with the Kremlin critic's ""smart voting"" strategy, naming more than a thousand politicians on the ballots they think can beat ruling party candidates and telling their supporters to vote for them. 
The strategy aims to disrupt a political system that often bars the Kremlin's staunchest foes from running, while allowing softer candidates from the parliamentary parties to compete. Navalny has been unable to set up his own party. 
The anti-corruption campaigner also has dozens of allies running in elections for seats in the city councils of Novosibirsk and Tomsk in Siberia. 
There have been some signs of anti-Kremlin discontent in the regions.

Mass rallies in the far eastern city of Khabarovsk show no sign of abating two months after they flared over the arrest of a popular local governor who defeated United Russia's candidate in an election upset in 2018.

The numbers confirm a steady downward trend from a peak of more than 700 cases in a single day in early August. Victoria accounts for about 75% of Australia's more than 26,600 COVID-19 cases and its capital, Melbourne, has been under strict lockdown for several weeks.
The city will remain under hard lockdown, but the amount of time people will be able to spend outside will double to two hours per day and the overnight curfew will be shortened by an hour as of Monday.

The 25 people still at sea disembarked late on Saturday in the port town of Pozzallo, in Sicily, in southern Italy, due to health reasons, ending a ""nightmare"", the statement said.
""The longest and most shameful stand-off of European maritime history ends,"" Mediterranea tweeted after the landing. 
The migrants had been transferred on Friday to the Italian charity ship Mare Jonio, operated by Mediterranea, after being anchored off the coast of Malta on the Maersk Etienne - operated by Maersk Tankers - since August. 
The people aboard were ""in serious psycho-physical conditions that make it impossible for them to stay on the petrol tanker"", Mediterranea said after the transfer. 
The Maersk Etienne's crew had rescued the migrants, including a pregnant woman, on Aug. 4 near Malta from a wooden dinghy that had been at sea for days and sank immediately after the rescue operation.
Neither the Maltese, Italian nor Libyan authorities had let the migrants come ashore, according to Maersk Tankers, the operator of Maersk Etienne.
""This 40-day blockage is intolerable,"" French NGO SOS Mediterranee said on Twitter, calling on countries of the European Union to provide a solution for almost 300 migrants aboard a ship operated by Spanish group Open Arms. 
For years Italy has been the primary route into Europe for hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and other migrants, while Libya's west coast has been a main departure point for African migrants hoping to reach Europe.
Numbers started falling due to an Italian-led effort to disrupt smuggling networks and support the Libyan coast guard to intercept boats, but have picked up in 2020.

LIMA (Reuters) - Allies of Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra pledged on Saturday to fight an attempt by Congress to impeach him and accused a congressional official of trying to involve the military in the effort as political tensions spiked in the Andean nation.
Congress voted on Friday to pursue impeachment proceedings against Vizcarra, plunging the Andean country into political crisis even as the major copper producer battles an economic slump and coronavirus outbreak with one of the highest mortality rates in the world.
Prime Minister Walter Martos, flanked by senior commanders from the country's Army, Navy and Air Force, said the government would use all legal means, including a lawsuit in the Constitutional Court to stop the impeachment process.
The leader of Congress, Manuel Merino, acknowledged at a news conference he had contacted military commanders but denied that he was seeking any sort of military support for impeachment, as Defense Minister Jorge Luis Chavez accused. 
""The attitude of the Congress leader has been reckless in attempting to involve the armed forces in a political process,"" said Chávez, a retired general, adding the general commanders all remained ""absolutely on the sidelines"".
Minister of Justice Ana Neyra said that the bid to oust Vizcarra was affecting the ability of the executive branch to operate properly and ""undermining the constitutional order.""
POLICE RAIDS
The prosecutor's office separately said on Saturday police raided eight homes of former government employees and associates in connection with allegations of hiring abuses at the heart of the impeachment case against Vizcarra. 
The prosecutor said the raids included the home of Richard Cisneros, a little-known singer who goes by the name Richard Swing, as well as two officials close to Vizcarra.
Cisneros was awarded government contracts worth around $49,500 for motivational talks, which some lawmakers allege resulted from Vizcarra's influence. 
Peru's Congress has summoned Vizcarra to make his defense on Friday. The president, who has no party representation in the legislature but remains popular with voters, has rejected the accusations and accuses parliament of plotting against him.
The abrupt move to oust Vizcarra would need the support of 87 votes from the 130 legislators. The motion to start the impeachment process, citing ""moral incapacity,"" passed with 65 votes in favor and 36 against.
Vizcarra assumed the presidency in March 2018 after the resignation of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski amid allegations in Congress of irregularities.
In September 2019, Vizcarra dissolved Congress over a dispute with the opposition on anti-corruption reforms, and in January a fragmented parliament was elected to complete the legislative term until July 2021.
If Vizcarra is removed from office, Merino would assume the presidency under Peru's constitution. The vice presidency is currently vacant after a resignation.

Vizcarra had already called presidential and legislative elections for April 10 and has said that he will not run.

747,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>",Pompeo says U.S. 'deeply concerned' over Turkey actions in east Med,"NICOSIA (Reuters) - The United States remains ""deeply concerned"" about Turkey's actions in the eastern Mediterranean, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Saturday, urging a diplomatic end to a simmering crisis over offshore natural resources.
Tensions in the eastern Mediterranean have risen over claims and counter claims pitting Turkey against Greece and Cyprus to maritime areas thought to be rich in natural gas. 
""Countries in the region need to resolve disagreements including on security and energy resource and maritime issues diplomatically and peacefully,"" Pompeo said in a fleeting trip to Cyprus on Saturday night, where he met with President Nicos Anastasiades.
""Increased military tensions help no one but adversaries who would like to see division in transatlantic unity,"" he said.
Turkey has sent two survey vessels to separate areas in the region, drawing strong protests from both Cyprus and Greece, which say Ankara is operating on their respective continental shelves.
Turkey says it has a legitimate claim over the area. There is no agreement between Greece and Turkey delimiting their continental shelves, while Turkey disputes any claims by Cyprus, with which it has no diplomatic relations.
""We remain deeply concerned by Turkey's ongoing operations ... the Republic of Cyprus has the right to exploit its natural resources including the right to hydrocarbons found ... in its exclusive economic zone,"" Pompeo said.
The east Mediterranean island was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Its internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government represents the whole island in the European Union, though its authority is effectively contained to the southern part. North Cyprus is an unrecognised Turkish Cypriot state recognised only by Ankara.
Earlier this month the United States said it would lift a 33-year embargo on ""non lethal defence articles"" applied on Cyprus in 1987 and deepen its security cooperation with Nicosia, prompting an angry response from Turkey.
Pompeo said he also raised with Anastasiades concerns over Russian money laundering -- something Cyprus repeatedly denies -- as well as frequent port calls by the Russian navy to the island. 

""We know that all the Russian military vessels that stop in Cypriot ports are not conducting humanitarian missions in Syria and we ask Cyprus and the president to consider our concerns,"" Pompeo said.

Maria Kolesnikova, 38, has emerged as a key opposition figure after others were either jailed or forced out of the country, including Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya who challenged President Alexander Lukashenko in the presidential election. 
Protesters say the Aug. 9 election was rigged to hand Lukashenko a phoney landslide win and that Tsikhanouskaya - who has since fled to Lithuania - was the real winner. Lukashenko, who has been in power for 26 years, denies this and has said foreign powers are behind the protests. 
At least 5,000 protesters, many of them women, gathered in central Minsk on Saturday, chanting ""Go away!"" in reference to Lukashenko, and ""Masha"" - a common alternative for Maria - in support of Kolesnikova, a Reuters witness said. 
""Sveta is my president, Masha is my queen,"" read one of the slogans held up in the crowd. 
Police started detaining people shortly after the protests started at 1200 GMT. As of 1650 GMT, at least 46 were held in police stations, mostly women, according to the Spring human rights group. 
Kolesnikova was driven to the Ukrainian border earlier this week after being seen snatched off the streets of Minsk and into a van by masked men. 
According to two allies who were with her, she prevented an attempt to expel her from Belarus by tearing her passport up into small pieces and throwing it out of a car window. She is now detained in Minsk, and faces a potential long prison term over accusations of trying to seize power illegally. 
Tsikhanouskaya, who stood against Lukashenko in place of her better-known husband who was detained before election, called on Saturday for the police to stop cracking down on dissent. 
""Violence you are putting on women is disgraceful,"" she said in a statement. ""Anyone who commits a crime against peaceful protesters will be called to answer."" 
On Saturday, Lukashenko met his law enforcement officials, asking for an update with ""political situation"" in Belarus, Belta newsagency reported, without providing other details. 

He is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi to discuss ""energy cooperation and two countries' strategic partnership"", the Kremlin has said.

PARIS (Reuters) - French police fired tear gas and arrested more than 250 people in Paris on Saturday as they tussled with ""yellow vest"" protesters seeking to revive an anti-government movement curbed by a coronavirus lockdown this year.
The ""yellow vests"", named after motorists' high-visibility jackets, emerged in late 2018 in protest against fuel taxes and the cost of living, posing a major challenge to President Emmanuel Macron as demonstrations spread across France.
By midday on Saturday, hundreds of demonstrators had gathered at the starting points of two authorised marches in Paris. 
While one cortege proceeded without incident, the other march was aborted as police clashed with groups who left the designated route and set fire to waste bins and a car.
Some protesters wore black clothes and carried the flag of an anti-fascist movement, suggesting the presence of radical demonstrators dubbed ""black blocks"" often blamed for violence at street marches in France.
The police repeatedly used tear gas to counter small groups of roaming protesters, before they dispersed towards the end of the afternoon.
Police had made 256 arrests by 6 p.m. (1600 GMT), with many for carrying items like tools that could be used as weapons.
A heavy police presence notably worked to prevent protesters reaching the Champs-Elysees. The famous shopping avenue was the scene of rioting at the height of the 'yellow vest' movement, and many stores there were boarded up on Saturday.
The return of the protests comes as France grapples with a resurgence in coronavirus cases that set a daily high on Thursday at nearly 10,000. 

Police had called on Saturday's demonstrators to respect coronavirus measures in Paris, which is among France's high-risk ""red zones"" and where it is compulsory to wear a face mask in the street.

LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - Angry migrants left homeless by a blaze at Europe's largest refugee centre demanded to leave the Greek island of Lesbos on Saturday as authorities opened up new tent shelters and European leaders faced growing calls to take in more of the displaced.
More than 12,000 people, most from Africa and Afghanistan, have been sleeping rough since flames swept through the notoriously squalid and overcrowded Moria camp earlier this week. Some residents had COVID-19, raising fears the outbreak could spread.
Under a hot sun on Saturday, hundreds of migrants, many chanting ""Freedom"" and ""No Camp"", gathered as bulldozers cleared ground in preparation for tents to be put up.
Some carried handwritten signs carrying messages including ""We don't want to go to a hell like Moria again"" and ""Can you hear us Mrs Merkel?"" in an appeal to the German chancellor.
""The fire made things much more difficult,"" said Sajida Nazari, a 23-year-old student from Afghanistan who has been on Lesbos for over a year. ""We don't have food, we don't have water, we don't have freedom.""
Police briefly fired rounds of teargas when some of the protesters attempted to march down a road leading to the island's main port of Mytilene, which police had blocked while work on the new tent settlement continued nearby.
The fire at the camp, which was holding four times the number of people it was supposed to, has returned the spotlight to the migration crisis facing the European Union, which has struggled to find a response that goes beyond temporary fixes.
German Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz called on Europe to accept more refugees but the difficulty of reaching an accord was underlined by Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who ruled out taking more in. 
Greek authorities have refused any mass transfer off the island, located a few miles off the Turkish coast, despite growing hostility from local residents angry after years at the front line of the crisis.
But officials said they were determined to provide shelter and proper sanitation and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe. 
""As of today, asylum seekers will start coming into the tents, into safe conditions,"" Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi told reporters at the site.
The need to bring the situation under control has been made more urgent by the fact that authorities have lost track of 35 camp residents who had tested positive for coronavirus.
Health authorities have promised to conduct rapid tests at the entrance of the new camp, with a quarantine unit ready for anyone testing positive.
Still, the unsanitary conditions being endured by Moria's former inhabitants in the fields and streets of Lesbos has caused deep alarm.

""This is a health bomb. These people haven't even had access to water all these days, they cannot even wash their hands,"" Matina Pagoni, president of Athens and Piraeus hospital doctors' union, told Skai television.

(Reuters) - Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Kablick sat next to her five-year-old son Peter at home in Cheverly, Maryland, as he logged on to a Zoom video call for his first week of kindergarten at a French immersion school.
Like thousands of parents in the United States this week, the registrar assistant was supervising her child's virtual schooling while working full-time. As with many schools from coast to coast, classes in the Washington, D.C., suburb reopened online to avoid the risk of COVID-19 infection.
Chaos marked the first days, said Kablick, a mother of two.
Her son and 17 classmates, many unaware of how to mute themselves on the video call, fought to concentrate on their teacher speaking a foreign language with the sound of barking dogs and bickering parents in the background.
""Sometimes it's funny, but sometimes you're just like, how is this going to go on? How can we live like this?"" Kablick said. ""It's exhausting.""
The new school year had held promise of some return to normalcy for American families since the pandemic upended daily life and made much of the spring semester unproductive. But the spread of the coronavirus over the summer set off a national debate over whether to resume in-classroom instruction.
Public schools in Los Angeles and Chicago moved all classes online and New York City has pushed back the start of its blended program, with in-person and remote classes, after teachers protested against a reopening plan they felt was unsafe.
Health experts have warned against opening where COVID-19 transmission is high. But in-person schooling has a positive psychological impact that virtual learning lacks, and is important for kids who rely on school for meals, U.S. top infectious disease official Anthony Fauci told reporters last month.
Virtual classes have shown a lower quality of learning, a Reuters survey found.
While online classes have been smoother than the haphazard online lessons thrown together in March, schools still suffer from web portals crashing, students struggle to upload assignments, and parents sweat to keep their kids focused while working, according to interviews with parents and teachers this week.
Single working parents and parents of children with special needs have a particularly tough time.
Kimberlee Bradshaw Archibald, a public relations professional, opted to keep her two children home when their schools in Ramsey, New Jersey, opened last week.
Her children, 4-year-old Gabrielle and 8-year-old Ethan, who has Down's syndrome, need lots of supervision. This week, while her husband was away, she paced between the rooms where Ethan and Gabrielle were taking separate classes while on a conference call for work.
""Two teachers and a working mom - to be those three people Monday through Friday is very hard,"" she said.
Bethany Reed, a single, working mom in Peoria, Arizona, said her son Kody, 10, has struggled to submit his homework.
""You can see the stress and the frustration on him,"" she said. ""And he's never been a kid who's worried about school.""
Still, some parents and teachers said the first days of online school this fall have been refreshingly better than last semester.
Finn Freymann, an 8th-grade English teacher at a New York City charter school, has embraced a new mindset after scrambling to help students keep up with the curriculum virtually last spring.
""Teachers are definitely settling into it as something that is not a temporary Band-aid until we can get back to the building, but it's something that needs to accomplish the same goals as regular school,"" he said.
Virtual school attendance has been higher in the first week than in the spring, two teachers said.
Some students with emotional and learning disabilities seem to be performing better at home, without classroom distractions, said Nicole Daly, a high school special education teacher in Chicago.
""I think that's been the biggest surprise, how strongly the kids have come back and are eager to learn,"" Daly said.
Technical glitches still derail learning.
In Austin, Texas, Jason Jepson said he and his wife have spent nearly six hours this week calling school district representatives because his seven-year-old daughter Harper was unable to log onto classes.
All the school's various online class platforms have crashed at different times, said Jepson, a brand communications professional who sees no choice but to bear the burden of making sure his daughter is learning.

""I have to figure out how to drink more caffeine, get less sleep and still be a good dad, because that's my only option. It's her education,"" Jepson said.

WASHINGTON/JERUSALEM/DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain joined the United Arab Emirates in agreeing to normalize relations with Israel on Friday, a move forged partly through shared fears of Iran but one that could leave the Palestinians further isolated.
U.S. President Donald Trump posted the announcement on Twitter after he spoke by phone, according to the White House, to Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
""This is truly a historic day,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, saying he believed other countries would follow suit.
""Opening direct dialogue and ties between these two dynamic societies and advanced economies will continue the positive transformation of the Middle East and increase stability, security, and prosperity in the region,"" the United States, Bahrain and Israel said in a joint statement.
Palestinians were dismayed, fearing the moves by Bahrain and its fellow Gulf Arab state, the United Arab Emirates, will weaken a longstanding pan-Arab position that calls for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory and acceptance of Palestinian statehood in return for normal relations with Arab countries.
A month ago, the UAE agreed to normalize ties with Israel under a U.S.-brokered deal scheduled to be signed at a White House ceremony on Tuesday hosted by Trump, who is seeking re-election on Nov. 3.
The ceremony is due to be attended by Netanyahu and Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan. The joint statement said Bahrain's Foreign Minister Abdullatif Al Zayani will join that ceremony and sign a ""historic Declaration of Peace"" with Netanyahu.
Netanyahu said Bahrain's decision marks a ""new era of peace.""
""For many long years, we invested in peace, and now peace will invest in us, will bring about truly major investments in Israel's economy,"" Netanyahu said in a video statement.
Emirates Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hend al-Otaiba congratulated Bahrain and Israel, saying it marked ""another significant and historic achievement which will contribute enormously to the stability and prosperity of the region.""
Bahrain, a small island state, is home to the U.S. Navy's regional headquarters. Saudi Arabia in 2011 sent troops to Bahrain to help quell an uprising and, alongside Kuwait and the UAE, in 2018 offered Bahrain a $10 billion economic bailout.
Bahrain became the fourth Arab country to reach such an agreement with Israel, which exchanged embassies with Egypt and Jordan decades ago.
A statement issued in the name of the Palestinian leadership condemned the agreement as a betrayal of the Palestinian cause.
""The Palestinian leadership rejects this step taken by the Kingdom of Bahrain and calls on it to immediately retreat from it due to the great harm it causes to the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and joint Arab action,"" the statement said.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said the Palestinian ambassador to Bahrain was called back for consultations.
In Gaza, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said Bahrain's decision to normalize relations with Israel ""represents a grave harm to the Palestinian cause, and it supports the occupation.""
Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, a special adviser on international affairs for the speaker of Iran's parliament, called Bahrain's decision a great betrayal to the Islamic cause and Palestinians.
""The imprudent leaders in UAE, #Bahrain must not pave the way for the Zionist schemes,"" the official tweeted.
EYES ON SAUDI
The forging of relations with Israel is happening against a backdrop of shared fears about the threat that Iran may pose to the region. The biggest question now is whether Saudi Arabia, one of the Middle East's most influential countries and a close U.S. ally, will follow suit.
Trump's administration has tried to coax other Sunni Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, to engage with Israel. Saudi Arabia, a key Sunni rival to Shi'ite Iran, has so far signaled it is not ready.
The agreements are taking place as Republican Trump trails Democratic challenger Joe Biden in several opinion polls ahead of the U.S. election. Foreign policy has not figured prominently in the election campaign, but Trump is eager to present himself as a peacemaker even as he rattles sabers against Iran.
Trump's pro-Israel moves have been seen, in part, as an effort to bolster his appeal to evangelical Christian voters, an important segment of his political base.
Zaha Hassan, a visiting fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Bahrain's move was ""especially disturbing"" to Palestinians.
""This move could not happen without a Saudi green light,"" she added. ""(Saudi Arabia) is under pressure to normalize, but cannot because of its position as the custodian of Islam's holy places and the unpopularity of it on the street level. Bahrain was offered up as a consolation that will keep Saudi Arabia in Trump's good graces.""
At the Arab League on Wednesday, the Palestinians sought but did not obtain a condemnation of the UAE-Israel accord from fellow members. They did secure renewed Saudi support for their right to statehood.
The Saudi embassy in Washington did not respond to queries on whether its ambassador would attend Tuesday's ceremony. 
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the agreement between Bahrain and Israel ""excellent news.""
Stopping short of endorsing the agreement, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said Israel needs to halt actions that ""undermine the two-state solution.""
Last week, Bahrain said it would allow flights between Israel and the UAE to use its airspace. This followed a Saudi decision to allow an Israeli commercial airliner to fly over it on the way to the UAE.

The United States, Israel and the UAE have urged Palestinian leaders to re-engage with Israel. Negotiations last broke down between Israelis and Palestinians in 2014, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has refused to have political dealings with the Trump White House for more than two years, accusing it of pro-Israel bias.

GAZA (Reuters) - Palestinians in Gaza burnt pictures of Israeli, U.S., Bahraini and United Arab Emirates leaders on Saturday in protest over the two Gulf countries' moves to normalize ties with Israel.
Bahrain on Friday joined the UAE in agreeing to normalize relations with Israel, a move forged partly through shared fears of Iran but one that could leave the Palestinians further isolated.
The Gaza protest, attended by a few dozen, was organized by the ruling Islamist group Hamas. 
""We have to fight the virus of normalization and block all its paths before it succeeds, to prevent it from spreading,"" said Hamas official Maher al-Holy.
Demonstrators set fire to pictures of U.S. President Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and the UAE's Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nayhan. 
While the United States, Israel, the UAE and Bahrain hail the diplomatic moves as a major step toward Middle East peace and stability, the Palestinians see it as a betrayal. 
They fear a weakening of a longstanding pan-Arab position that calls for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory and acceptance of Palestinian statehood in return for normal relations with Arab countries.
Despite a deep political rift going back to 2007, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority has limited rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and his Hamas rivals have been united against the Gulf states' move.
In the West Bank, the Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Saeb Erekat, said the diplomatic push will not achieve peace if the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not resolved first.
""The Bahraini, Israeli, American agreement to normalize relations is now part of a bigger package in the region, it isn't about peace, it is not about relations between countries. We are witnessing an alliance, a military alliance being created in the region,"" Erekat told Reuters. 

Iran meanwhile said on Saturday that Bahrain's move meant it would be complicit in Israeli policies that threatened regional security, Iranian state TV reported.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the European Union not to threaten Britain on Saturday, saying a bill which would breach a divorce treaty with the bloc was needed to protect the country's integrity.
With the EU stepping up planning for talks on trade to end without a deal, Johnson has accused its negotiators of threatening to impose a food blockade between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland.
""Let's make the EU take their threats off the table"", Johnson said on Twitter. ""And let's get this Bill through, back up our negotiators, and protect our country.""
British lawmakers will on Monday begin debating the Internal Markets Bill, which one minister has said would breach international law ""in a very specific and limited way"". 
The government says it is needed to clarify the Northern Ireland protocol element of the Brexit deal it signed in January to protect free trade between the four constituent nations of the United Kingdom 
But European lawmakers said on Friday they would not approve any new trade deal unless the withdrawal agreement was fully implemented, while there is also talk of possible legal action.
Both sides have set a deadline of the end of October for a deal, raising the prospect that nearly $1 trillion in trade between the EU and Britain could be thrown into confusion at the start of 2021 when a transition period ends. 
'GREAT DEAL'
Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Johnson said a ""great deal"" could still be done but it appeared the EU were now taking an ""extreme interpretation"" of the Northern Irish protocol.
""We never seriously believed that the EU would be willing to use a treaty, negotiated in good faith, to blockade one part of the UK, to cut it off, or that they would actually threaten to destroy the economic and territorial integrity of the UK.""
Johnson's bill also faces opposition from senior figures in his Conservative Party and some of his own lawmakers who are unhappy at the prospect of infringing international law.
In a video conference call with his lawmakers on Friday he appealed for support for his bill and for them to avoid repeating the ""squabbling"" over the Brexit divorce deal which saw some quit the party and others thrown out.
Michael Gove, one of Johnson's most senior ministers, said the government had the support of its own lawmakers and those in other parties. But some were clearly unconvinced. 
""Unamended I cannot support this Bill ... (it) is damaging brand UK, diminishing our role-model status as defender of global standards,"" Conservative lawmaker Tobias Ellwood and chairman of parliament's defence committee wrote on Twitter.

Pushed on whether Britain would be breaking international law, Gove said the bill was consistent with ""the rule of law"" and denied it was a negotiating tactic to put pressure on the EU to make concessions for a trade deal.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A group of Hong Kong families on Saturday demanded the urgent return of their activist relatives detained last month by mainland Chinese authorities as they tried to flee the city by boat to Taiwan.
Relatives of six of the 12 detained activists donned masks and hats to shield their identities as they made their first public appeal for help and information on their plight, supported by several local pro-democracy politicians. 
Some sobbed and wept as they issued several demands, including that those detained be allowed to consult lawyers appointed by the families and not the Chinese government and should be allowed to call their relatives in Hong Kong.
""I can't imagine what's the worst case scenario,"" said a woman surnamed Li, whose son Li Tsz-yin, 29, is among those being held in a detention centre in the southern city of Shenzhen.
They said they still had no information on the charges faced by their relatives, and the Hong Kong government had given no concrete assistance. A boy aged 16 is the youngest being held.
The Chinese Coast Guard Bureau said in a post on its social media site on Aug. 27 that it had arrested at least 10 people on Aug. 23 after intercepting a boat off the coast of the southern province of Guangdong.
Hong Kong media, citing unidentified sources, said the 12 were headed to Taiwan to apply for political asylum. Their arrests come as local activists and politicians fear a worsening clamp-down across the former British colony as a sweeping new national security law imposed by Beijing in July takes full effect.
Hours before the families' appearance, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States was deeply concerned about the activists, saying they had been denied to access to lawyers and local authorities had not provided any information on their welfare or the charges against them. 
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said earlier this week that if they had been arrested for breaking mainland law ""then they have to dealt with according to the mainland laws.""

Chen Shih-chung told reporters in Taipei that the government had engaged lawyers to enter discussions about signing onto the scheme.
Taiwan is also researching its own vaccine, a process Chen said was going smoothly.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the GAVI vaccine alliance are leading the COVAX facility, aimed at helping buy and fairly distribute vaccination shots against the novel coronavirus around the world. 
But some countries which have secured their own supplies through bilateral deals, including the United States, have said they will not join COVAX.
Taiwan has reported fewer than 500 coronavirus cases, including seven deaths, thanks to early and effective prevention steps such as entry bans for most foreign visitors and tough quarantine requirements for those who do come to the island.
While Taiwan is not a WHO member due to pressure from China, which considers the island its own territory, the WHO has said it is committed to providing Taiwan with the help it needs during the pandemic.

The GAVI alliance is a public-private partnership backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the WHO, the World Bank, UNICEF and others.

PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - Deadly wildfires raging across Oregon kept half a million people under evacuation alert on Friday even as weary firefighters took advantage of improved weather to go on the offensive against the blazes.
The fires have destroyed thousands of homes in days, making Oregon the latest epicenter in a larger summer outbreak of fires sweeping the western United States, collectively scorching a landscape the size of New Jersey and killing at least 25 people.
At least five people died in Oregon this week. Governor Kate Brown has warned the death toll could grow far higher and said on Friday that dozens of people had been reported missing in three counties.
Oregon Office of Emergency Management chief Andrew Phelps said disaster teams searching the scorched ruins of a half-dozen small towns laid to waste were bracing to encounter possible ""mass fatality incidents."" 
The Pacific Northwest as a whole has borne the brunt of an incendiary onslaught that began around Labor Day, darkening the sky with smoke and ash that has beset northern California, Oregon and Washington with some of the world's worst air-quality levels.
The firestorms, some of the largest on record in California and Oregon, were driven by high winds that howled across the region for days in the midst of record-breaking heat. Scientists say global warming has also contributed to extremes in wet and dry seasons, causing vegetation to flourish then dry out, leaving more abundant fuel for wildfires.
'THE PERFECT STORM'
""This is a climate damn emergency. This is real and it's happening. This is the perfect storm,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom told reporters from a charred mountainside near Oroville, California. 
More than 3,900 homes and other structures have been incinerated in California alone over the past three weeks. 
In southern Oregon, an apocalyptic scene of charred residential subdivisions and trailer parks stretched for miles along Highway 99 south of Medford through the neighboring towns of Phoenix and Talent, one of the most devastated areas.
Molalla, a community about 25 miles (40 km) south of downtown Portland, was an ash-covered ghost town after its more than 9,000 residents were told to evacuate, with only 30 refusing to leave, the city's fire department said.
The logging town was on the front line of a vast evacuation zone stretching north to within 3 miles (4.8 km) of downtown Portland. The sheriff in suburban Clackamas County set a 10 p.m. PDT (0500 on Saturday GMT) curfew to deter ""possible increased criminal activity."" 
Governor Brown told a news conference that more than 500,000 people were under one of three evacuation alert levels, advising them to pack and be vigilant, to be ready to flee at a moment's notice, or to leave immediately. About 40,000 of those had already been ordered to leave.
In neighboring Washington state, online video from the Tacoma area showed fires in a residential area setting homes ablaze and locals scurrying to warn neighbors.
""Everybody out, everybody out!"" a man screamed as firefighters tried to douse the flames. 
BREAK IN THE WEATHER
After four days of treacherously hot, windy weather, a glimmer of hope arrived in the form of calmer winds blowing in from the ocean, bringing cooler, moister conditions that helped firefighters make headway against blazes that had burned largely unchecked earlier in the week.
""The weather is going to be favorable for us,"" said Doug Grafe, fire protection chief for the Oregon Department of Forestry, adding that the break in the weather was forecast to continue into next week.
The overall death toll from the Western fires that began in August jumped to 25 after seven people were reported killed in mountains north of Sacramento, California, and Oregon's fifth fatality was reported in Marion County, outside of Salem, the state capital.
Paradise, a town blasted by California's deadliest wildfire in 2018, posted the world's worst air quality index reading at 592, according to the PurpleAir monitoring site, as two of the state's largest blazes burned on either side of it.
In southern Oregon, police arrested a 42-year-old man on Friday for starting a fire in the town of Phoenix, the Jackson County Sheriff's office said. 

The suspect named Michael Bakkela, described as a ""local transient"", has been charged with arson, criminal mischief and reckless endangering, the office said in a press release.

The five were Indian intelligence agents dressed as hunters, the paper said, disputing claims that they had been kidnapped.
Bilateral relations have been unusually tense since a clash at a disputed border area in June that killed 20 Indian soldiers, with an unknown number of Chinese casualties. [L4N2E215E]
On Tuesday, following reports that five Indians from the state of Arunachal Pradesh, which borders China's Tibet, had gone missing, an Indian minister said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army confirmed they had been found in China.
Their disappearance coincided with a border confrontation that week in the western Himalayas, during which both accused the other of firing in the air.
The two sides have long observed a protocol avoiding the use of firearms in the undemarcated frontier, though violence has erupted in the past. 
On Thursday, Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi and Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar met in Moscow and agreed to de-escalate the border tensions.
Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin said on the Chinese Twitter-like app Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) that China-India relations were stabilising. Observers of China's foreign relations often watch Hu's messages on social media to gauge sentiment from Beijing policymakers.
""It seems that the successive meetings between the Chinese and Indian defence ministers and foreign ministers have played a positive role in cooling the situation,"" Hu wrote.
""In addition, the People's Liberation Army defended every inch of the country's land, and the Indian Army ultimately failed to take advantage of it.""

YUZAWA, Japan (Reuters) - Yoshihide Suga, used to suits, a lectern and the trappings of the Japanese government, now finds himself on hip hop T-shirts and bags in his hometown, where the locals are celebrating the man expected to become prime minister in a few days.
Designer Ippei Fujita and Suga, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, both hail from the rural city of Yuzawa in northern Japan. The prospect of Suga completing the rise from humble beginnings to the nation's highest office is a source of pride for local townsfolk. 
Suga, 71, is widely expected to win the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership race on Monday and become premier thanks to the party's majority in the lower house of parliament.
""I heard the news he might become prime minister and then it became a high possibility,"" Fujita told Reuters at his store Marble in central Yuzawa. ""I thought Yuzawa would also attract attention. Suga is from Yuzawa - me too. And together I wanted to get people excited.""
Many Japanese leaders have come from prominent political families, including outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is stepping down because of health problems.
By contrast, Suga grew up in the Yuzawa farming community of Akinomiya in Akita prefecture, before moving to Tokyo after high school, where he worked part-time to pay for university.
A tote bag Fujita designed reads in English, ""SUGA Represent Akinomiya, Yuzawa, JAPAN"". The hip hop design-inspired T-shirts read, ""SUGA YOSHIHIDE REP AKITA YUZAWA"".
""I'm doing hip hop activities and I wanted to bring out the hip hop style. Like in a flyer for a hip hop event, or the cover of a magazine, those kind of designs,"" Fujita said.
He said the merchandise would go on sale on Wednesday, the day Suga is expected to become prime minister, with prices ranging from 3,900 yen ($36) for the T-shirts to 1,200 yen for the smallest bag.
Japan's love of cuteness also played a factor in some designs.
""The chief cabinet secretary isn't cute, but when I created these products I thought 'cute' would probably sell better,"" he said with a laugh.

China News Service said on Saturday that the raids ""grossly violated the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese media reporters stationed in Australia, and caused serious damage to the physical and mental health of journalists and their families.""
That followed similar comments by Xinhua news agency, which said late on Friday that the actions taken by Australian authorities were ""utterly appalling"" and damaged relations between the two countries.
China's state-backed tabloid Global Times reported earlier this week that Australian authorities raided the homes of four Chinese journalists residing in the country in June.
""This gross, imperious and unreasonable act was utterly appalling. It fully exposes the Cold-War mentality and political prejudice of some Australian departments and officials,"" a Xinhua spokesperson said, according to the agency.
""What they have done not only seriously harms the reputation and image of Chinese media, but also seriously interferes with the normal people-to-people exchanges between China and Australia,"" added the spokesperson, who was not identified. 
Australia's trade minister on Friday responded to the reports, saying that security agencies had acted in accordance with the law.
Relations between the two countries have become increasingly fraught over a host of issues ranging from Australian accusations of Chinese meddling in domestic affairs to trade disputes and calls by Canberra for an international enquiry into the origins of the novel coronavirus.
News of the raids coincided with the exit of two Australian journalists from China.
The pair returned home with the help of consular officials after China's state security visited their residences in Beijing and Shanghai and questioned them. 

Another Australian citizen, Chinese television anchor Cheng Lei, was detained by Chinese authorities in August.

""The choice of your political system is yours to make,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the two sides at the opening ceremony for the talks in the Qatari capital Doha.
The talks, which are scheduled to commence on Sunday, will require hard work and sacrifice, but through them an endurable peace is possible, Pompeo said of the 19-year war, which has vexed three U.S. presidents.
The head of Afghanistan's peace council, Abdullah Abdullah, said that if the two sides join hands ""and honestly work for peace, the current ongoing misery in the country will end.""
Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, foreign minister of host Qatar, said the long-warring parties ""must make the decisive decision in line with the current challenges and rise above all form of division... by reaching an agreement on the basis of no victor and no vanquished. 
Officials, diplomats and analysts say that although getting both sides to the negotiating table was an achievement, this does not mean the path to peace will be easy.
""The negotiations will have to tackle a range of profound questions about the kind of country Afghans want,"" Deborah Lyons, the United Nations special representative for Afghanistan, told the U.N Security Council this month.
The opening ceremony comes one day after the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the United States that triggered its military involvement in Afghanistan.
U.S. forces intervened in Afghanistan on the orders of President George W. Bush a month after the attacks to hunt down their mastermind, Osama bin Laden, a Saudi who had been given sanctuary by the country's radical Islamist Taliban rulers. U.S. forces initially offered mainly air support to the Taliban's local enemies.
Although the Taliban regime was quickly toppled, they regrouped and have since waged an insurgency that has sucked in Afghanistan's neighbours and troops from dozens of countries, including NATO forces.
Negotiations to broker a comprehensive peace deal were envisaged in a troop withdrawal pact signed between the United States and the Taliban in February. After months of delay, a dispute over the Taliban's demand for the release of 5,000 prisoners was resolved this week.
Ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, President Donald Trump is looking to show progress in his pledge to end U.S. involvement and pull out most of the foreign forces stationed in Afghanistan.
The United States has reduced its troop levels and by November is expected to have fewer than 5,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, down from about 13,000 when the U.S.-Taliban deal was signed. Since 2001, more than 2,300 U.S. troops and about 450 British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan.
A European diplomat in Kabul said that a ceasefire - which the Taliban have so far rejected - should top the talks' agenda.
""The Taliban leaders will have to stop fighters from attacking Afghan forces and civilians, violence continues to degrade the atmosphere and potentially derail negotiations,"" the diplomat said.
How to include the Taliban, who reject the legitimacy of the Western-backed Afghan government, in any governing arrangement and how to safeguard the rights of women and minorities who suffered under Taliban rule are big challenges, experts said.
Nevertheless many diplomats, victims of violence and members of civil society say negotiations are the only realistic way to bring an end to a conflict that has killed more than 100,000 civilians and hampered Afghanistan's development, leaving millions in poverty.

""Solutions will not be found on the battlefield, we know this,"" Lyons said.

With total cases of more than 4.65 million, India is the world's second worst affected country, trailing only the United States, which has more than 6.4 million cases.
But the growth in infections in India is faster than anywhere else in the world, as cases surge through urban and rural areas.
The western state of Maharashtra has been particularly hard-hit, with total confirmed cases breaching the 1 million mark late on Friday, making it the first state or province anywhere in the world to cross that mark.
If the state, which is India's richest, were a country, it would rival Russia for the fourth highest number of coronavirus cases globally.
Government officials and experts said the unabated rise in cases in Maharashtra and other parts of the country were likely a result of economic activity re-starting, local festivals and lockdown fatigue.
""I am so disappointed with the pandemic situation in India,"" Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan, who has been tracking India's COVID situation closely, said on Twitter.

""It is getting worse and worse each week but a large part of the nation seems to have made the choice to ignore this crisis,"" she said.

(Reuters) - A federal appeals court ruled on Friday that Florida can require felons to pay all fines, restitution and legal fees they face before they can regain their right to vote, reversing a lower court ruling that held the measure unconstitutional. 
The ruling, by the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, could influence the election outcome in November. 
Florida is considered a must-win in President Donald's Trump's bid for re-election and disenfranchised felons account for a significant voting bloc in a state with a history of tight elections. 
The dispute, which could ultimately head to U.S. Supreme Court, centers on whether the law is a way around a voter-approved 2018 measure that aimed to end the state's lifetime prohibition on voting by ex-felons. 
The Republican-controlled Florida legislature passed the law the following year, requiring all former felons to pay off outstanding court debts and legal fees to be eligible to vote.
Voting and civil rights groups sued the state's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, and state election officials over that requirement.
U.S. District Court Judge Robert Hinkle in May struck down most of the law as unconstitutional, describing it as a ""pay to vote"" scheme. 
The appeals court, dominated by judges appointed by Trump, delayed the decision while it considered on appeal.
On Friday, a majority of the 11-judge panel found the defendants in the case failed to prove the measure violated the constitution, noting the country has a long history of placing restrictions on voting. 
The decision was met with frustration by voting rights groups.

""Florida’s voters spoke loud and clear when nearly two-thirds of them supported rights restoration at the ballot box in 2018,"" said Paul Smith, vice president at Campaign Legal Center. ""Nobody should ever be denied their constitutional rights because they can’t afford to pay fines and fees.""

ECATEPEC, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican activists protesting violence against women set part of a building belonging to a government rights commission on fire in central Mexico on Friday.
After spraying the building with graffiti, roughly 25 masked women broke down a door, entered the building and started a fire inside, a Reuters witness said. 
The women then left the building and hurled molotov cocktails at its exterior walls, according to the witness.
Thirteen women were arrested by police, the State of Mexico government said. They were later released after an outcry on social media about their apparent rough treatment.
Demanding justice for murdered women in cases that have not been solved or even properly investigated, activists have also occupied the main offices of the country's federal human rights commission in Mexico City over the past week.
Intense media coverage of the protests have helped reignite debate about topic and spurred demonstrations in other cities across the country. The protests have also focused on Mexico's more than 73,000 missing people. 
Femicides, the murder of women due to their gender, rose 5.4% between January and July in Mexico from the same period last year, according to official data. In July alone, 74 women were murdered. 
The federal rights commission has urged authorities to not hurt protesters.
The governor of the State of Mexico, Alfredo del Mazo, said on Twitter he condemned the actions of the police on Friday and promised an investigation into the incident.

State government prosecutors said in a statement that protocols had been followed in the arrest of the 13 women.

The coalition launched nine air strikes on a military engineering camp and the headquarters of the national security apparatus, they said.
The spokesman for the coalition-backed Yemeni forces in Hodeidah, Waddah Al-Debeish, said the coalition had targeted a meeting of high-level Houthi leaders at the camp. 
There was no immediate official confirmation from the Saudi-led coalition.
Bombings in Sanaa city have been relatively rare since September 2019, when Saudi Arabia launched indirect talks with the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which it has been at war with since 2015. The conflict has led to what the United Nations describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
Saturday's strikes come after the Houthi group said it had attacked an ""important target"" in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Thursday using a ballistic missile and drones.
The Saudi-led coalition did not confirm an attack on Riyadh but said it had intercepted and destroyed a number of ballistic missiles and explosive drones launched towards the kingdom on Thursday.
Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said six strikes were aimed at a military engineering camp on Saturday.
The Houthis took over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and most other cities in 2014 after ousting the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
The Western-backed coalition that Saudi Arabia leads intervened to try to restore Hadi to power. The war, which has killed 100,000 people, has been stuck in a stalemate for years.

In a live broadcast on state television, Maduro said the man was arrested on Thursday in the northwest state of Falcon where he was spying on the Amuay and Cardon oil refineries. 
They captured ""a marine, who was serving as a marine on CIA bases in Iraq,"" Maduro said. ""He was captured with specialized weapons, he was captured with large amounts of cash, large amounts of dollars and other items."" 
Maduro did not give further details, but said the detainee was giving a statement in custody.
Neither the U.S. State Department nor the White House immediately responded to requests for comment.
Amuay and Cardon make up the Paraguana Refining Center, which has a nominal processing capacity of 971,000 barrels per day. Both have experienced multiple outages in recent years that the opposition blames on mismanagement and lack of maintenance. 
Word of the alleged U.S. spy came after a Venezuelan court last month sentenced two former U.S. Green Berets to 20 years in prison for their role in a failed incursion in May. 
Separately during Friday's broadcast, Maduro said that in recent days security forces had also foiled a plot to cause an explosion at another oil refinery, El Palito in Carabobo state. He did not elaborate. 

Hit by U.S. sanctions that have exacerbated acute fuel shortages, the government on Friday announced a new fuel distribution initiative and said it was planning new refining projects, without providing further details.

BERLIN/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Berlin prosecutors said on Friday they would investigate the case of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who is being treated in Berlin for suspected poisoning, and hand information to Moscow - if he agreed.
The German government had earlier said it would not investigate the case because the poisoning took place in Russia.
It has accused Russia of trying to poison Navalny and demanded an explanation from Moscow for what it said was the banned Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok found in his body by German doctors after he was airlifted from Russia for treatment.
Moscow has insisted it has seen no evidence he was poisoned and earlier on Friday said it would ask to send investigators to Berlin in response to the German demands.
The prosecutor's office in the German capital said it had been commissioned by the regional justice department ""to provide legal assistance over the Russian request for legal assistance and to obtain information on the state of health of A. Navalny - subject to his consent"".
Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's highest-profile critic, was flown to Germany last month after falling violently ill while travelling in Siberia. He is very unlikely to agree to Germany sharing information with the Russian government, which his supporters have accused of attempted murder.
Some senior German politicians have said Berlin should revoke support for Nord Stream 2, a big gas pipeline from Russia to Germany set to open next year. Such a move would amount to the most drastic economic penalty the West has imposed on Russia since the Soviet era.
The transport department of Russia's interior ministry in Siberia said it wanted to send investigators to work alongside German colleagues on the case, after reports that Navalny had emerged from a coma.
""This request will include an application for the possible presence of Russian internal affairs investigators ... and a Russian specialist when German colleagues are conducting investigations with Navalny, doctors and experts,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Russia has not opened a criminal investigation and is sticking to its position that it would first need hard evidence from Germany that Navalny was poisoned. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday that German accusations over the case were ""groundless"".
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow resented foreign pressure over the case. It had investigated the incident but did not have evidence that would lead to a criminal case, he said.
""Of course, we do not like it when other countries dictate to us what legal procedures we have at what point and on what basis to start them,"" Peskov said. ""We cannot call these checks and inquiries a criminal case on the basis of analysis by a German laboratory ... legally, it is not possible."" 
The Russian interior ministry said transport police in Tomsk had established a timeline of events leading up to Navalny's illness. The ministry listed a hotel, restaurant, flat and coffee shop Navalny had visited, and said he had drunk wine and an alcoholic cocktail. In the days after he fell ill, Navalny's spokeswoman denied allegations he had consumed alcohol.
The Russian ministry said police had interviewed five of six people it said accompanied Navalny when he fell ill.

Police were looking for a sixth person the ministry named as Marina Pevchikh, a UK resident who flew to Germany on Aug. 22, and whose whereabouts it said were being established. This appeared to be a reference to Maria Pevchikh, an activist and ally of Navalny. Reuters was not immediately able to reach her for comment.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra faced a fresh challenge to his leadership on Friday after Congress approved a motion to start impeachment proceedings against him over leaked audio tapes and alleged ties to a singer involved in a fraud case.
Whether to remove Vizcarra from office for ""moral incapacity"" is due to be debated and voted upon in the next week, which risks plunging the world's second-largest copper producer further into crisis as it battles one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks globally amid its deepest recession in decades. Vizcarra vowed not to resign.
Fifty-two votes from the 130-member Congress were needed to approve the start of impeachment proceedings, and impeachment itself needs 87 votes in order to remove Vizcarra from office. Friday's vote was 65 in favor, 36 opposed and 24 abstentions.
Lawmakers in Peru's Congress, a mosaic of parties from the left and right with no overall majority, heard recordings of two private conversations between Vizcarra and government officials about meetings with Richard Cisneros, a little-known singer. 
Cisneros, who goes as Richard Swing, was awarded government contracts for motivational talks worth 175,400 soles ($49,500), which are being investigated by Congress and Peru's auditor general along with claims of alleged links to the presidency.
Lawmakers said the recordings revealed Vizcarra attempting to downplay his meetings with Cisneros. 
Vizcarra took office two years ago after former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's resignation over allegations of corruption. Last September, Vizcarra faced down a previous attempt to impeach him for incapacity and dissolved Congress.
He told reporters on Friday that the new challenge represented ""a plot to destabilize the government.""
""I am not going to resign, I have a commitment to Peru and I will fulfill it until the last day of my mandate,"" he said. 
Presidential elections are due to be held next year and Vizcarra has already said he will not run again. 
""We now hope Vizcarra will come to give his justifications,"" said lawmaker Edgar Alarcon, head of the congressional oversight commission who shared the audios in Congress. 
Alarcon added that the date for the debate was being discussed but was expected to be late next week.
Julio Ruiz, an economist specializing in Peru for the Brazilian bank Itaú BBA, said the new turmoil risked adding to jitters from recent ""market unfriendly"" measures, a reference to Congress passing laws allowing Peruvians to withdraw early from their pensions funds, and a separate recent bid to push out the country's economy minister.

""If this continues to escalate, it could have an effect on recovery,"" Ruiz said.

Carlos Gomez Arrieta, who oversaw the Federal Ministerial Police at the time of the abduction and apparent massacre of 43 student teachers from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College, had faced an arrest order since March, the interior ministry said. 
Coming just two weeks before the incident's six-year anniversary, his surrender and detention could mark a step forward in President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's push to resolve a case that became a symbol of Mexico's failure to tackle violence, corruption and impunity.
Accusations against Gomez include ""probable participation"" in torture and forced disappearance of some people who were questioned in the probe, the interior ministry said in a statement.
The United Nations human rights office has accused authorities under the prior government of torturing dozens of people in connection with the investigation.
Gomez last year resigned from his then-post in Michoacan state's police after he was identified in a video that appeared to show police using torture to interrogate a suspect.
Gomez has denied the use of torture.
Felipe De La Cruz, the father of one of the missing student teachers, called on Gomez to break an alleged ""pact of silence.""
""We hope that ... he can also say where the kids are and who else participated in their disappearance,"" De La Cruz said.
Investigators in July found a bone fragment belonging to one of the student teachers, which authorities said could open new leads into the case. 
Before that, the remains of just one student teacher had been definitively identified.
Arrest warrants are still pending for over 40 public officials, including Tomas Zeron, the former head of Mexico's criminal investigation agency.

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - The judge in the criminal case against four former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd's death disqualified four local prosecutors on Friday because of ""sloppy"" work, while a special prosecutor said the defendants had ""acted together"" and should face trial together.
The hearing before Hennepin County District Court Judge Peter Cahill focused on various motions in the criminal case arising from Floyd's death, which led to protests in the United States and other countries against racism and police brutality.
It was the first time all four defendants - Derek Chauvin, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao - appeared together since the May 25 death of Floyd, who was Black. Chauvin, who is white, knelt on Floyd's neck for about nine minutes. He faces the most serious charge of second-degree murder.
While Cahill did not rule on any major motions, he dealt a blow to the prosecution by disqualifying Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman and three other lawyers in his office from participating in the case because of a meeting they had with the medical examiner with no outside attorneys present. The medical examiner is the official who looked into the cause of death.
""It was sloppy not to have someone present. Those four attorneys are off the case,"" Cahill said. ""They are now witnesses.""
After the hearing, Floyd's relatives and lawyers pushed back against the assertion made by defense attorneys in court filings that Floyd, who had the powerful opioid pain medication fentanyl in his system, died of an overdose rather than cardiopulmonary arrest, the official cause of death.
""The only overdose that killed George Floyd was an overdose of excessive force and racism by the Minneapolis Police Department,"" lawyer Ben Crump said outside the courthouse. ""It is a blatant attempt to kill George Floyd a second time.""
Chauvin was wearing a gray suit, dark shirt and tie, and blue surgical mask amid the coronavirus pandemic. He appeared thinner than on the bystander videos that showed the incident.
Neal Katyal, a special attorney for the state, said a joint trial was justified given that the evidence was similar for all four defendants and because separate trials would force relatives to repeatedly relive the trauma of Floyd's death.
""I have seen a lot in my life, and I can barely watch the videos,"" Katyal, a lawyer and the U.S. Justice Department's former acting solicitor general, said about the bystander videos of Chauvin pinning Floyd to the pavement. 
""These defendants acted together, they were on the scene together, they were talking to each other during the nine minutes Floyd was on the ground,"" Katyal said.
Kueng, Lane and Thao have all been charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for not taking action to help Floyd.
All four defendants have opposed a prosecution motion to consolidate their cases into one trial. They have requested that their cases be moved outside Minneapolis and have filed motions to dismiss the charges.
Robert Paule, an attorney for Thao, said combining the cases would force him to defend against the prosecution and navigate the potentially conflicting interests of the other defendants.
""You are bringing in a group of bobcats in a bag and letting them loose in a courtroom at all once,"" Paule told the hearing.
More than 100 protesters gathered outside the Family Justice Center in Minneapolis, which was barricaded with a fence and concrete blocks, chanting ""Black lives matter,"" ""no justice, no peace"" and ""indict, convict, send those killer cops to jail.""
Cahill said it was premature to decide whether to move the trial. He said he wanted to send a questionnaire to potential jurors to see how they had been affected by media coverage, and whether a fair jury could be selected in Hennepin County.

Cahill said he was leaning toward having an anonymous jury, citing potential security threats. The judge said a trial would likely last six weeks, including two weeks for jury selection.

The main candidate standing against President Alexander Lukashenko in the Aug. 9 election, Tsikhanouskaya fled to neighbouring Lithuania after the vote, which her followers say she won.
An English teacher and political novice, she emerged as the consensus opposition candidate after better known figures, including her own jailed activist husband, were barred from standing.
""You and I all understand that I would want to celebrate a birthday in Belarus, with my husband and my children. But our country is going through a rough patch right now,"" she told a crowd of few hundred Belarusians living in Lithuania.
A table set up for gifts held chocolate and a teddy bear as well as bouquets of red and white flowers, colours of Belarus' old flag and now a protest symbol.
Participants were invited to write to letters to Belarusians detained at about 100 locations. 
""It was very scary, every day I was waiting for searches or detentions. I was always afraid,"" Tskihanouskaya told the crowd of her time in Belarus.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani journalist who has been a vocal critic of the military, government, and religious extremist groups, has been arrested on charges of defaming the country's powerful army and spreading religious hatred, police said on Friday.
""Through his (social media) posts, Bilal Farooqi defamed the Pakistan Army and anti-state elements used these posts for their vested interests,"" said a police report seen by Reuters, which added that his online activity also spread religious hatred and incited mutiny against the military. 
Farooqi's arrest is the latest in a spate of such moves against journalists who have been critical of the government and comes days after Prime Minister Imran Khan reiterated that Pakistan has a free media.
In July, another journalist, Matiullah Jan, also a critic of Pakistan's military and government, was freed hours after being abducted after his disappearance sparked outcry amongst journalists and rights activists.
No explanation was given for Jan's abduction.
In the case of Farooqi, police cited the country's cyber crime law, which critics say contains vague language that can be used to criminalise basic online activities with fines and long-term imprisonment.
Online criticism of religion, the country, its courts and armed forces are among subjects attracting prosecution.
Earlier this week, a former journalist returned home days after disappearing from Islamabad. He has given no details about what happened to him.
Farooqi had written a tweet about the man's ""enforced disappearance,"" saying: ""The powerful are above the law in this country.""
Last year, journalist Shahzeb Jilani was charged under laws relating to cyber terrorism, hate speech, electronic fraud, incitement, and defamation, but the case was thrown out of court due to lack of evidence.
At least four journalists and bloggers have been killed in connection with their reporting in the last year in Pakistan.
Earlier this week, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed increasing concern at instances of incitement to violence against journalists and human rights defenders.
""We have raised our concerns directly with the government and we have urged immediate, concrete steps to ensure the protection of journalists and human rights defenders who have been subjected to threats,"" UNHCR said in a statement.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest fell in August, from the same month a year ago, preliminary government data showed on Friday, even as fires in the region are worsening.
Roughly 1,359 square kilometers (525 square miles) of jungle were cleared in August, an area larger than Los Angeles, according to space research agency Inpe. That is the fifth highest month on record, though 21% lower than August 2019.
In the first eight months of the year, deforestation dropped 5% from the same period last year, to about 6,100 square kilometers. 
While monthly deforestation eases from a record peak last year, environmentalists, scientists and international investors say the destruction remains out of control.
The asset management wing of Nordea, one of the Nordic's largest banks, said the continued destruction calls into question whether the trade deal between the European Union and South American trade bloc Mercosur should go forward. 
The deal, pending ratification, is seen as a boon for Brazilian agricultural exports, but European politicians have raised concerns that it could boost environmental destruction.
""The level of deforestation is still much too high,"" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management, which manages 223 billion euros in assets.
""The issue is now whether there is still time to show sufficient improvement for the EU-Mercosur agreement to be ratified as planned. The indications we are getting is that this really is an open question right now.""
Environmental advocates and scientists blame the policies of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for soaring deforestation, with the five highest months on record for deforestation all occurring since he took office in January 2019. They say Bolsonaro has rolled back environmental protections and called for development of the Amazon, emboldening illegal loggers and land squatters to destroy the forest.
Bolsonaro defends his policies, saying development will raise the region out of poverty. He has authorized the military to combat deforestation and forest fires from May to November this year.
Meanwhile, fires in the Amazon in the first 10 days of September are up 85% compared with the same period last year, according to Inpe data.
""I saw the numbers. I'm scared,"" said Ane Alencar, science director at Brazil's Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM).
In August, fires likely reached a decade high, an Inpe scientist told Reuters.
Deforestation and forest fires this year have emitted 226 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to annual emissions of 48.8 million cars, according to a calculation by IPAM and U.S.-based Woodwell Climate Research Center.

Western countries dispute the outcome of an Aug. 9 election which official results show President Alexander Lukashenko won, and the EU is aiming for economic sanctions.
""The ongoing deterioration of the human rights situation in Belarus in relation to the 2020 presidential election needs the urgent attention of the Human Rights Council,"" Germany's Ambassador to the United Nations Michael von Ungern-Sternberg wrote to the Geneva-based council.
The ambassador, whose nation holds the EU rotating presidency, added that he would request a resolution after the debate.
He did not elaborate on the human rights issues in Belarus though others have voiced concerns about reported kidnappings and threats to opposition figures since the vote.
A schedule of the rights council showed the item would be discussed on Monday, the opening day of a three-week session held in Geneva. 
Lukashenko denies rigging the election and has refused to talk to the opposition, accusing them of trying to wreck the former Soviet republic.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Friday for authorities in Belarus ""to refrain from the use of force against those engaging in peaceful assembly and to ensure that allegations of torture and other mistreatment of people in detention are fully investigated and addressed.""

Ouattara made his appeal to religious leaders during a tour of the east of the country on Friday. A source in Ouattara's office told Reuters that informal discussions have been held with political leaders.
The world's top cocoa-producing nation has seen a spate of violent protests, with a least 10 killed and over a hundred wounded in clashes between protesters and police since Ouattara announced his bid in August.
The election is seen as the greatest test yet for stability since a brief civil war killed about 3,000 people following a disputed election in 2010 won by Ouattara. 
Ouattara plans to run in the Oct. 31 election after the sudden death of his handpicked successor, Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly in July. 
His opponents say the constitution forbids him because he has already had two terms. The Ivory Coast Constitutional Council is set to rule on his eligibility, and those of other candidates next week.

Prime Minister Hamed Bakayoko is expected to meet youth leaders of the main opposition parties next week to restart discussions, and end street violence before the election, a government statement said on Friday.

""It's taken us longer than I wish that it had to get from February 29 to here but we expect Saturday morning ... to have the Afghans sitting at the table together prepared to have what will be contentious discussions about how to move their country forward,"" Pompeo told reporters shortly after taking off from Washington on Thursday evening. ""(It's) truly historic.""
The Trump administration has been attempting to usher the Taliban and Afghan government towards negotiations, which would pave the way for the United States to finally withdraw from its longest war and hand President Donald Trump an important foreign policy success ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.
United States Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad told journalists on a conference call on Friday that the negotiations would be a ""test for both sides.""
""This is a new phase in diplomacy for peace in Afghanistan. Now we are entering a process that is Afghan-owned and Afghan-led,"" he said, adding that the United States would continue to monitor and engage with both sides.
Earlier, a team representing the Afghan government flew from Kabul to Doha for the inauguration ceremony.
""Today, we depart to Doha with hopes and self confidence to create a condition in Afghanistan where guns are silent and the values of (the) republic are consolidated and Afghan people achieve what they deserve,"" said senior negotiator Nader Nadery, part of the team that left Kabul on a commercial airliner.
After Saturday's events, actual talks are expected to begin between the Afghan government representatives and the Taliban, as envisaged in a February agreement between the militant group the United States.
Pompeo's arrival in Doha on Friday coincided with the 19th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the United States that triggered U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan against the Taliban, who harboured Osama bin Laden, the al Qaeda militant leader who plotted the attacks. 
A diplomatic source in Kabul said the start of talks had been arranged to ensure it did not fall on the anniversary.
A jet picked up six prisoners demanded by the Taliban from Kabul on Thursday. Some Western governments had objected to their release, and as a compromise it was agreed that they would be kept under supervision in Qatar. 
""This was an Afghan decision, a decision that was difficult, but necessary,"" Khalilzad told reporters. 

France and Australia said overnight that they objected to the prisoners being released from Afghan prisons.

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union stepped up planning for a ""no-deal"" Brexit on Friday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government refused to revoke a plan to break the divorce treaty that Brussels says will sink four years of talks.
Britain said explicitly this week that it plans to break international law by breaching parts of the Withdrawal Agreement treaty that it signed in January, when it formally left the bloc.
Britain says the move is aimed at clarifying ambiguities, but it caused a new crisis in talks less than four months before a post-Brexit transition period ends in December.
European Parliament lawmakers said on Friday they will not approve any new EU-UK trade deal unless Britain fully implements its earlier divorce deal. The chamber must approve any such trade deal for it to be enacted.
If the UK authorities breach the divorce deal, or threaten to do so, then ""the European Parliament will, under no circumstances, ratify any agreement between the EU and the UK,"" the parliament's Brexit group and the heads of the parliamentary political groups said in a statement. 
Investment banks have increased their estimates of the chances of a messy end to Britain's exit from the EU. Sterling dipped to 5-1/2-month lows on Friday.
A deputy head of the bloc's executive, Maros Sefcovic, said on Friday that ""it is now up to the UK government to re-establish trust"". Sefcovic spoke after informing EU lawmakers of his unsuccessful talks the previous day in London where he demanded that Britain scrap by the end of this month the plan to breach the divorce treaty. 
Britain has refused, saying its parliament is sovereign above international law.
""As the United Kingdom looks to what kind of future trade relationship it wants with the European Union, a prerequisite for that is honouring agreements that are already in place,"" said Pascal Donohoe, chairman of euro zone finance ministers.
As the atmosphere soured between London and Brussels, Japan and Britain said they had reached agreement in principle on a bilateral trade deal that meant 99% of the Britain's exports to Japan would be tariff-free.
NO DEAL
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday the bloc was increasing its planning for a no-deal Brexit at the end of this year after trade talks made little progress.
""The UK has not engaged in a reciprocal way on fundamental EU principles and interests,"" Barnier said. ""Nobody should underestimate the practical, economic and social consequences of a 'no-deal' scenario.""
Britain rejected Barnier's view.
""We don't recognise the suggestion that we've not engaged, we've been engaged in talks pretty consistently for many months now,"" a British source said. 
""The problem is the EU seems to define engagement as accepting large elements of their position rather than being engaged in discussions.""
The government said parliament would debate the contentious Internal Market Bill on Monday.
The bill will face opposition in both houses of parliament as many senior British politicians have expressed shock that London is explicitly planning to breach international law.
""I don't think this will get through the Lords, in its present form,"" said Norman Lamont, a Brexit supporting member of the House of Lords, the upper chamber.

""It is impossible to defend. They'll have to think again.""

GOMA/BRUSSELS, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Belgium's federal court said on Friday it would hand over a tooth, suspected to be the only remains of the murdered Congolese independence hero Patrice Lumumba, to his family, a move that could finally unlock the secret behind his death.
Lumumba, a firebrand political leader, became the Democratic Republic of Congo's first democratically-elected prime minister after independence from Belgium in 1960, but alarmed the West with overtures to Moscow at the height of the Cold War.
His government lasted just three months before he was overthrown and assassinated by firing squad, a killing for which the Belgian government took partial responsibility in 2002.
But the exact circumstances of his death have retained an element of mystery as his body was never found. His supporters and some historians accuse the CIA of having ordered his killing.
The tooth was reportedly taken from Lumumba's body by a Belgian policeman, Gerard Soete, who claimed in a BBC documentary to have dissolved much of Lumumba's body in acid, and burned the rest.
""The tooth is historically traced to Mr Lumumba by somebody who approached his body after his death,"" a spokesperson for Belgium's federal prosecutor told Reuters.
""This person is now deceased but had given the tooth to his daughter who gave it to the justice.""
A DNA test of the tooth would give Soete's account greater credibility. But the court has not approved a test because it would have destroyed the tooth, leaving nothing to give the family, the spokesman said.
In July, Lumumba's daughter Juliana sent a letter to the Belgian king asking for her father's remains to be returned. She wants to give the tooth a symbolic burial in Congo on Jan. 17, the anniversary of his death.
""We've been waiting for this moment 60 years to bury our father,"" Juliana said by telephone. 
Asked whether she believed the tooth belonged to her father, she said: ""maybe it's true, maybe it's not. Even if it's symbolic, we have to end this painful and dramatic episode."" 
""A lot of questions remain.""

791,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>","Free speech, gun rights on collision course in United States, some legal experts say","By Brad Brooks
(Reuters) - The robust American traditions of free speech and gun rights are clashing at anti-racism protests this year in a way rarely seen before in the United States, legal scholars and law enforcement leaders say. 
The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees citizens the right to free speech, and the Second the right to bear arms. But they are colliding in new ways, as ""open carry"" of guns to demonstrations becomes more common, officials at six police departments along with six legal scholars said.
Some worry that U.S. democracy will suffer if guns intimidate would-be protesters from voicing their opinion.
The gun culture and the exercise of free speech and assembly are ""all competing in the same space,"" said Timothy Zick, a law professor at the College of William & Mary who studies armed protests.
Mostly peaceful mass protests in several U.S. cities for racial equality following the May 25 death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis, Minnesota police are sometimes being met by people with weapons.
On Aug. 25, the issue came to a head when Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, used a rifle to kill demonstrators Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, during a protest against police brutality in Kenosha, Wisconsin. His lawyers say he acted in self-defense.
In Portland, Oregon, Michael Reinoehl, 48, a self-described supporter of the far-left movement Antifa, was charged in the fatal Aug. 29 shooting of Aaron Danielson, 39, who was in a caravan of President Donald Trump's supporters who clashed with anti-racism demonstrators. Reinoehl, wanted on a charge of murder, was shot dead last week in Olympia, Washington as police tried to arrest him.
Zick and Gregory Magarian, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, are part of a group of scholars who are researching how the First and Second Amendments began to collide following a landmark 2008 Supreme Court ruling https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-court/americans-have-right-to-guns-under-landmark-ruling-idUSWBT00928420080626. It struck down a Washington D.C. ban on private handguns, saying ""the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia,"" essentially giving every person the right to carry a gun.
The Supreme Court may need decades to establish the parameters of that right, legal experts said. But in the meantime the clash of rights is ""starting to produce a real body count,"" Magarian said. 
CENTURY OF FIRST AMENDMENT PRECEDENT
For a century the Supreme Court has refined what the First Amendment actually guarantees to Americans in its decisions. In a landmark 1919 ruling https://www.loc.gov/item/usrep249047, the country's highest court determined that speech that creates a ""clear and present danger"" to others is not protected, followed by a 1942 ruling https://www.loc.gov/item/usrep315568 that certain ""fighting"" words fall outside the protections of the First Amendment as well as others on what law enforcement owes public speakers. 
The 2008 gun ruling does not address a lot of real life situations, scholars say, including the specific question of whether carrying a gun in the open is a protected right. 
Pro-gun rights scholars and activists have long argued that the presence of weapons at protests does not intimidate free speech, but assures protection for voices that could be violently repressed if they were not armed. 
They say that armed volunteers protected non-violent Civil Rights era leaders and point out that Martin Luther King Jr. in 1956 applied for a concealed carry gun permit in Alabama, shortly after his house was bombed. His request was rejected.
Black Lives Matter protesters also deserve the right to bear arms for protection, argues Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor whose writings defend gun rights.
""Some may feel they can't count on the police, the police might retreat at any time and that they need to defend themselves,"" he said.
Zick and Magarian acknowledge it is difficult to measure exactly how free speech is being chilled by public gun carriers. Firearms at contentious public political rallies may ""inhibit people from coming out and speaking and participating and making their voices heard"" in the first place, Magarian said. 
There is no First Amendment right to attend a gun-free protest, the legal experts said. Only under narrow, specific circumstances can guns be prohibited, such as on the grounds of some government buildings.
POLICE CAUGHT IN MIDDLE 
Larry Satterwhite, the head of Homeland Security for the Houston Police Department whose job includes keeping local demonstrations safe, said that he's seeing far more armed people at protests now than at any time in his three-decade career. 
Demonstrators openly carrying guns is an unwelcome headache for police, he said, making it more difficult to ensure any given protest is safe. 
Houston city ordinances forbid protesters from carrying metal rods or pipes at demonstrations, Satterwhite said, ""yet you can bring a firearm. It seems a little counterintuitive to us as law enforcement officers.""
He said some people had never carried a gun before ""and suddenly they are carrying a gun to a volatile First Amendment activity where people are upset and highly emotional."" 
Officers repeatedly have to tell gun carriers at protests how to safely carry their weapon so that they are not inadvertently pointing it at officers, opposing protesters or their own group,"" Satterwhite said. 
Kevin Robinson, a former assistant police chief in Phoenix and a professor of criminal justice at Arizona State University, said he was bewildered by the new phenomenon of citizens showing up at demonstrations heavily armed. 
""Police are right in the middle,"" Robinson said. 
In Kenosha, Rittenhouse told a reporter for the Conservative website Daily Caller just before he shot and killed two people that it was his ""job"" to be armed in the streets. 
""So people are getting injured, and our job is to protect this business, and a part of my job is to also help people,"" Rittenhouse said. He said he had a rifle to protect himself and a medical kit if he saw someone hurt.
Other skirmishes between the First and Second Amendment have arisen in the 12 years since the 2008 Supreme Court ruling, such as fights over guns on college campuses. Some school officials argued https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-guns/texas-allows-guns-in-college-classrooms-under-new-law-idUSKCN10C2FS that the presence of weapons in classrooms inhibits academic freedom and truly free debate.
Until recently, open carrying was mostly done by hunters, far from population centers, said Allison Anderman, senior counsel at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence .
""People were not going around with handguns on their hips to make a point,"" she said.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The regional ruling party has won a landslide election victory in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, officials said on Friday, as a confrontation looms with national authorities who have branded the vote illegal.
The dominant Tigray’s People Liberation Front (TPLF) won 152 out of 190 seats in the polls for the regional legislature, electoral commission spokesman Abdel Guesh said.
Tigray pressed on with the vote this week, in a direct challenge to the federal government which has said it was postponing all regional and national elections until at least next year because of the pandemic.
The decisive win will strengthen the TPLF's hand as it confronts Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed who is struggling to hold together a fractious federation that stitches more than 80 ethnic groups into Africa's second-most populous nation. 
But the vote also saw off a more immediate threat to the country's unity - the TPLF won a decisive victory over a party calling for Tigray to split away from Ethiopia all together.
Abiy denounced the election but has not said how he will respond, beyond ruling out using force. The federal government supplies about half of the region's budget. 
Tigrayan leaders dominated the national coalition that took power in 1991 until Abiy's appointment in 2018. They have said Abiy is trying to illegally extend his term and some have accused him of persecuting Tigrayans.
Abiy has overseen sweeping democratic reforms since taking power, and won the Nobel Peace Prize for making peace with neighbouring Eritrea. But he has also faced increasing internal challenges from a slew of regional leaders.
""The (TPLF) has been the strongest critic of Abiy’s leadership, and this is likely to intensify after consolidating its power,"" said Will Davison, the Ethiopia analyst with the International Crisis Group think tank.
""However, the TPLF landslide means that Tigrayan secessionists did not make major gains, and it is now clearer than ever that the federal government has to deal with the TPLF if it wants to discuss issues stemming from its position that the election was unlawful.""

""Minimum conditions for credible, inclusive and transparent elections should be met for the deployment of (the mission),"" she said.
Venezuela's opposition has split on whether to participate in the elections, which will see voters elect delegates in the National Assembly. The current assembly head, Juan Guaido, is recognized by the EU as Venezuela's legitimate head-of-state, though Maduro retains control of the government and military.
Guaido's coalition of parties has vowed to boycott the election to avoid legitimizing an electoral process they deride as rigged. But in recent weeks another opposition bloc has emerged, under two-time former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, which says Guaido's stance risks making the opposition irrelevant and a strategy based on persuading foreign nations to impose sanctions on Maduro's government has failed.
On Thursday, Stalin Gonzalez, an opposition lawmaker backing Capriles, told Bloomberg that Capriles' faction would also boycott the election unless international observers agree to attend.
Asked for comment on the EU's new statement, Gonzalez told Reuters that ""the best option"" now would be to delay the election until conditions are met. ""We are fighting for conditions and international observation is fundamental to participate,"" he said.

Maduro has rejected calls to push back the vote and said on Tuesday they would take place on Dec 6 ""rain, thunder or lightning.""

794,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",Georgia judge rules out referendum on abolishing police department in Black jogger case,"ATLANTA (Reuters) - A Georgia Superior Court judge ruled on Friday that voters cannot decide to abolish the Glynn County Police Department over its handling of the murder of a Black jogger, an incident captured on a cellphone video that created a national outcry.
Liberty County Judge Charles Rose ruled that the authority to abolish a police department rests with local officials and was not subject to a public referendum.
The move to abolish the Glynn County Police Department was spurred by the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, by two white men, including a former police officer. The killing occurred in February but the suspects were charged only after state authorities become involved two months later.
Michael Browning, the chair of the Glynn County Board of Commissioners, said that it was the right decision.
""This was unconstitutional from the get-go,"" said Browning who pushed for the lawsuit to stop the referendum.
State Senator William Ligon, who started ballot initiative was not immediately available for comment. The state legislature approved of the referendum in June and Gov. Brian Kemp signed it into law in August, prompting the county commission's lawsuit.
A former Glynn County police officer, Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son Travis, 34, were charged with murder and aggravated assault in the Arbery case. 
Police say Gregory McMichael saw Arbery jogging through his neighborhood outside of Brunswick (NYSE:BC) and said he believed Arbery looked like a burglary suspect. The elder McMichael called his son and the two armed themselves and drove after Arbery.

The cell phone video appears to show Arbery was chased and shot with a shotgun. The Department of Justice is investigating the police department over the delay in bringing charges.

The group launched the attack in Kayanza province on Thursday night from the Kibira forest, the regional governor said, and fled to the same area after the attack.
""They arrived at a small centre ... killed six people including two kids studying in primary school II and V,"" Remy Cishahayo, army colonel and governor of Kayanza province, said on state-owned National Radio Television of Burundi.
The forest in the past has served as cover for the ruling CNDDFDD - The National Council for the Defence of Democracy, Forces for the Defence of Democracy party - during its rebellion.
Two people were wounded and were receiving treatment, while the attackers kidnapped one person, Cishahayo said. 
The centre attacked on Thursday is near the forest.
""People should stay calm and united ensuring security together "" Cishahayo said, adding the situation has returned to normalcy.  
In late August, gunmen attacked the district of Bugarama in the southern province of Rumonge, where at least 16 people died in shooting with security forces.
Red Tabara, a rebel group fighting Burundi's government and based in the Democratic Republic of Congo, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it killed police officers and the ruling party youth wing members, known as Imbonerakure.

Benjamin Clark, 18, has been charged with criminal damage and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Oct. 9.
The plinth of the statue bearing Churchill's name was sprayed in yellow paint with the words ""is a racist"" during a climate protest on Thursday.
In June, the statue was defaced during a fractious end to a mostly peaceful protest over the death of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis, prompting authorities to board it up for a period.
Floyd's death in police custody in May sparked protests about racial inequality across the United States and Europe and reignited a debate in Britain about monuments to those involved in the country's imperialist past.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at the time it was “absurd and deplorable” that Churchill's statue should have been in danger and he would resist any attempt to have it removed.

Voters will go to the polls to elect governors in 11 states and two territories.
Here is a look at five of the most prominent races and what they say about the partisan divide in state-level politics as the November U.S. election approaches.
MONTANA
Republican Greg Gianforte faces Democrat Mike Cooney in the race for Montana governor, which presently appears to be the closest of the upcoming gubernatorial races. Current Governor Steve Bullock, a Democrat, was unable to run for reelection due to term limits. He managed to remain fairly popular throughout his time in office, even though U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, won the state by a wide margin in the 2016 election.
Cooney, Bullock’s lieutenant governor, is a career public servant who has painted himself as Bullock’s successor. Gianforte is a U.S. congressman and businessman who has aligned himself with Trump and is perhaps best known for body slamming a reporter in 2017. A poll from mid-August showed the candidates within one point of each other.
NORTH CAROLINA
Incumbent Roy Cooper, a Democrat, is facing a challenge from Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest in North Carolina’s gubernatorial election. (North Carolina elects governors and their lieutenants independently of each other rather than as part of a single ticket.) Cooper, who narrowly won election in 2016 and has clashed with the state legislature, is leading his opponent by a wide margin, according to August polling data.
Democrats are hopeful that that Cooper's lead is an indication that North Carolina, a crucial swing state, will turn blue in the general election.
MISSOURI
Democrat Nicole Galloway is running against incumbent Mike Parson in Missouri’s race. Parson became governor in 2018 after the resignation of Governor Eric Greitens, and Galloway, currently the Missouri state auditor, has focused her campaign on his weak response to the coronavirus pandemic. That may not be enough to flip deep-red Missouri, which Trump won by more than 18 points. Recent poll results have varied but generally show Parson leading by five points or more.
NEW HAMPSHIRE
Polls show incumbent Governor Chris Sununu, a Republican, leading Democratic challenger Dan Feltes by more than 20 points. Feltes, a former legal aid attorney and current state senator, has sought to align Sununu with Trump in his campaign messaging. Trump narrowly lost New Hampshire in 2016, but Biden leads him by a wider margin in polls for the 2020 election. On the gubernatorial level, however, Sununu is well-liked and presently looks poised to win reelection.
VERMONT

Republican Governor Phil Scott and Lieutenant Governor David Zuckerman, a Vermont Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party member who is the Democratic nominee, are vying for Vermont governor in a race that does not at this stage appear to be close. Polls show Scott with a double-digit lead over his opponent. Scott, a moderate Republican, has criticized Donald Trump, and said this summer that he would not vote for him in the general election. He is popular in Vermont and has managed the pandemic well in the eyes of state voters, polls show.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States signaled on Friday that it will soon punish individual Belarusians with sanctions for election fraud and a brutal crackdown on protests as Washington urged Russia to tell Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko to step down.
Lukashenko denies rigging the country's Aug. 9 election, which official results said he won by a landslide. He also has refused to talk to the opposition, accusing them of trying to wreck the former Soviet republic squeezed between NATO and Russia.
Speaking to reporters during a conference call, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun said Washington is coordinating sanctions with the European Union but made clear neither would wait for the other to impose penalties.
""We are looking at targeted sanctions aimed at the individuals who are most responsible for ... the violence as well as the theft of the election,"" Biegun said, adding wider sanctions might be considered later but Washington was loath to do anything that would hurt the broader population.
A senior U.S. State Department official told Reuters on Sept. 1 Washington was weighing sanctions on seven Belarusians.
Biegun said Lukashenko, who has been in power for 26 years and is to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, is increasingly reliant on Moscow to maintain his rule, saying this could turn Belarusian public opinion against Russia.
""It risks turning the Belarusian people, who have no grievance with Russia, against Moscow,"" he said, adding that he hoped the Kremlin would voice concern about the violence against protesters in Belarus and the abductions of opposition figures.

""A free and fair election will allow Belarusian people to select who will be the next president of Belarus,"" he said. ""Ultimately we hope the message from Moscow to Minsk is that the ruler needs to give way to the will of his people.""

At talks in the eastern Polish city of Lublin, the Visegrad Four reiterated a call for a new election in Belarus, where protesters have been demanding the end of President Alexander Lukashenko's 26-year rule, and said the protests needed support.
Further sanctions against Belarusian officials are expected to be discussed at the Sept. 24-25 EU summit. 
Lukashenko denies rigging an Aug. 9 presidential election, which official results said he won by a landslide, and has cracked down hard on the protesters demanding his resignation.
""We want to propose an offer of economic cooperation for the future ... We want to propose visa-free travel for Belarusian citizens and this economic package for the future of Belarus,"" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told a news conference.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said a defense or military strategy could also be drafted regarding Belarus, but that discussion of this must wait until the EU summit. He did not elaborate on what this part of the plan would look like.
The grouping also discussed the region's relationship with China, which could be addressed further in a meeting with a U.S. official set up by Morawiecki for the group, as well as efforts to coordinate their response to the coronavirus crisis, the leaders said.

The grouping will create a coordinated response group to tackle the pandemic that will include Austria, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 11:07AM ET</span>",Lebanon faces hurdles to deliver cabinet on time,"By Tom Perry and Laila Bassam
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon faces an uphill struggle to deliver a new government next week as promised by its leaders to French President Emmanuel Macron, with new U.S. sanctions on Hezbollah allies complicating the process, Lebanese political sources said.
Any delay would deal a blow to a French initiative aimed at delivering Lebanon from the deepest crisis since its 1975-90 civil war by reforming the corruption-ridden state. France has warned that Lebanon could disappear unless it reforms.
Prime Minister-designate Moustapha Adib, nominated by Lebanon's fractious politicians under French pressure on Aug. 31, has been working to get a cabinet in place within two weeks to set about reforms laid out in a French roadmap.
The sources said a government could yet emerge in the next few days. The stakes could hardly be higher as Lebanon grapples with a financial meltdown and the aftermath of a catastrophic port explosion in Beirut on Aug. 4.
The already complex task has been made more so by U.S. sanctions on the senior aide to Shi'ite Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and a Christian politician, three political sources familiar with the process said.
Forming new Lebanese governments typically takes many months of bartering over how to share out portfolios among Christian and Muslim factions. 
The new U.S. sanctions were imposed on Berri advisor Ali Hassan Khalil, a former finance minister, and Christian politician Yusuf Finyanus, a former public works minister.
Washington says it shares French goals in demanding reform in Lebanon but differs with Paris over its policy on Hezbollah, a heavily armed Shi'ite group backed by Iran. Washington deems it a terrorist organisation while France views it an elected part of the system.
Some observers believed the U.S. sanctions and the threat of more to come could catalyse the government formation, arguing this will make Hezbollah allies such as President Michel Aoun's Christian Free Patriotic Movement more cooperative. 
But Berri, shocked by the sanctions on Khalil, responded by hardening his stance on naming the next finance minister, a post he has decided since Khalil first took the job in 2014, according to the three sources from different Lebanese factions.
""KNEE-JERK REACTION""
This makes it harder for Adib to achieve his goal of changing the leadership in that ministry and others where donors want to see reform, said one of the sources, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity due to political sensitivities. 
Several of these ministries have been controlled by the same factions for years and they will resist letting go if Berri gets to name the next finance minister.
""There is definitely a complicating factor from the U.S. sanctions,"" said the source from outside the Shi'ite camp.
""Hours if not minutes before the sanctions, all the indications were positive, that (the Shi'ite camp) were going to facilitate the government formation. Immediately after the sanctions, there was this knee-jerk reaction,"" the source said. 
The question now is whether Berri and Hezbollah will give ground, to support the French initiative and stop Lebanon slipping deeper into trouble. This should become clear in the next 48 hours, the source said.
A political source familiar with Hezbollah and Amal's thinking said that, while the finance ministry had been up for negotiation before the sanctions, Berri was now completely determined to name the minister.
A diplomat said on Thursday there had always been scepticism that a cabinet could be agreed in two weeks.
Political sources say Adib, who is seeking to form a cabinet of experts to deliver reform, has said he will step down if he is unable to proceed according to plan. 
The U.S. sanctions are not the only complication. 
Adib, who was nominated by former prime minister Saad al-Hariri, is drafting his cabinet line-up without consulting other parties, a Christian political source said.

""Shi'ites and Christians will find it unacceptable that their ministers are picked by the Sunni prime minister unilaterally,"" said a Christian political source. The source said the ministers should be picked jointly, the same way Adib was.

Under the new law, the government could inject 40 billion pesos in additional capital into state-owned banks so they can lend more to small businesses. 
The Philippines, which was among Asia's fastest growing economies before the pandemic, is in recession for the first time in 29 years after a lengthy lockdown shuttered businesses and sapped domestic demand.
As the country grapples with the highest number of COVID-19 infections in Southeast Asia, the law also allots 25.5 billion pesos to hire nurses and doctors, purchase protective gear, and build medical facilities.
A standby fund of 10 billion pesos could fund the government's purchase of COVID-19 vaccines. The Philippines is in talks with Russia, China, Australia and the United States for the potential supply of COVID-19 vaccines.
The stimulus package is ""crucial in our efforts to gradually re-open the economy,"" presidential spokesman Harry Roque said in a statement.
Partial restrictions remain in place in areas in and around the capital Manila, limiting the movement of people and capacity of businesses like restaurants and shopping malls. Schools remain shut and people are being urged to wear masks and practice social distancing.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday urged a peaceful way out of conflicts with China over the South China Sea and said international law must be followed, amid increased regional friction over military activities by Beijing and Washington. 
Duterte made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Chinese defence minister, Wei Fenghe, whose tour of four Southeast Asian countries coincides with some rhetorical sparring between the United States and China over the disputed waterway.
""We must always be guided by our commitments in international law. Any and all disputes must be resolved peacefully,"" Duterte said in a statement.
The Philippines, particularly its military, has a deep mistrust of China over what it sees as intrusions into its territory, bullying of its fishermen and denial of access to its energy resources. Vietnam and Malaysia have made similar complaints this year.
China maintains its activities are lawful, because they are in its waters.
Ties have improved somewhat due to Duterte's courting of and praise for the Chinese leadership. 
Wei, who has also visited Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei, had earlier met with Philippine Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, an outspoken critic of China's maritime conduct.
A defence ministry statement summarising the meeting said Lorenzana and Wei committed to resolve disputes amicably and advance mutual trust and interests.
However, that statement contrasted sharply from one issued earlier and later retracted, which said Lorenzana had told Wei that any activities infringing on Philippine maritime territory would be challenged by its navy.
Lorenzana said the Philippines would patrol its waters, according to the retracted statement, which referred to a 2016 arbitration ruling on the South China Sea that Lorenzana had told Wei would be adhered to ""without any possibility of compromise or change"".
The arbitration case is highly sensitive to China because the tribunal invalidated its claim of historic jurisdiction over nearly the entire South China Sea. 

The ministry gave no reason for revising the statement and did not respond to questions from Reuters. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's media authority said on Friday it would not automatically renew the licence of an opposition radio station, stoking fresh concerns about media freedom under Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government.
Klub Radio is one of a dwindling number of outlets critical of Orban, whose growing control of the media is among various issues that have prompted strong criticism from the European Union over the rule of law in Hungary.
The station, where opposition politicians and talk show guests often criticise government policies, can re-apply for the licence, due to expire in February 2021, but will have to compete for it, the Media Council said. If it loses, it will be able to broadcast online only.
Klub lost national licences several years ago. It is popular among left-wing Budapest intellectuals but reaches only about 200,000 people daily.
The Media Council, made up of government appointees, cited a string of regulatory offences by Klub radio in its current seven-year licence term. It did not specify the offences.
Klub radio disputed the regulatory offences, adding it would try to ""ensure that the last remaining radio channel reaching hundred of thousands of Hungarians with credible information is not silenced"".
Agnes Urban, head of the Mertek Media Monitor think-tank, said the move amounted to ""executing Klub Radio... The systematic eradication of media freedom in Hungary is underway.""
EU PRESSURE
Orban has long been under EU pressure to reverse reforms of the media, judiciary, education and non-governmental organisations that Brussels says undermine democracy. He rejects such criticism and has refused to change tack.
The main centre-right grouping in the European Parliament has suspended Orban's Fidesz party over its perceived backsliding on democracy.
Several media outlets including the largest independent print and online publications have been shut or taken over in recent years by government-friendly owners.
The main independent news outlet index.hu lost nearly its entire reporting staff when a pro-government operative took it over earlier this year.
The Vienna-based International Press Institute (IPI) said the EU must take action.
Its deputy director, Scott Griffen, said the EU celebrates ""press freedom and fair market competition... yet has so far failed to defend these values in Hungary"".

Critics of Orban have called for the disbursement of EU aid to be linked to respect for democratic norms, but EU leaders in July approved a massive coronavirus recovery aid package and a multi-annual budget with only watered-down language on such conditionality, a move hailed by Budapest as a victory.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Protests against police brutality in Colombia, which have rocked capital Bogota and satellite city Soacha for two nights, have left eleven dead and hundreds injured, the government said early on Friday.
Demonstrators have taken to the streets for two consecutive nights to protest the death on Wednesday of Javier Ordonez, 46. A widely-shared video filmed by Ordonez's friend showed the father of two being repeatedly shocked with a stun gun by police. He died later in a hospital.
Seven people aged between 17 and 27 years old died after being shot in Bogota during protests on Wednesday, according to the mayor's office, while the national government says three were killed the same night in Soacha. 
Family members of some of the Bogota victims told local media their loved ones had not been participating in the protests. 
Another woman was killed in Bogota on Thursday as protests continued. She was hit by a stolen public transport vehicle, local and national officials said.
More than 200 civilians and 194 police officers have been injured during the clashes, according to the national government. 
The video of Ordonez shows him pinned to the ground by police officers and subjected to successive electric shocks early on Wednesday as he begs, ""please, no more.""
Police say Ordonez was found drinking alcohol in the street with friends, in violation of coronavirus distancing rules. He was taken to a police station in western Bogota which has become a focal point of protests, and later died in hospital.
Two police officers have been suspended pending an investigation of the death of Ordonez. A further five have been suspended for alleged abuses during the protests. 

Ordonez's death could fuel renewed outrage against the police, who were widely criticized last year after a teenage protester was fatally injured by a riot squad projectile.

Inocente Orlando Montano Morales, 77, was also found responsible by the judges for the murders of the priests' housekeeper and her 15-year-old daughter, as well as a local Jesuit priest. The court could not convict him of these crimes because his extradition to Spain did not cover these cases.
The massacre was one of the most notorious acts of a decade-long civil war during which 75,000 people were killed and 8,000 went missing. 
The judges said they found Montano Morales guilty of five counts of ""murder of terrorist nature"", adding that the killings were committed by the state apparatus, making them what ""is commonly known as terrorism implemented by the state"".
They added that the total maximum prison term is 30 years.
Montano Morales has been in custody since 2011 when he was arrested in the United States on immigration fraud charges. He was deported to Spain in 2017.
The Spanish government has indicted 20 former Salvadoran army officers for the killings of the priests, their housekeeper and her daughter. One of the priests, Father Ignacio Ellacuria, was a prominent critic of the U.S.-backed right-wing government. 
The massacre occurred on Nov. 16, 1989, when a group of soldiers from the U.S.-trained Atlacatl Battalion entered the campus of the Central American University where Ellacuria was rector. 

Ellacuria had advocated a negotiated settlement to the military-led junta government's war against the left-wing Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). International revulsion at the murders of the priests helped to push through such a solution, with the war ending in 1992.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - A Georgia Superior Court judge could decide on Friday whether voters have the right to dissolve a county police department accused of mishandling of the killing of Black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in an incident caught on a cellphone video that went viral.
The video of the Feb. 23 death of Arbery, 25, in the coastal city of Brunswick (NYSE:BC) sparked outrage across the country, with civil rights activists saying it marked yet another example of the attack of an innocent Black man.
A former Glynn County police officer, Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son Travis, 34, were charged with murder and aggravated assault, but only after state authorities stepped in about two months after the shooting. 
The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the Glynn County police department to determine why charges were not brought earlier even though authorities had possession of the video.
Police say Gregory McMichael saw Arbery jogging through his neighborhood outside of Brunswick and said he believed Arbery looked like a burglary suspect. The elder McMichael called his son and the two armed themselves and drove after Arbery.
A third man, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, joined the chase in his pickup truck, police say, and shot a video of the incident on his phone. The clip appears to show the McMichaels confronting Arbery before the jogger was shot with a shotgun.
The move to abolish the police department was brought by State Senator William Ligon, who wants to hand over law enforcement in the county to the sheriff's office.
""We had proposed this before, after some police malfeasance back in 2019, but the Arbery case reinviogorated it, reaffirmed that this needs to go before the voters,"" Ligon said.
The Georgia General Assembly passed Ligon's Senate bill in June, along with a companion bill filed in the state House of Representatives. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed it into law in August, but a new state law put the decision to dissolve the police to a referendum vote. 
The Glynn County Board of Commissioners, however, filed a civil suit in late August to stop the Nov. 3 referendum, claiming it violates the state Constitution.
The judge is holding a hearing on Friday on the merits of the county commission's lawsuit, and he could issue a ruling on Friday

Michael Browning, chair of the county board, said, ""There's not much I can say on pending litigation. But we brought this on constitutional grounds. The power to form or dissolve the police rests solely with the commission.""

Geochanvre pitches the hemp masks as a way to reduce plastic waste during the coronavirus pandemic from single-use protective gear that environmentalists say will take centuries to decompose and is polluting the oceans.
""It's heresy not to ban polyethylene products, materials that are shipped to all corners of the world. Use local agricultural materials,"" Frédéric Roure, founding president of Geochanvre, told Reuters TV.
""This is a natural product and will go back into the soil.""
The mask's lining includes a corn blend for comfort and the elastic band is recyclable.
Bales of hemp fibre are passed through compressors and over rollers before emerging at the end of the line as hard-packed flat sheets, ready to be cut into shape and folded by hand.
Customers, mostly from Europe and Canada, have so far bought 1.5 million of the hemp masks since March.
Worldwide, an estimated 129 billion disposable face masks and 65 billion gloves are used every month, according to a study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.
Most single-use protective gear is made from plastics including polypropylene, polythene and vinyl.
Disposable plastic masks that end up in the oceans could take up to 450 years to decompose, according to campaign group Waste Free Oceans.

Biodegradable and compostable face masks, made from materials such as hemp or wood fibres, are being made or developed around the world.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russians vote in an array of local elections on Sunday that will test the ruling United Russia party's grip on power less than a month after the suspected poisoning of outspoken Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
The elections had been targeted by Navalny, who was urging his followers to vote tactically against the party that backs President Vladimir Putin before he fell gravely ill in what Germany and his allies say was an attempt to kill him.
Putin looks unassailable as president despite his approval rating slipping to two-decade lows earlier this year. 
But the results will be parsed for signs of protest voting spurred by frustrations over years of falling wages, the government's handling of the pandemic, and the ensuing economic fallout. 
The elections are seen by the Kremlin as a dry run for parliament elections next September and will elect 18 regional governors and a slew of local parliaments and city councillors. Early voting began on Friday. 
The rating of United Russia, which dominates politics across Russia's 11 time zones, dipped last month to 30.5%, its lowest since 2006, according to the state pollster VTsIOM, but it still remains much higher than that of Russia's other parliamentary parties. 
    Before he fell ill, Navalny was promoting a strategy he said aimed to disrupt a political system that often bars the Kremlin's staunchest foes from elections, while allowing softer candidates from the parliamentary parties to compete.
The strategy, which his allies are pressing ahead with, calls on supporters to back specific candidates - often from the Communist or LDPR nationalist parties - to hurt United Russia. 
The anti-corruption campaigner also has dozens of allies running in elections for the city councils of Novosibirsk and Tomsk in Siberia. He was flying back to Moscow after meeting them when he collapsed suddenly last month. 
These are the first elections since constitutional reforms were passed allowing Putin to run for two more six-year terms in the Kremlin, potentially extending his rule until 2036, instead of stepping down in 2024. 
Weighed down by a lockdown that inflicted economic pain on some households, Putin's approval rating dipped to 59% in April, a two-decade low, but then recovered to 66% last month, according to the Levada opinion pollster. 
There have been some signs of anti-Kremlin discontent in the regions. 

Mass rallies in the far eastern city of Khabarovsk show no sign of abating two months after they flared over the arrest of a popular local governor who defeated United Russia's candidate in an election upset in 2018.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 09:07AM ET</span>","Greece sets up tents for stranded migrants on Lesbos, locals oppose plans","By Lefteris Papadimas
LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - Greece began setting up tents on Friday for thousands of migrants left without shelter on the island of Lesbos after a fire destroyed Greece's biggest refugee camp three days ago.
With more than 12,000 former occupants of the notoriously overcrowded Moria camp now camping out in fields and along roadsides without food or water and threatened by a possible spread of coronavirus infections, the need for a solution has become increasingly urgent.
But the Greek government has been forced to tread warily due to growing anger among residents of an island whose location a few miles (km) off the Turkish coast has kept them on the frontline of Europe's migrant crisis for years.
""Moria is a monstrosity,"" Dimitris Koursoubas, a senior official responsible for migration in the northern Aegean islands, told Reuters, saying the fire which destroyed the camp presented a ""tragic opportunity"" to find a new solution.
""We want all the migrants out, for national reasons. Moria is over,"" he said.
Hoping to avoid a repeat of protests seen earlier this year, island authorities have not said where the shelters are being set up but helicopters with tents and other materials could be seen landing a few miles from the main port of Mytilene.
Greek officials say they believe the fire in the Moria camp was deliberately lit by migrants reacting to quarantine measures after COVID-19 was detected in the camp last week.
But the emergency has once again highlighted Europe's patchy response to a multi-year crisis that has seen more than a million migrants reach its shores, often on board flimsy vessels and fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East and beyond.
""The clock has run out on how long Europe can be without a migration policy. Now is the time to change this,"" Margaritis Schinas, the European commissioner responsible for migration and asylum policy, said at a press conference in Brussels.
Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Italy where most migrant boats arrive, have long demanded that other EU states take in more asylum seekers but Hungary and Poland, among others, have refused to share the burden.
""SLEEPING AMONG THE GRAVES""
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, speaking alongide Schinas, said France and Germany had agreed to take in most of some 400 minors who have been moved from Lesbos to the Greek mainland.
But there has been no wider agreement on resettlement and Greek authorities have refused any mass transfers off Lesbos.
""Life meets death here,"" said Eftychia Sougioultzi, a 64 year-old local woman, visiting a cemetery where her daughter is buried. ""Yesterday I saw children sobbing, sleeping among the graves.""
For the migrants, who are mostly from Syria and Afghanistan, the outlook is bleak.
""Moria finished,"" said Zohra, a 25-year-old Afghan woman. ""We are two days on the road, no water, no food, very cold at night.""
The World Health Organisation said it was sending two emergency medical teams. Officials also said 200,000 rapid COVID-19 tests had been brought to the island to handle a possible upsurge in cases from the camp, which was placed under quarantine last week after a 40-year-old man tested positive.

In the chaos following Wednesday's fire, authorities have lost track of at least 35 people who had tested positive.

817,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",Turkish court sentences pro-Kurdish MP to jail on terrorism charges,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court sentenced a parliamentarian from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) to 10 years in jail on Friday for membership of a terrorist organisation, court documents showed.
Remziye Tosun, a member of parliament representing the province of Diyarbakir in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey, will remain free pending the appeals process, according to the documents.
Tosun was accused of treating wounded members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group during clashes in Diyarbakir's Sur district in 2016, her lawyer told Reuters.
""There is no evidence that supports the verdict. It is based on statements that were taken by force from individuals who were there during that period,"" said Muharrem Sahin.
He added that Tosun had lived in the area and did not have expertise to treat people.
Ankara accuses the HDP of ties to the PKK, which has fought against the state in the southeast since 1984 and is deemed a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union. The HDP, which is the third largest party in parliament with 56 deputies, denies such links.
A ceasefire between Ankara and the militant group ended in the summer of 2015, leading to some of the most violent clashes in years, including in the Sur district.
The opposition has accused President Tayyip Erdogan and his AK Party of seeking to quash dissent by jailing opposition members and critics since a 2016 failed coup. The government has said its actions are justified by threats which Turkey faces.
Two other lawmakers from the HDP and one from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) were jailed in June, after parliament stripped them of their status as deputies due convictions against them.
Eleven HDP deputies had their status removed before a parliamentary election in 2018.

The army said on Sept. 2 it had discovered a stockpile close to the port of 4.35 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, the highly explosive chemical blamed for the huge Aug. 4 blast that killed about 190 people and ruined a swathe of Beirut.
The Aug. 4 blast was caused by a far larger quantity of the chemical, about 2,750 tonnes, which officials said had been stored for about six years at the port in unsafe conditions.
Critics said the lack of proper care and attention in storing such highly explosive material revealed the depth of dysfunction in the way Lebanon has been governed. The country is grappling with an economic crisis under a mountain of debt. 
After meeting senior army officers overseeing work at the devastated port, President Michel Aoun said in a statement the 4.35 tonnes of ammonium nitrate found near a port entrance had been stored since 2005. He said it had been safely destroyed.
He also said the army inspected 143 containers at the port that he said were found to hold other flammable material.
On Thursday, warehouses at the port, some still holding stored goods despite blast damage, erupted into a huge fire. A source said the blaze was caused by welding during repairs, as stray sparks set light to flammable contents.
Thursday's blaze, barely a month after the huge explosion, sent a cloud of acrid smoke over the capital and generated panic in the city, still traumatized by the blast that smashed buildings in the area and shattered windows all over Beirut.

As well as killing about 190, the Aug. 4 explosion injured 6,000. The president's statement said nine people were still listed as missing since the blast.

819,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 08:33AM ET</span>",Special Report: Big Pharma wages stealth war on drug price watchdog,"By Caroline Humer
(Reuters) - As evidence grew this spring that the drug remdesivir was helping COVID-19 patients, some Wall Street investors bet on analysts’ estimates that its maker,  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD), could charge up to $10,000 for the treatment.
Then a small but increasingly influential drug-pricing research organization, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), said the treatment only justified a price between $2,800 and $5,000. Shortly after, Gilead announced it would charge about $3,100 for a five-day treatment and $5,700 for ten days - in line with the ICER recommendation.
The episode illustrates the growing power of the Boston-based nonprofit to hold down U.S. drug prices. Over the past five years, ICER has pressured drugmakers to lower the cost of nearly 100 drugs. It aims to play a similar role with emerging COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. Health insurers increasingly use ICER's fair-value analyses to limit access to expensive drugs or to negotiate steeper discounts with drugmakers. 
(For a graphic on drugs ICER has rated overpriced, click https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-DRUGPRICING-LOBBYING/0100B5JY41G/index.html)
The industry has moved aggressively to combat the threat to its profits in two ways: With open criticism of ICER's formula and with a stealthier campaign to undermine its credibility through proxies, including veterans' groups and organizations that claim to advocate for patients but have ties to the pharmaceutical industry, Reuters found in a review of industry connections and funding among groups targeting ICER. 
Two such groups – the Partnership to Improve Patient Care (PIPC) and Value our Health – are led by employees of Thorn Run Partners, a Washington-based lobbying and public relations firm that counts nearly a dozen drugmakers as clients. PIPC denied it is part of a larger industry-financed proxy campaign to undermine ICER's impact. Thorn Run declined to comment, and Value Our Health did not respond to inquiries.
As remdesivir gained momentum, PIPC complained to ICER in a June letter that its methodology, which examines how a drug improves patient quality of life, was unfair for COVID-19 drugs. It also held a webinar for patients criticizing ICER’s methods. 
The group’s chairman, former U.S. Democratic Representative Tony Coelho, argued in the letter that ICER’s methods yield a flawed value assessment for COVID-19 drugs that could lead insurers or government programs to limit coverage to the elderly and people with disabilities because ICER’s formula attributes a lower value to their medicines than those for healthier patients. In a statement to Reuters, Coelho attacked ICER’s formula as a flawed “one-size-fits-all assessment.” 
Gilead also pushed ICER for a higher price during its remdesivir review. The firm told Reuters that ICER’s assessment failed to consider savings from shorter hospital stays and underestimated how much insurers or the government would be willing to pay.
Remdesivir is the only COVID-19 treatment ICER has assessed so far. Steven Pearson, a Harvard academic who started ICER, said it will likely review more coronavirus treatments if they make it to market, including potentially those being developed by Regeneron and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co that use antibodies to generate an immune response. The two companies declined to comment.
ICER’s assessments are not used to deny care to patients based on their health, Pearson said. Rather, the formula helps insurers or government programs choose the most cost-effective treatment for a specific condition, based on its price and benefit in providing a better quality of life. Pearson pointed out that the formula has long been used in the health systems of countries including England, Canada, the Netherlands and Sweden.
“We don’t think of them as hotbeds of discrimination against sick people,” he said, “and neither are we.”
(Graphic: Overpriced drugs? - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-DRUGPRICING-LOBBYING/0100B5JY41G/index.html)
PHONY GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN
The industry has followed the same playbook before: soliciting criticism from outside groups - some of which it finances or staffs - to create the impression of a broad-based patient uprising against ICER’s pricing assessments rather than an industry push to protect profits.
Last year, ICER invited input as it revamped its assessment methods. Two of more than 50 comment letters came from six California veterans’ groups, who blasted an ICER contract with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), saying its formula denies veterans care and “inherently discriminates” against people with disabilities.
But no one from the veterans’ groups wrote the complaints. Officials from the organizations told Reuters they lent their names to letters that were composed instead by Peter Conaty, the pharmaceutical industry’s go-to lobbyist in California. A half dozen health policy specialists told Reuters that the veterans’ complaints look like part of an “astroturf” campaign – a phony grassroots movement backed by corporate interests. Conaty did not respond to requests for comment.
Such under-the-radar PR efforts underscore the industry’s determination to protect its pricing power in an era when expensive new drug therapies are increasingly under fire for their role in soaring U.S. healthcare costs. The battle for influence over drug prices could have far-reaching effects on consumers, insurers, employers and the government, industry and policy experts said.
Matt Eyles, president of insurance lobby America’s Health Insurance Plans, said ICER plays a key role in holding down “out of control” drug prices. “Big Pharma is doing everything in its power - including pushing other groups to levy false claims of analytical bias and discrimination - to undermine ICER’s long history of independence and its commitment to bringing value into drug pricing.”
The VA, which covers health care for more than 9 million people - veterans and their family members - started using ICER drug-value assessments in 2017 to negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical firms. VA spokeswoman Ndidi Mojay said the agency uses ICER’s research for those negotiations but not to limit treatments. The VA strives to provide veterans the best possible care and taxpayers the best value, Mojay said. 
“ICER helps the department do just that,” she said.
PRICING QUALITY OF LIFE
ICER uses a decades-old formula called the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – the cost of one year of good health for one patient – to estimate fair value. European nations have long used QALY to guide their drug coverage, and ICER defends it as the gold standard.
The organization is filling a void left by the federal government, which does not negotiate drug prices for Medicare, the healthcare program for disabled and older Americans, and Medicaid, which serves the poor. Pharmaceutical industry representatives say they fear that ICER is slowly taking over that function for the government and insurers. Congress banned the Medicare program from using QALY to evaluate drug prices in the 2010 Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare - after the industry lobbied for such a provision.
The industry’s largest U.S. trade group - the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA - has publicly criticized ICER’s formula as undervaluing drugs, arguing it fails to consider certain patient benefits, such as the ability to return to work. Randy Burkholder, one of PhRMA’s top lobbyists, called the method “fundamentally and intractably” flawed in an interview. The National Pharmaceutical Council, an industry-financed research group, has regularly criticized ICER in the media, arguing drugmakers will invest less in future treatments if ICER’s recommendations limit prices.
Groups including PIPC are parroting the industry arguments while claiming to represent patients - without disclosing their industry ties, according to a Reuters review of the groups' press releases, blogs, webcasts and letters. Value our Health - which has been represented by Shea McCarthy, a Thorn Run public relations partner and lobbyist - is one of a half dozen organizations who has regularly flooded health and policy journalists with emails lambasting ICER.
Sara van Geertruyden, PIPC’s executive director, is also a Thorn Run public relations partner. She said the group advocates for patients and denied that PIPC is a proxy for pharmaceutical-industry interests or that it has concealed its industry ties. She blasted ICER as a “payer-focused” organization delivering skewed assessments that allow insurers to deny patients access to drugs. “Is it any surprise patients would be concerned?” she asked.
Nicole Longo, spokeswoman for the PhRMA trade group, did not answer detailed questions from Reuters about whether it was directing a campaign through proxies to undermine ICER. Longo provided PhRMA’s comments to ICER on its remdesivir pricing assessment, which called its methodology biased and “designed to devalue remdesivir and other COVID-19 treatments.”
The National Pharmaceutical Council’s Interim Chief Executive Officer Robert DuBois said that it does not advocate or lobby for the drug industry. ICER’s methodology is an inaccurate measure that does not fully account for how a drug helps patients or society, he said.
In January, after ICER called new sickle cell treatments too pricey in a draft report, Value our Health, PIPC and sickle-cell patient groups pushed patients and caregivers to report disease-related costs to ICER to “help ICER put a price tag” on sickle-cell expenses. ICER postponed the review process due to COVID-19 and has not issued a final report.
Last fall, Reuters reported that CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), one of the biggest U.S. pharmacy benefit managers, decided to scale back a new program for employers that would exclude coverage of drugs that ICER says are not cost effective. The move followed a pressure campaign by PIPC against CVS. At the time, CVS cited fierce criticism from patient groups as the reason for backtracking. CVS Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan said, in a statement to Reuters, that CVS still uses ICER’s analyses in a drug-coverage plan for its own employees and a small number of other clients.
The PhRMA Foundation - the trade group’s nonprofit public health advocacy arm - has spent $3 million on research into alternative methods of determining a drug’s value, according to foundation announcements. Foundation President Eileen Cannon said that the foundation consults with PhRMA, the industry group, but makes decisions on academic grants independently.
ICER responds to industry accusations of discrimination by arguing that its review process is flexible and considers additional measures besides QALY when warranted. As an example, ICER points to its verdict on Luxturna, an $850,000-per-patient gene therapy from Spark Therapeutics Inc, now part of Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF). Luxturna improves the sight of children who have a rare genetic disease causing blindness. Though the QALY numbers did not support that price, ICER determined that Luxturna was cost-effective because it reduced the burden on the children's’ caregivers.
PhRMA director of policy Lauren Neves the Luxturna example was an exception to ICER’s typical practice.
DRIVING DOWN DRUG PRICES, PROFITS
ICER started focusing on drug prices in 2015 and has since evaluated nearly 100 treatments, taking on those that insurers worry will raise overall health-care costs. ICER has considered only a handful of those therapies to be cost-effective at full list price, and only a third to be fairly priced after considering drugmaker discounts, according to data that ICER provided to Reuters.
Big Pharma had its first big ICER problem in 2015 when the group recommended to health insurers that two new drugs to treat high cholesterol should cost about one-third of the manufacturers’ prices. The analysis prompted insurers to sharply limit use of the treatments and eventually forced drugmakers  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) and  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) SA to slash prices. The companies declined to comment.
Today, the largest U.S. health insurers, such as  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) and CVS, use ICER findings to negotiate discounts. New York’s Medicaid program has used ICER to push drug companies to lower prices, and other states are considering it.
In July, the New York state Medicaid board voted to demand that Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) sell its spinal muscular atrophy drug to the state at the ICER-prescribed price of about $77,000 for a typical year of treatments - an 80% discount off Biogen’s list price.
Biogen spokeswoman Anna Robinson said that the firm disagreed with the steep discount and hoped to work with New York to ensure patients get the treatment.
PANDEMIC RAISES THE STAKES
With fewer than 30 employees and a budget of about $6 million in 2018, ICER is bankrolled mostly by Houston billionaire John Arnold, the former Enron energy trader and hedge fund owner who has taken on drug-pricing as one of many philanthropic efforts. ICER also takes money from companies on both sides of the drug-pricing debate - insurers and pharma - but says that they together provide only about 20% of its revenue.
Arnold told Reuters in an interview that he finances ICER because past efforts to foster independent drug-price analysis have been co-opted by the pharmaceutical industry and tainted by its money.
“The status quo works very well in the industry, so it is important for them to label any proposed reform as something radical and something that won’t work,” he said. “There is not much debate about whether the system we have to price pharmaceutical drugs is broken.” 
ICER’s Pearson said the coronavirus pandemic has raised the importance of the organization’s work as the pricing of vaccines and treatments will impact millions of Americans amid a faltering economy.

“There is a heightened public awareness and sensitivity to the risk of high prices being unfair,” he said.

The Aug. 18 coup that toppled Ibrahim Boubacar Keita led to swift economic sanctions by ECOWAS, which fears it could set a dangerous precedent in the region and undermine the fight against Islamist militants across West Africa's Sahel region.
The experts' recommendations emerged on the second day of talks on a transition. ECOWAS, which stands for the Economic Community of West African States, has given the ruling junta until Tuesday to name a transitional president and prime minister.
In an eight-page ""charter of the transition"" the experts wrote that a transitional period of 24 months was needed ""in light of the complexity, the gravity and the structural depth of the Malian crisis"".
They recommended that the ruling junta, the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP), choose the interim president and vice president and propose the prime minister, who would be appointed by the interim president.
The recommendations have not yet been formally approved by the representatives of the CNSP, political leaders and civil society groups taking part in the talks, which are due to end on Saturday.
Some Malian political leaders have insisted, along with ECOWAS, that the interim president is a civilian, but the document said the person can be a soldier or civilian.
The candidate must be between the ages of 35 and 75 and would not be eligible to stand for election at the end of the transition, it said.
Ghana will host a mini-summit of ECOWAS leaders next Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Ghana's foreign ministry said. It has not said what it will do if its demands are not met by then.

Dozens of people were detained this week as protesters took to the streets chanting her name and holding up placards, some reading ""Viva Maria"". Her face was superimposed on the image of a Soviet World War Two poster and projected onto the side of a building in Minsk. 
""Belarusian cops, sitting by the fire in the evening, frighten each other with stories about Maria Kolesnikova,"" went one of several jokes doing the rounds online about her defiance. 
The 38-year-old was last seen in public on Monday being snatched off the street of Minsk into a van by masked men. In a statement made through her lawyer, Kolesnikova says she was later driven to the Ukrainian border by security officers in the middle of the night, and threatened with expulsion ""alive or in bits"".
According to two allies who were with her, she prevented her expulsion by tearing her passport into small pieces and throwing it out of the car window.
She is now detained in the capital, facing a potential long prison term over accusations of trying to seize power illegally.
Her team says Kolesnikova has bruises on her body, but ""feels as normal as possible.""
""She is cheerful, her cellmates support her. She asks to be given light and bright clothes to dilute the grey shades of the cell,"" they said in a statement on Thursday.
Fellow activist Ivan Kravtsov, who was driven to the border with Kolesnikova and travelled to Kyiv after his expulsion, said she had shown similar steel a few days earlier when confronting riot police, demanding they ensure the safety of the protesters.
""There were these frightening people with shields, in riot gear, it looked pretty frightening. But she said, 'I'm not in the least bit scared. I feel sorry for these people,'"" Kravtsov told Reuters by phone. 
""During all these months, we were periodically scared and Maria was, of course, scared. But obviously she can handle it.""
BECOMING A LEADER
Kolesnikova, a flautist who spent 12 years in Germany, has described her own rise to the frontlines of her country's politics as unlikely and unexpected.
""I understand that I am becoming a leader, but this process, this transformation is just beginning with me. I cannot say that I was ready for this,"" she said last week.
She was one of three women, all political novices, who joined forces to front the campaign against Lukashenko ahead of the Aug. 9 presidential election, after higher-profile male candidates were barred from standing.
The other two, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya and Veronika Tsepkalo, both came forward in place of their better-known husbands. Kolesnikova had worked on the campaign of Viktor Babariko, a banker who was jailed. The women agreed to unite behind Tsikhanouskaya as a consensus candidate.
An image of the three -- Tsikhanouskaya clenching her fist, Kolesnikova making a heart sign and Tsepkalo making a 'V' for victory -- quickly spread. In the run-up to the vote, they drew crowds of tens of thousands, taking the authorities by surprise.
In her initial political speech after the arrest of Babariko, Kolesnikova appeared hesitant and lost her place in the text. But she quickly grew into a fiery public speaker.
While on the campaign trail, she told Reuters she sometimes wore dark glasses to mask her tears when she felt overwhelmed by support.

After the election, Tsikhanouskaya, Tsepkalo and other opposition figures fled into exile. But Kolesnikova vowed to stay, quipping that she would rather eat her passport than be forced across the border.

Thursday's fire, which officials said was sparked by welding during repair work after last month's explosion, covered several districts of Beirut in a huge cloud of black, acrid smoke, causing panic in a city still on edge after the blast.
The Aug. 4 port blast exacerbated challenges in a nation that is grappling with a deep economic crisis and facing the biggest threat to its stability since a 1975-1990 civil war.
""Yesterday, just seeing this smoke made me feel there is no hope,"" said Karim Massoud, 33, speaking in a residential area near the blaze that was also hit hard by the explosion.
The civil defence said in a statement that firefighters had extinguished the flames on Friday morning after working through the night, and were cooling the site to prevent it reigniting.
Lebanese President Michel Aoun said at a meeting of the Supreme Defence Council on Thursday night that the fire could have been caused by sabotage, technical error or negligence. He called for a swift investigation.
Many Lebanese are frustrated that they have yet to be told about any initial findings from a probe into last month's explosion that killed about 190 people and injured 6,000.

The government resigned after the port blast, and Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib is racing to form a new cabinet by early next week to meet a two-week deadline agreed under French pressure. Forming a government in Lebanon usually takes months.

Both countries have so far been spared the major outbreaks seen elsewhere in Asia, but Myanmar's quadrupling of its cases to 2,265 in less than a month has put Thailand on the alert.
Footage broadcast by local television showed border town residents and scores of Myanmar migrant workers queuing under tents to give swab samples at mobile testing trucks. 
Military personnel laid out reams of coiled razor wire through forest along the porous frontier to deter illegal entry into Thailand, where several million Myanmar nationals work. 
Thailand is determined to keep the virus at bay and has sealed off the country to all but returning Thai nationals and approved foreigners, who must all undergo quarantine. 
The vast majority of Thailand's 3,461 cases have long recovered and until last week, it had been more than three months without a domestic case.

Myanmar has a stay-at-home order in place and has closed schools, suspended domestic flights and barred non-essential travel in response to the resurgence.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - More than half the arrests this year under a tough national security law in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh have involved suspects in cases of cow slaughter, data showed.
The northern state has used the National Security Act (NSA), which allows for those deemed a threat to national security to be detained without charge for up to a year, almost 140 times in the first eight months of the year. 
""The NSA has been invoked in 139 cases across Uttar Pradesh, of which 76 have been against the slaughter of cows,"" Awanish Awasthi, a top state official, said in a statement. 
The figure, for the year to August 18, was first reported by the Indian Express newspaper on Friday. 
The cow is considered sacred by India's Hindu-majority population, and most states, including Uttar Pradesh, have laws against slaughter of the animals. 
Vigilante attacks on those accused of killing the animal for meat, often people belonging to the tiny Muslim minority, are common. 
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has repeatedly urged use of the NSA to combat law and order issues in the state of more than 200 million people.
The Hindu monk is a high-profile figure in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. 
The NSA, which Indian rights activists have described as draconian, is also frequently used in the contested region of Kashmir to detain people suspected of separatist activity. 

""In many cases the charges of NSA are dropped because the authorities fail to prove it in court,"" said Irfan Ghazi, a lawyer based in the state's city of Aligarh, who has defended clients held under the act.

Prosecutors had said the Swiss-Italian dual citizen, whose name has not been released publicly, travelled to IS-controlled areas of Syria in 2013, where he joined an IS-aligned combat unit. 
Upon returning to Switzerland, the now 34-year-old defendant capitalised on his reputation as a warrior to motivate several people to join IS, prosecutors said, calling him ""a Salafist guiding figure in Switzerland"" who liaised with several convicted IS recruiters from Europe.
He had pleaded not guilty to charges of supporting and participating in a criminal organization and violating a ban on representations of acts of violence but was convicted after a trial.
Winterthur is the suburb of Zurich where he lived and ran a training gym.
Several media outlets said the Federal Criminal Court also fined a second defendant with Swiss-Macedonian dual citizenship who was charged with attempting to travel to IS territory to join the organisation and with recruiting one individual for IS.
The court did not respond to an email seeking confirmation of the verdicts.
Broadcaster SRF said the main suspect had told the court he had briefly embraced jihadist ideology but had since had a change of heart and regretted the episode. He said he had travelled to Syria to provide humanitarian assistance.
Switzerland has not experienced deadly militant attacks like those that have hit neighbouring countries such as Germany and France, but has identified hundreds of residents deemed a threat and cases of jihadi travellers who have left Switzerland for war zones.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hackers linked to Russia, China, and Iran are trying to spy on people tied to both U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) said on Thursday.
The report came as Reuters revealed one of Biden's main campaign advisory firms had been warned by the software giant that it was in the crosshairs of the same Russian hackers who intervened in the 2016 U.S. election.
The Microsoft statement highlights how advisers to both presidential campaigns are at risk from digital spies around the globe, as the two candidates face off on Nov. 3 in one of the most consequential U.S. presidential elections in decades. 
The announcement by Microsoft's vice president for customer security, Tom Burt, said the group accused of breaching Hillary Clinton's campaign emails in 2016 - a Russian military intelligence-linked unit widely known as Fancy Bear - had spent the past year trying to break into accounts belonging to political consultants serving both Republicans and Democrats as well as advocacy organizations and think tanks.
Burt also said Chinese hackers had gone after people ""closely associated with U.S. presidential campaigns and candidates"" - including an unnamed Biden ally who was targeted through a personal email address and ""at least one prominent individual formerly associated with the Trump Administration.""
He added that Iranian hackers - which Microsoft has already called out publicly for attempts to spy on a U.S. political campaign that Reuters identified https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-cyber-security-iran-trump-exclusive/exclusive-trump-campaign-targeted-by-iran-linked-hackers-sources-idUKKBN1WJ2AD?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&rpc=69 as being Trump's - had since tried to log into accounts belonging to Trump administration officials and members of the Republican president's campaign staff.
Microsoft's announcement was planned before Reuters broke the news that Fancy Bear was suspected of targeting Washington-based SKDKnickerbocker, a campaign strategy and communications firm working with Biden and other prominent Democrats. 
Burt did not name any of the political consultants involved and Microsoft declined to comment on whether SKDK was among the consultants it had identified as targets. 
SKDK has declined comment. 
Burt said the Chinese effort to compromise the Biden ally and the Iranian spying against the Trump campaign were unsuccessful, but his blog post provided no detail on the hacking campaign attributed to Russia or the effort to compromise the well-known former Trump associate.
Speaking generally, he said that foreign hacking was intensifying as the vote drew nearer.
""The activity we are announcing today makes clear that foreign activity groups have stepped up their efforts targeting the 2020 election as had been anticipated,"" Burt said.
The Department of Homeland Security's top cyber official, Christopher Krebs, said Microsoft's warning was consistent with earlier statements issued by the intelligence community about Russian, Chinese, and Iranian spying on election-related targets.
""It is important to highlight that none are involved in maintaining or operating voting infrastructure and there was no identified impact on election systems,"" Krebs said. 
The Biden and Trump campaigns both said they were aware of the targeting and weren't surprised by it.
Russian Embassy Press Secretary Nikolay Lakhonin pushed back on the allegations, saying Americans had been discussing ""so-called 'interference'"" for years without presenting what he described as ""factual evidence."" Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran’s U.N. mission in New York, said it was ""preposterous to even think that Iran would conduct hacking.""
China's foreign affair ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that China has no interest in the U.S. election and has never interfered in it.
The U.S. was an ""empire of hackers,"" he said, at a daily news briefing in Beijing on Friday. 
State-backed hackers going after politicians in an election year is not unusual.
""Parties and campaigns are good sources of intelligence on future policy,"" said John Hultquist, an analyst at cybersecurity company FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE)'s Mandiant unit. 

But he said he was particularly concerned by the news that Fancy Bear was active, saying the group history of leaking data it hacked ""raises the prospect of follow-on information operations or other devastating activity.""

Previously, Finland has barred arrivals from countries with more than 8-10 cases of coronavirus infection per 100,000 people, a threshold which excluded travellers from many European countries. The exclusion of Swedes was particularly disruptive, as the neighbours are close allies.
From Sept 19, the threshold for countries to gain unrestricted entry will rise to 25 cases per 100,000.

832,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Abe plan for land-attack counterpunch could mark major military shift for Japan,"By Tim Kelly and Kiyoshi Takenaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - Months before he announced his resignation, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe set in motion a policy change that could for the first time allow Japan's military to plan for strikes on land targets in China and other parts of Asia.
Japan's Self Defence Forces are geared toward stopping attackers in the air and the sea. The policy change would direct the military to create a doctrine for targeting enemy sites on land - a mission that would require the purchase of long-range weapons such as cruise missiles.
If adopted by the next government, the policy would mark one of the most significant shifts in Japan's military stance since the end of World War Two. It reflects Abe's longstanding push for a more robust military and Tokyo's deepening concern about Chinese influence in the region. 
The Japanese government is worried by China's increased military activity around disputed East China Sea islets.
""The main reason for our action is China. We haven't really emphasised that too much, but the security choices we make are because of China,"" Masahisa Sato, a lawmaker from Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party who has served as a deputy defence minister and a deputy foreign minister, said in an interview.
Japan renounced its right to wage war after World War Two, making the issue of striking targets on land - which would entail attacks on foreign soil - contentious for its Asian neighbours, particularly China. 
Abe said last month he was stepping down because of worsening health. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, who is seen as less hawkish than Abe but is closely aligned with him, is expected to win the race to replace him as party leader and become premier.
GOVERNMENT POLICY
Abe instructed senior defence policymakers in June to come up with LDP proposals for the military that included a land-attack, or strike, doctrine. 
That proposal will become government policy if it is included in a revised national defence strategy, which appears likely, according to two insiders, including LDP acting Secretary General Tomomi Inada. 
""I don't think there is much opposition to it in the LDP,"" Inada told Reuters. ""That direction doesn't change even with a new prime minister.""
The military can already use long-range missiles to strike ships. It considers such plans justified because it needs to be able to destroy weapons threatening Japan. The land-attack proposal is framed using the same reasoning, according to former defence minister Itsunori Onodera.
Therefore, proponents say, Japan's laws will not need to change. During his eight years in office, Abe pushed for but failed to achieve his goal of revising the post-war constitution's pacifist Article 9.
Japan's National Security Council, which Abe leads and includes key cabinet officials, including Suga, convened on Friday and said in a statement it would formulate a new national security strategy by the end of the year.
""There is a question of whether intercepting attacks alone is sufficient to protect peace, lives and people's livelihoods,"" it said in the statement.
U.S.-made BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles would be an option for land-attack weapons, said Katsutoshi Kawano, who until last year was Japan's most senior military officer, the Chairman of Self Defense Forces Chief of Staffs.
Tomahawks can hit targets 2,500 kilometres (1,553 miles) away. That would put most of China and much of the Russian Far East within range.
""Japan could probably have strike capability within five years,"" Kawano said. ""A full strike package including targeting satellites and electronic warfare components would, however, be far more expensive and take more than 10 years to acquire.""
In the meantime, Japan would have to rely on the United States for intelligence and surveillance. 
POLITICS
To move the proposal forward, the next government will need to complete a midterm procurement plan as well as the revised defence strategy promised by the NSC by the end of December, before the defence ministry submits its annual budget request. 
That could meet resistance from the LDP's coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed Komeito, which worries such a move would antagonise China and threaten Japan's war-renouncing constitution. 
""It could spark an arms race and raise tension. It would be technically difficult and would require huge investment,"" Komeito leader Natsuo Yamaguchi said in an interview. ""This is something that has to be thought seriously about under the new Prime Minister.""
Even some LDP's security hawks, including one of Suga's leadership rivals, former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba, see a potential downside to acquiring long-range cruise missiles. 

""What happens if the United States asks Japan to fire them, and we don't want to?"" he asked.

(Reuters) - Anti-racism protesters recognize the risk that comes with their calls for equal justice, knowing that for all their peaceful protests, scenes of burning buildings will hand U.S. President Donald Trump the images he needs for his ""law and order"" re-election campaign.
But activists in hotspots such as Portland, Oregon, and Kenosha, Wisconsin, say they are confident voters are on their side and that they won't back down from a strategy that includes street demonstrations under the banner of Black Lives Matter.
""We're not intimidated,"" said Veronica King, leader of the Kenosha chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ""The voters have seen the videos (of police enforcement against Black men). I believe the voters are behind the movement and want change.""
With Trump, a Republican, trailing Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election, the president has seized on the violence coming from the protests, even though the majority have been peaceful.
""The Democrats never even mentioned the words LAW & ORDER at their National Convention,"" Trump tweeted on Thursday. ""If I don't win, America's Suburbs will be OVERRUN with Low Income Projects, Anarchists, Agitators, Looters and, of course, 'Friendly Protesters.'""
In Portland, where there have been more than 100 straight nights of demonstrations, protest leader Demetria Hester of Moms United for Black Lives called the fear campaign a ""publicity stunt"" and said the movement was undeterred.
""People are still dying and police aren't getting charged, and people ... see that and they aren't going to back down,"" Hester said.
Thousands of demonstrations spread across the United States following the May 25 death of George Floyd when a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. 
Protests flared anew after police in Kenosha shot Jacob Blake in the back on Aug. 23.
People from across the political spectrum flocked to these crucibles, pitting highly polarized factions against each other, sometimes with deadly results. A volatile mix of local and outside nighttime demonstrators, armed right-wing militias, and heavily equipped police occupied the same streets, leading to clashes.
A 17-year-old rifle-toting Trump supporter has been charged with killing two protesters and wounding a third in Kenosha. His lawyer says it was self-defense. In Portland, left-wing protester Michael Reinoehl was accused of killing a right-wing militiaman before police confronted and shot him. In a Vice interview before his death, the activist maintained he shot the militiaman in self-defense.
PEACEFUL PROTESTS
While those cases have grabbed headlines, more than 93% of recent demonstrations connected to Black Lives Matter were peaceful, according to a study by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), which monitors political violence in developing countries and started following the United States last year. 
Between May 26 and Aug. 22, ACLED recorded over 7,750 demonstrations linked to Black Lives Matter in 2,400 places. Violence was limited to fewer than 220 locations, mostly confined to a few blocks.
Where there is violence, peaceful demonstrators frequently complain of outsiders, often white, breaking windows or setting fires. A Milwaukee Journal Sentinel review of bookings into the Kenosha County Jail found 52 percent of the more than 250 people arrested one night came from outside the county.
A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found 53% of American adults said they remain sympathetic to people protesting against racial inequality.
Meanwhile, support for the Black Lives Matter movement has climbed to 49% among all Americans, up 18 points from a similar poll two years ago, rising 28 points among Democrats and 6 points among Republicans.
Still, the Trump campaign believes a law and order message will resonate with Americans. Samantha Zager, deputy national press secretary for the Trump campaign, said Biden lacked the courage to stand up to violence, even though he has repeatedly denounced it.
""(President Trump) has condemned the violence, demanded law and order, and taken action to protect our communities without hesitation,"" Zager said. 
Clyde McLemore of Black Lives Matter in Lake County, Illinois, near Kenosha, said the movement was being unfairly tarnished by the actions of a few. 
""I'm not for looting and I'm not for burning property,"" he said. ""It was not Black Lives Matter (causing violence). We disperse at eight o'clock.""
Still, he saw no reason to retreat from the streets, saying that would only give Trump what he wants and will delay justice.

""We're going to protest,"" McLemore said. ""That's our constitutional right.""

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday rejected Texas Democrats' bid to allow all state residents to vote by mail due to the coronavirus pandemic, ruling that the state's law extending that right only to those over 65 was not unconstitutional age discrimination.
A split three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a lower court's preliminary ruling that had required the state to expand mail-in voting to all eligible voters.
The Texas case is just one of dozens of court challenges across the country over whether to expand voting rights in light of the pandemic. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has asserted without evidence that voting by mail will result in fraud, although many states have used the practice for decades with no major problems.
Texas law allows voters over age 65, as well as those with certain disabilities, who are ill, absent from their home counties or confined to jail, to vote by mail. In a separate case, the state's high court ruled in May that the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus was not in itself a valid reason to allow mail-in ballots.
The 5th Circuit's majority said the state's law did not violate the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on age discrimination because it merely conferred an extra benefit on older residents, rather than limiting the right to vote for younger Texans.
""A law that makes it easier for others to vote does not abridge any person's right to vote,"" the majority wrote.
In dissent, U.S. Circuit Judge Carl Stewart said the law hurt younger voters by limiting their options during a public health crisis.
Thursday's ruling does not end the lawsuit. The case will return to a lower court to consider the Democrats' remaining arguments against the law.
""The Texas Democratic Party will continue to fight in the district court for every Texan to have an equal right to vote, regardless of their age,"" Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican who defended the state in the lawsuit, said in a statement: ""We will continue to protect the integrity of Texas elections and uphold the rule of law.""

Chile's National Emergency Office said it had detected no immediate harm to people, basic services or infrastructure. Its technical team was monitoring the situation.
The quake epicentre was midway between the cities of Calama,  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) and Iquique in the Norte Grande region of Chile that encompasses some of the country's biggest mines, including Chile's state-owned miner Codelco's Chuquicamata and Vancouver-based Teck Resources (NYSE:TECK)'s Quebrada Blanca. 
The Chilean navy's Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (SHOA) said the conditions had not been met to generate a tsunami.
Chile is the world's largest copper producer and most of its large operations are in Antofagasta region, about 88 km (54 miles) north-north east of the quake's epicenter, according to the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC). Mine facilities and other infrastructure in Chile are built to withstand large quakes.
Footage shared on social media from security cameras and local residents showed intense shaking for at least a minute.
Monitoring networks reported several smaller aftershocks following the first quake.
The quake is one of a significant number to hit northern Chile in the past 11 days, starting with one of 6.8 whose epicenter was near the port city of Huasco, midway between regional capital La Serena and Copiapo on September 1. Another earthquake of 6.2 struck Coquimbo, slightly further south, on Saturday.

838,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>","U.K. Agrees Post-Brexit Trade Deal With Japan, Boosting Johnson","(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. secured a free-trade agreement with Japan, its first major post-Brexit accord and a boost to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as negotiations deteriorate with the EU.
The deal, which is expected to boost Britain’s GDP by 0.07% compared to 2018 levels over the next 15 years, was agreed in principle by International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi on Friday, the British government said in a statement.
Striking an accord with the world’s third-largest economy has been a priority for Johnson, who is eager to demonstrate the ability to sign trade deals as an independent country -- a key plank of the Brexit campaign he led. The U.K. benefited from the EU-Japan free trade agreement and needed a deal to avoid tariffs on commerce with Japan at the end of the year.
Its timing is also useful to Johnson. Trade talks with the EU, Britain’s largest trading partner, have deteriorated sharply this week amid a U.K. plan to break international law over the Brexit divorce treaty. That move has soured negotiations and increased the prospect of no trade deal being reached by Dec. 31, when Britain exits post-Brexit transition arrangements.
The U.K. said 99% of exports to Japan will be tariff-free under the deal, which will add 15.2 billion pounds to annual trade with the Asian nation. It marks an “important step” toward joining the Comprehensive and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the government said.
Truss said the accord with Japan, negotiated in “record time and in challenging circumstances,” goes further than the deal it has with the EU, citing data flows and better market access for financial services.
“It secures new wins for British businesses in our great manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries,” she said in the statement. “This is a historic moment for the U.K.”
Motegi said the agreement would allow British and Japanese companies to maintain business continuity after Brexit and provide greater opportunities for investment.
“It was a very difficult negotiation but we were able to come to an agreement in principle in three months, an exceptional pace,” he said. “By agreeing on higher level, more progressive rules than the Japan EU trade deal on issues such as electronic commerce, we hope that trade and investment between Japan and the U.K. will increase further.”

Rallies are planned across the northeastern region later in the day. Over the past years, separatists have been holding major protests in favour of independence from Spain on Sept. 11 to mark ""La Diada"", the anniversary of the fall of Barcelona to Spanish forces in 1714. 
A spokesman for the rail operator said protesters had set fires in seven or eight places across Catalonia, with the majority concentrated in Girona where all train services have been cancelled.
Services on the high-speed line between Barcelona and Figueres, which connects to France's TGV network, have been interrupted, rail operator ADIF tweeted. 
A few fires were detected in Lleida but the service was operating normally, he said. Technicians were evaluating how to repair the tracks and restore normal service, he added.
Despite appeals from health officials to avoid gatherings amid the pandemic, grassroots organizer Assemblea Nacional Catalana said last week it wanted to hold Europe's largest coronavirus-adapted protest. 
It has planned for later on Friday over 100 gatherings in 82 locations in the northeastern region, in which people would need to keep a distance, wear a mask and have previously registered to attend.
This year, the Catalan separatist government has decided not to attend, urging caution due to the health crisis, although it said it respected the right to protest. The region's public health secretary and the head of a doctors' association discouraged such gatherings. 
Spain has recorded 554,143 cases since the onset of the pandemic, more than any other western European nation. It reported 13 deaths on Thursday, taking the overall toll to 29,699.
While Catalonia's separatism drive has dominated Spanish politics for years, it has largely taken a back seat over the past months, both because of the coronavirus crisis and divisions among separatists.

Opinion polls show people in the region are split on the issue of independence.

The delegates are expected to come in reciprocation of last week's groundbreaking Abu Dhabi visit by top Israeli and U.S. envoys, a source familiar with the planning said. Israeli officials have confirmed such a plan. The UAE has not.

Netanyahu and UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan will sign the normalisation deal at the White House on Tuesday. As a health precaution, Netanyahu and his family will fly to Washington on an executive jet, separate from an airliner chartered for the rest of the Israeli delegation, aides said.

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said none of the U.S. vaccine makers the government is in talks with had set conditions, adding all potential vaccines will undergo a regulatory process to ensure safety and efficacy. 
""No conditions were provided or given to us,"" Vergeire told a news conference. 
The Philippines, which is among a number of developing countries with big populations trying to secure a supply of COVID-19 vaccine, has met with U.S. vaccine manufacturers  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) and  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE).
It has also held discussions with China and Russia, which are among countries leading the global race to develop coronavirus inoculations.
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque said on Thursday that President Rodrigo Duterte's decision to pardon a U.S. marine convicted of killing a transgender woman nearly six years ago may have stemmed from his desire to ensure access to coronavirus vaccines. But Roque reiterated on Friday that he was merely stating a personal opinion.
Pemberton was serving a six- to 10-year sentence for killing Jennifer Laude near a former U.S. navy base in 2014. He will likely be released from a military jail and deported this weekend, the Bureau of Immigration said.
Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Manuel Romualdez said U.S. officials were ""surprised"" by the pardon. While they inquired about Pemberton, they did not push for his release, he told ANC News channel.
The Philippines has the most COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia, with more than 248,000 confirmed infections.

The Southeast Asian country plans to buy 40 million doses worth $400 million for 20 million people, about a fifth of its 107 million population.

LE CROTOY, France (Reuters) - Rebecca Pavy, manager of the Cavalcade equestrian centre in northern France, had one message for the police hunting whoever is responsible for a spate of killings and mutilations of horses.
""Catch them, catch them,"" she told three gendarme officers who visited her centre on Thursday to check on her security arrangements and give advice on what to do if the culprits strike.
Across France, horse breeders, pony clubs and equestrian centres are in a state of high alert after horses have been found with ears cut off, eyes gouged out, and genitals mutilated. 
Police say they have no idea what the motive is. Theories include a satanic rite, macabre trophy hunt, or internet challenge. In all, 150 investigations have been opened. Police this week detained a man they said was a suspect, but then released him without charge.
On Thursday, the gendarmes were visiting farms and riding centres in the countryside near the Channel port of Dieppe.
At the Levant Stable, the officers gave manager Jean Francois Decayeux a leaflet entitled: ""How to ensure the protection of my horses.""
He said he had brought in horses from outlying pastures and toured the property every evening to check on them. He also listens out for any unusual vehicles.
""We have no desire to take the law into our own hands, we will call the gendarmes straight away,"" he said, when asked what he would do if he encounters a suspect.
At Pavy's riding centre, surveillance cameras have been fitted in the pastures. Looking at the horse standing at her shoulder, she said it was hard to bear the thought of any of her horses falling victim to the mutilations. 

""Our horses are our passion. It's more than a job. It's a friend, a companion who spends a good portion of their life with us,"" she said.

BEIJING/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - China and India said on Friday they had agreed to de-escalate renewed tensions on their contested Himalayan border and take steps to restore ""peace and tranquillity"" following a high-level diplomatic meeting in Moscow. 
Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi and Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar met in Moscow on Thursday and reached a five-point consensus, including agreements that troops from both sides should quickly disengage and ease tensions, the two countries said in a joint statement.
The consensus, struck on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting, came after a confrontation in the border area in the western Himalayas earlier this week.
""The two Foreign Ministers agreed that the current situation in the border areas is not in the interest of either side. They agreed therefore that the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions,"" they said in the statement.
Jaishankar told Wang that the immediate task would be for troops to step back from the ""areas of friction"" so that things do not get worse, an Indian source said. Troops are barely a few hundred metres apart at some points.
China and India accused each other of firing into the air during the confrontation, a violation of long-held protocol not to use firearms on the sensitive frontier. 
Wang told Jaishankar the ""imperative is to immediately stop provocations such as firing and other dangerous actions that violate the commitments made by the two sides,"" China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday. 
Wang also told Jaishankar all personnel and equipment that have trespassed at the border must be moved to de-escalate the situation.
In June, tensions erupted into a frontier clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed and China suffered an unspecified number of casualties. 
Shares of defence-related firms fell in China on Friday after the news of progress in the talks, with the CSI National Defense Industry Index down 1.2% and on track for its steepest weekly decline since Oct. 12, 2018. Tongyu Heavy Industry shares tumbled as much as 16.4% at one point.
CHINESE BUILDUP 
The ministers' meeting lasted for two hours and was the latest diplomatic effort to head off a broader conflict between the world's two most populous countries, which went to war in 1962.
Jaishankar told Wang that India was deeply concerned about the buildup of Chinese forces on the Line of Actual Control on the poorly defined border. 
""The Chinese side has not provided a credible explanation for this deployment,"" an Indian government source quoted Jaishankar as saying at the meeting. 
""The provocative behavior of Chinese frontline troops at numerous incidents of friction along the LAC also showed disregard for bilateral agreements and protocols,"" Jaishankar said, adding any unilateral attempt to change status quo would be resisted.
China's Global Times, an influential tabloid published by the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, reported on Wednesday the People's Liberation Army (PLA) were moving soldiers, bombers and armoured vehicles into the border. 
Chinese state media also recently reported armed jump drills by PLA paratroopers in Tibet. 
The Global Times said in an editorial published late on Thursday that any talks with India should be paired with ""war readiness"".

""The Chinese side must be fully prepared to take military action when diplomatic engagement fails, and its frontline troops must be able to respond to emergencies, and be ready to fight at any time,"" the newspaper said.

COLOMBO/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A salvage team is still trying to plug a fuel leak from the fire-stricken New Diamond oil supertanker, Sri Lankan Navy spokesman Indika de Silva said on Friday.
The tanker, which is carrying the about 2 million barrels of oil, caught fire on Sept. 3 and is currently 45 nautical miles (83 km), off Sri Lanka's east coast. 
The fire has been extinguished but the New Diamond has left two long trails of fuel oil after the Navy towed it out to sea.
Authorities want to avoid damage to the coast line like that suffered by Mauritius after the Japanese bulk carrier MV Wakashio struck a coral reef off the Indian Ocean island on July 25 and began spilling oil on Aug. 6.
""Salvage operations are continuing. The engine room has been de-smoked. They have identified the bunker oil tank that is leaking. The next step is to empty it and then to repair the leak,"" de Silva said.
He said the cargo of crude oil remains intact. The stricken vessel has raised fears of an environmental disaster.
Sri Lanka's Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) has said it plans to take action against the ship's owner under the country's laws to protect the marine ecosystem.
A fire broke out in the engine room of the Greek-owned New Diamond tanker on Sept. 3. The fire was believed to have been extinguished on Sunday but reignited a day later.
The very large crude carrier was chartered by Indian Oil Corp to import oil to Paradip in eastern India from Kuwait.

New Shipping Ltd, the manager of the Panama-flagged New Diamond, has appointed SMIT Singapore Pte Ltd to lead salvage operations.

Taiwan, claimed by China as its own, says that Chinese forces carried out two-days of large-scale air and naval exercises off Taiwan's southwest and in its air defence identification zone, denouncing it as provocation.
China has stepped up its military activity around Taiwan this year.
Tsai, who was re-elected by a landslide in January promising to stand up to China, observed exercises and chatted to soldiers thanking them for their hard work, in video footage provided by the government.
""At the moment the Chinese Communist's aircraft harassing of Taiwan and military exercises have been quite frequent,"" Tsai said. ""I believe that everyone is clear about this situation in performing their mission, and know they have a huge responsibility.""
Taiwan's skies and people are safe because of their hard work, she added.
""I want to encourage everyone by saying 'don't give an inch of the nation's sovereignty, and hold fast to democracy and freedom'. This is our conviction and resolve to protect our home and defend our country. Please all take this to heart.""

China has not yet responded to Taiwan's complaints about the recent drills, which happened between mainland Taiwan and the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the northern part of the South China Sea.

The clash erupted a day earlier when the Nationals party of New South Wales (NSW) state objected to a ban on land-clearing in habitat deemed essential for the marsupials. The law was introduced in December amid ferocious bushfires that reportedly killed thousands of the native animals.
The rural-focused Nationals, who hold power with the larger conservative Liberals in an alliance dating from 1927, planned to overturn the law saying it deprived farmers of the right to manage their own land.
The Liberals, the larger coalition partner, held firm on the law, prompting the Nationals to say they might quit the ministry en masse, a move that would have left the state of 7.5 million people in turmoil as the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic.
However, on Friday Nationals leader and Deputy State Premier John Barilaro said his party would stay in their roles after Premier Gladys Berejiklian assured him the law would be on the agenda at a future cabinet meeting.
""We've made a compromise about when, she's made a compromise about it becoming an agenda item,"" Barilaro told reporters. ""We've conceded in some part but so have the Liberals.""
Berejiklian said in a joint statement with Barilaro that ""the NSW Liberal and Nationals Coalition remains in place"", including ""a commitment to supporting cabinet conventions and processes"".

The Nationals hold 13 seats in the NSW lower house while the Liberals hold 35, giving the coalition a majority in the 93-member house.

Orban told state radio that a mandatory wearing of masks on public transport must be enforced and if necessary mask-wearing would be more widely imposed later. But he said the second wave of the pandemic required a different strategy than the first, which dealt a blow to the economy in March and April.
""The goal now is not for everyone to stay at home, and for the country to come to a standstill. The goal is to protect the ability of the country to keep operating,"" Orban said.
""We cannot afford the virus crippling the country again.""
Orban also said the Visegrad states of the European Union - Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland - would coordinate their measures to fight the pandemic. Premiers of the four states will meet in Poland later in the day.
Hungary has closed its borders to foreigners since Sept. 1 to curb a rise in coronavirus cases. Subsequently, Hungary decided to exempt tourists visiting from Visegrad states, provided they test negative for COVID-19 before arriving, prompting a rebuke from the European Commission.
""In the all-European crisis, we can create a Central European island, where, by applying special rules, the possibility of movement...remains,"" Orban said on Friday. 
He also said the government would impose a mandatory price fixed by the authorities on COVID tests.
Hungary registered 476 new COVID-19 infections on Thursday, bringing the total number of cases to 10,191.

Gross domestic product data have shown a year-on-year contraction of 8.2%-13.6% in countries across central Europe. Hungary was the worst hit, with its second quarter GDP falling 13.6%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Victoria Azarenka stunned Serena Williams (NYSE:WMB) 1-6 6-3 6-3 in the semi-finals of the U.S. Open on Thursday, denying the American the chance of winning a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam singles title on home soil this year.
Azarenka will play Japan's Naomi Osaka on Saturday in her third final at Flushing Meadows, having lost the previous two to Williams in 2012 and 2013. 
Azarenka said her mental game had been crucial in beating the 38-year-old Williams, who needed a medical timeout to have her left ankle re-taped in the third set due to Achilles trouble.
""I have been working on finding a calm mind and keep the body going,"" the Belarusian said in an on-court interview. ""She dug me in a big hole in the first set. I needed to find energy to climb out of the hole and it wasn't easy.""
Williams, who has been stuck on 23 Grand Slam titles since winning the 2017 Australian Open, said the defeat was ""obviously disappointing"". 
""At the same time ... I did what I could today,"" she added.
""I feel like other times I've been close and I could have done better. Today I felt like I gave a lot.""
Six-times U.S. Open champion Williams came out firing winners from all sides of the Arthur Ashe Stadium court while Azarenka struggled with her serve, committing four double faults in the first set and winning just six of 15 first-serve points.
She also had 10 unforced errors and appeared increasingly frustrated, with a mic catching her muttering a pair of expletives at herself before Williams took a 4-1 lead.
Williams wrapped up the opening set in little more than half an hour but Azarenka seized momentum in the second frame, breaking the third seed's serve with a pair of backhand winners from the baseline to take a 3-2 lead.
Playing her first Grand Slam semi-final in seven years, Azarenka got the better of Williams in some explosive exchanges of power-hitting while her serve also saw major improvement.
The 31-year-old took the set to force a decider after winning nearly 75% of her first-serve points and committing just one unforced error.
The twice Australian Open champion kept up the pressure in the third set and looked to be in a deep meditative state as Williams had her ankle taped, not even reacting as an insect landed on the bridge of her nose as she waited to resume the match. 

Azarenka then sealed her place in the final with an ace.

Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, who has led Tokyo’s team on the pact, told reporters in Tokyo he will be speaking with U.K. Trade Secretary Liz Truss on the agreement. Japan’s existing accord with the European Union, which includes the U.K., runs until the end of the year.
The U.K. expects the deal to increase trade with Japan by about 15 billion pounds ($19.2 billion) a year in the long term. Trade between Britain and Japan was valued at more than 39 billion pounds last year, and Japan is the U.K.’s eleventh-largest export market.
Motegi said earlier this month that Japan is seeking to reach the agreement before Prime Minister Shinzo Abe steps down, which is expected to take place on Sept 16. Abe said he’s leaving office for health reasons.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Bolivia's interim government led by President Jeanine Anez is using the justice system to persecute her predecessor Evo Morales and his allies and supporters, Human Rights Watch said in a report published on Friday. 
Terrorism charges announced against former leftist president Morales over deadly unrest after he fled the country last November following disputed elections appeared to be ""politically motivated"", the group said.
The charges related to a single phone call days after Morales left Bolivia in which he urged a supporter to ""fight"" the interim government, HRW said, and the 20-year prison term sought for the alleged offence was ""wholly disproportionate.""
Terrorism charges brought against Morales's former lawyer and chief of staff were based on phone contact she had with him, it added, while a Morales supporter was charged with sedition for describing the new government as ""dictatorial."" 
The U.S.-based group said that it interviewed Interior Minister Arturo Murillo and Ombudsman Nadia Cruz along with justice officials during its enquiry.
It was also given access to thousands of court documents and police reports relating to 21 cases of the more than 100 former Morales administration members or supporters accused of crimes including terrorism, sedition, belonging to a criminal organization and dereliction of duty. 
It said it uncovered evidence that Morales had also used the justice system against his opponents during his 13 years in office, but that Anez ""had a chance to break with the past and ensure judicial independence."" 
Instead, said José Miguel Vivanco, HRW's Americas director, her government publicly pressurized prosecutors and judges ""to further its interests.""
""It is crucial for justice officials... not to serve as a tool to persecute the political opponents of whatever administration is in power,” he said. 
The HRW findings will do little to alleviate simmering tensions as the South American nation heads for a presidential election on Oct. 18 that has been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The Anez government this week referred opposition supporters who led protests and road blockades against the pandemic-related delay to the International Criminal Court, saying that cutting civilians off from medical help constituted ""crimes against humanity.""

On Monday a Bolivian court rejected a legal appeal by Morales against a ruling that banned him for running for a senate seat on the grounds he is no longer a Bolivian resident.

The Vancouver-based research institution warned in its 2020 Economic Freedom of the World report that the sweeping national security law enacted in June and other measures would hurt Hong Kong’s No. 1 ranking in future surveys. The former British colony continued its 24-year run atop the latest report, which was based on data from 2018, ahead of Singapore and New Zealand.
“Hong Kong’s rating in this report is unaffected by the 2019 proposal to transfer certain legal cases to the mainland and the protest and sometimes brutal suppression that followed,” the right-leaning think tank said. “However, it will be surprising if the apparent increase in the insecurity of property rights and the weakening of the rule of law caused by the interventions of the Chinese government in 2019 and 2020 do not result in lower scores.”
Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam has cited the city’s continued high rankings in the Fraser report and similar surveys to counter claims that efforts to crackdown on political unrest were jeopardizing its status as a global financial center. The security law imposed by China gave the government vast new authority to prosecute subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers, including the ability to transfer cases to mainland courts.
The government dismissed the report’s assertions, saying it remained determined and committed to upholding the rule of law. “It is with regret that Fraser Institute preempts lower future scores in this area with biased comments and unfair speculations based on selective ungrounded views,” the government said in a statement Friday.
The decision to impose the security law without a public hearing or vote was arguably the most dramatic shock to Hong Kong’s political system since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The government has already used the law to outlaw protest slogans and arrest more than 20 activists, including media tycoon Jimmy Lai.
The legislation has prompted the U.S. to roll back special trading privileges granted to Hong Kong while technology companies have accelerated efforts to move sensitive data out of the city. On Thursday, Hong Kong police arrested 15 people on suspicion of manipulating the stock price of Lai’s Next Digital Ltd. during a campaign to support the company after his arrest last month.
Hong Kong slipped to second place in the Heritage Foundation’s 2020 Index of Economic Freedom, due to last year’s political turmoil. The city also tumbled seven spots to 80th place in the Reporters Without Borders’ latest 2020 World Press Freedom Index.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia opposes the release of an Afghan soldier, jailed for killing three of its military personnel in 2012, as part of a prisoner transfer deal to help usher in peace talks in the war-torn country, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said on Friday.
Six prisoners sought by the Taliban left Kabul on a flight to Doha on Thursday evening, two government sources told Reuters, with the Taliban confirming it would attend long-awaited peace talks. [nL4N2FJ2HM]
Payne said one of the six was Hekmatullah, a former Afghan army sergeant who killed three Australian solders in 2012. She said Canberra did not support the prisoner transfer.
""Hekmatullah should serve a full custodial sentence for the crimes for which he was convicted by an Afghan court, and he should not be released as part of a prisoner amnesty,"" Payne said in an emailed statement.
The United States and other international players have been urging the insurgent Taliban and the Afghan government to the negotiating table to bring an end to 19 years of war.
A key pillar for the end of hostilities is the demand by the insurgent group that up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 government prisoners would be released before talks.

The incident, involving four Chinese state media journalists, was revealed by China's foreign ministry this week, in the wake of two Australian journalists departing China after questioning by Chinese police.
Relations between Australia and top trading partner China are at a low ebb after Beijing was angered by Canberra's call for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, responding with trade reprisals, and Australia toughened national security tests for foreign investment.
Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said the Australian security agencies had acted according to the law.
""We appropriately respond in relation to any foreign interference concerns that are raised in Australia,"" he told the ABC News Breakfast television programme, when asked about the incident.
""We do it purely in relation to the evidence,"" he added.
Birmingham denied suggestions the June raid had provoked a retaliation from Beijing which saw exit bans placed on journalists from the Australian Broadcasting Corp and the Australian Financial Review newspaper in China last week, and the pair seeking consular protection.
China has accused the Australian embassy of obstructing law enforcement when it sheltered the two journalists who were wanted for questioning in the country and returned to Australia this week.
Birmingham denied this and said Australian embassy officials had respected China's processes to negotiate an outcome.
""The embassy engaged diligently to ensure the safety of the two individuals concerned, but they also engaged cooperatively with Chinese officials to ensure the resolution of the matter, which included the opportunity for Chinese authorities to interview the individuals concerned,"" he told ABC radio.

Another Australian citizen, Chinese television anchor Cheng Lei, was detained by Chinese authorities in August.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - It was with a kiss that student activist Tattep Ruangprapaikitseree first took centre stage in Thai politics.
His embrace with his boyfriend at parliament as they campaigned for gay marriage rights last December shocked conservatives and stirred a social media storm.
Nine months on, the changes he now demands for Thailand are even more fundamental for the protest movement challenging an establishment long dominated by the army and the palace.
""I'm confused as to how I got here,"" Tattep, 23, told Reuters.
Since mid-July, protesters have been calling for the departure of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former coup leader. They want a new constitution, fresh elections and an end to the harassment of activists.
Some protesters also seek reforms to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's Royal Palace.
Although there is no overall leader of the fragmented movement - and activists say they want to keep it that way - a July 18 protest by Tattep's Free Youth Movement unexpectedly drew some 2,500 people and helped to build momentum for almost daily demonstrations since.
""At that time, there was no one leading the protest, so I decided to do it,"" said Tattep, also known by the nickname Ford.
The government was not opposed to demonstrations, spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri said.
""Youths can express their thoughts as long as it is under the rule of law. I want them to avoid sensitive issues because it can create conflicts among people,"" he said.
The Palace did not respond to requests for comment.
Tattep grew up in the heart of Bangkok. His father works as a delivery driver for a mobile phone app. When Tattep's mother died six years ago, they moved into one room in a shared house while he completed his studies.
""I support him because the movement is for the country: it's not only about him,"" said his father, Somrak Ruangprapaikitseree. 
But his father worries the protests could turn violent, recalling the decade of bloody street turmoil before Prayuth's 2014 coup.
YELLOW VERSUS RED
Tattep said his political awareness began during those protests, when pro-establishment yellow shirts shut down Bangkok in clashes with red shirt supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
While Tattep had initially hoped to be a pharmacist, he switched to political science and graduated from Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University this year.
He and boyfriend Panumas Singprom met on Tinder and realised they had been going to the same political meetings.
""We don't want to grow old and have our kids ask us 'When the country faced injustice what did you do?'"" said Panumas, who is often by his side.
Last year's election fuelled calls for change after Prayuth returned as prime minister in a vote his opponents said was unfair. Prayuth says the vote was fair.
As well as campaigning for LGBT rights, they set up a discussion forum on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that became the Free Youth Movement - and later the Free People Movement to broaden its appeal.
""Let it end in our generation,"" shouted Tattep as he took the stage on Aug. 16 at a Bangkok demonstration of more than 10,000 people, the biggest yet.
Prominent right-winger Warong Dechgitvigrom said youth protesters such as Tattep were being misled, particularly when it came to questioning the monarchy.
""There's no way high school or university students can profoundly understand politics,"" he told Reuters.
Tattep has taken a less radical approach than some student leaders, who have publicly set out 10 points for reform of the monarchy. But he said this is simply because he sees constitutional change, rather than monarchy reform, as the priority.
Sought by police for their part in organising the July 18 protest, Tattep and Panumas were arrested on Aug. 26. They were among at least a dozen activists charged with breaching internal security laws and an emergency decree to stop the spread of coronavirus. They were released on bail the same day.
Tattep said the charges would not stop him.

""I'm pressured by the government, people from the movement, the opposition and even supporters because they are expecting me to lead,"" he said. ""It is worth it if I can be part of a movement that leads the country to true democracy.""

About 3 miles (5 km) from the Naf River that marks the border between Myanmar’s Rakhine state and Bangladesh, Kan Kya was home to hundreds of people before the army chased 730,000 Rohingya out of the country in 2017 in what the United Nations described as ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing."" 
The Myanmar military, now facing charges of genocide, said it was conducting “clearance operations” targeting militants.
Where Kan Kya once stood, there are now dozens of government and military buildings including a sprawling, fenced off police base, according to satellite images publicly available on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Earth and historical images provided to Reuters by Planet Labs. The village, in a remote region in the northwest of the country closed off to foreigners, was too small to be named on Google Maps. 
On maps produced in 2020 by the United Nations mapping unit in Myanmar, which it says are based on Myanmar government maps, the site of the destroyed village is now nameless and reclassified as part of nearby town Maungdaw. The unit makes maps for the use of U.N. bodies, such as refugee agency UNHCR, and humanitarian groups that work with the United Nations in the field.
Kan Kya was one of almost 400 villages destroyed by the Myanmar military in 2017, according to satellite images analysed by New York-based Human Rights Watch. And it is one of at least a dozen whose names have been erased. 
“Their intention is that we do not return,” said religious leader Mohammed Rofiq, a former chairman of a village close to Kan Kya who now lives in a refugee camp in Bangladesh, referring to the Myanmar government. 
The Ministry of Social Welfare, which oversees Myanmar’s rebuilding activities in Rakhine state, declined to answer questions from Reuters about the erasure of village names or the government’s policy concerning the return of Rohingya refugees. The ministry referred questions to the General Administration Department (GAD), which did not respond. 
A representative of the Myanmar government, led by state counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, also did not respond to a request for comment. 
The United Nations’ map department has produced at least three maps since the start of the year that show a number of Rohingya village names have disappeared or been reclassified by Myanmar.
The United Nations said it removed some maps of Rakhine state from its website in June and started a study to assess the impact of the government’s policies on villagers and returning refugees after the Arakan Rohingya National Organisation, a UK-based Rohingya rights group, complained to the United Nations about the removal of village names. The United Nations said the study has not reached any conclusion. 
Yanghee Lee, a former U.N. human rights envoy to Myanmar, said the government was purposefully making it hard for refugees to return to places with no name and no evidence that they ever lived there. “This is a way of exterminating their basic identity,” she said. 
Lee said the United Nations was complicit in allowing that to happen by not challenging the Myanmar government: “There hasn’t been any leadership that will say, ‘Wait a minute, the buck stops here, we’re not going to let this continue.’” 
Several U.N. officials interviewed by Reuters declined to directly address why the United Nations had raised no objections or tried to stop it.  
Ola Almgren, head of the U.N. mission to Myanmar, said he had not raised the issue of erasing village names with the Myanmar government, but said he had urged the Myanmar government to create ""conditions conducive"" to the return of refugees.
Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the reclassification of some villages as wards was a “routine administrative procedure.” The U.N. mapping unit “utilizes the official government names of places so as to avoid confusion among aid workers and government officials in the field,” he said. “The standing U.N. practice worldwide is to employ officially designated place names for all publicly distributed maps and products.” 
Dujarric said that changing the legal status of villages may become “an additional layer of complexity” in refugees reclaiming their former homes, without providing specifics.  
BUILDING QUICKLY
Buddhist-majority Myanmar denies citizenship to Muslim Rohingya, whom many regard as interlopers from neighbouring Bangladesh despite their centuries-long presence in the country. Myanmar has said it is open to the return of Rohingya refugees who fled the crackdown in 2017, but said it must be done through an orderly process.
Talks on that process between Myanmar and Bangladesh - where more than 1 million Rohingya live in refugee camps - have stalled. In recent months, the few dozen refugees who have tried to return have been arrested for illegal entry by Myanmar officials who cited concerns about refugees spreading the new coronavirus.
Satellite images taken by Planet Labs, a San Francisco-based private satellite operator founded by former NASA scientists, and Google Earth show that Myanmar started building on the sites of at least a dozen destroyed villages soon after residents fled in 2017. Myanmar is constructing bases for the security forces, buildings for government departments and homes for Buddhists, according to people in the area.
The satellite images show the base built on the site of Kan Kya doubled in size in the past year and two helipads were added. A new road has been built over the site of another razed village nearby called Gone Nar, which has also been reclassified as part of the expanded Maungdaw town.
A spokesman for the military did not respond to a request for comment on the building of security bases on the sites of destroyed Rohingya villages. Local officials could not be reached for comment.
In September 2019, an order by the GAD, part of the military-run Home Affairs Ministry, reclassified 16 villages, most of them formerly Rohingya, as wards of Maungdaw, according to the U.N. mapping unit in Myanmar. Six of the village names were retained in the names of the new wards they were reclassified as belonging to, but 10 village names disappeared from the maps, according to the United Nations. 
Five of these villages were destroyed in 2017. GAD figures show Rohingya, which it classifies as “foreigners” from Bangladesh, now account for about 60% of the Maungdaw population, compared with 93% in 2017, before the crackdown. 
Hundreds of other destroyed villages have not had their names changed or erased, according to U.N. maps.
WALLS AND WATCHTOWERS
The United Nations said 11 other villages had been reclassified over the last five years as wards of a new town named Myin Hlut, where one Myanmar government minister has proposed a beach and seafood tourist area.

These small villages along the coast were mostly destroyed in the 2017 crackdown, though two remained intact until authorities bulldozed them in 2018. Six new guard stations with watchtowers have been erected in the area, according to a satellite imagery analyst at Amnesty International. 
As the Rohingya villages disappeared from the maps, two villages for Buddhist settlers were added to U.N. maps in 2020.
In Inn Din, a village where Myanmar soldiers killed 10 Muslim men in one incident during the 2017 crackdown, the 6,000 Rohingya people who lived there have all fled and their homes have been destroyed. 
(To read the Reuters SPECIAL REPORT on Inn Din, click here https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-rakhine-events.)
The Rakhine state government has built new dwellings for Buddhists in the area, Reuters reported in 2018. Satellite images show the site has expanded further since then, while in neighboring Kyauk Pandu, a Rakhine Buddhist settlement has doubled in size.
Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, noted that the International Court of Justice, which is investigating charges of genocide against Myanmar over the 2017 crackdown, has ordered the government to preserve any evidence related to the charges, which Myanmar has agreed to do. 
He did not say whether the United Nations believed the erasure of village names contravened that order or what the United Nations was doing to stop it.  
A Bangladesh official with knowledge of the process of repatriating Rohingya refugees told Reuters that Myanmar showed no change in its policy towards the Rohingya.
In March, the official said, Myanmar sent to Bangladesh a list of names of 840 Rohingya it had approved to return to two areas in northern Rakhine: Hla Poe Kaung and Thet Kay Pin.
But the refugees were not from that area, the official said, and the list included single members from large families including women unlikely to travel alone.
A representative of Myanmar’s Ministry of Social Welfare told Reuters there were “some gaps in communications” between Myanmar and Bangladesh on the matter of returning refugees, which the representative blamed on the postponement of a meeting due to the coronavirus. 
Satellite images of the areas to which Myanmar proposed they return showed one large settlement ringed by walls and watchtowers and a smaller one nearby. Both were built on top of razed Rohingya villages. Rohingya leaders have said they will return only to original village plots where they can build their own homes, not to camps.
In a closed-door address to the U.N. General Assembly last month, a transcript of which was seen by Reuters, the U.N. special envoy to Myanmar raised the issue of stalled repatriation of Rohingya refugees, saying “greater confidence-building measures” were needed to assuage refugee fears.

""It's alarming,"" said Jafar Ahmed, another former resident of the area. ""I don't know if we will ever get back our land.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday it would work with allies to hold accountable those responsible for poisoning Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, including ""through restricting  funds for  malign activities.""
""Russia has used  chemical nerve agents  from the 'Novichok' group  in the past.  The Russian people have  a right to express their views  without fear of retribution of any kind,"" the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Cherith Norman-Chalet, told a council meeting on chemical weapons in Syria.
The Kremlin critic is being treated in Berlin's Charite hospital after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight last month. Germany says he was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent. Moscow has said it has seen no evidence that Navalny, 44, was poisoned.
""We urge Russia to cooperate fully with the international community's investigation,"" Norman-Chalet told the council.   ""Wherever the evidence leads, we will work with allies and the international community to hold perpetrators accountable, including through restricting  funds for  malign activities.""
Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Russia wanted to know what happened to Navalny but that Russian authorities did not have any grounds to open an investigation as they did not have any evidence. 
""Our doctors who, by the way, saved Alexey Navalny did not find any chemical weapon substances in his analyses. The German laboratory claims it did,"" he told the Security Council. 
""But we received no evidence from Germany that would allow us to make a conclusion that it was a crime by attempted poisoning and thus start an investigation,"" he added. 
Germany's U.N. ambassador, Christoph Heusgen, said Berlin was working with the global chemical weapons watchdog - the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) - on the issue and urged Moscow to do the same. 

""It's not a bilateral issue – it's an issue of international concern (when) chemical agents are used, and therefore, the OPCW will have all the evidence and it would be very good if Russia would work with OPCW,"" Heusgen told the council.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>","Vaccine confidence volatile, vulnerable to misinformation, global study finds","By Kate Kelland
LONDON (Reuters) - Political polarisation and online misinformation are threatening vaccination programmes worldwide, with public trust volatile and varying widely between countries, according to a global vaccine confidence study.
The study, which maps trends in vaccine confidence across 149 countries between 2015 and 2019, found that scepticism about the safety of vaccines tended to grow alongside political instability and religious extremism.
""It is vital with new and emerging disease threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic, that we regularly monitor public attitudes,"" said Heidi Larson, a professor at the London school of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who led the research.
""Perceptions about vaccines are much more volatile than they used to be,"" she told a briefing. ""Overall, there's a lot of confidence in the world about vaccines. But don't take it for granted. Confidence goes up and down ... it's highly variable.""
Published in the Lancet medical journal, Larson's findings are based on data from more than 284,000 adults asked in 2019 whether they see vaccines as important, safe and effective.
Larson said that with drugmakers and researchers around the world racing to develop vaccines against the COVID-19 pandemic, governments should be now be extra vigilant about assessing public trust in vaccines and responding rapidly to concerns.
""There's a lot of anxiety about the speed of vaccine development (for COVID-19),"" she said. ""But the public is not really keen on speed - they're more keen on thoroughness, effectiveness and safety.""
The study's results show that vaccine confidence in Europe is low compared to other regions of the world, such as Africa, with the proportion of people strongly agreeing that vaccines are safe ranging from 19% in Lithuania to 66% in Finland. 
Iraq, Liberia and Senegal had the highest proportion of respondents in 2019 who agreed vaccines are important.
But public trust in vaccines has risen in some European countries since 2015, including France, Italy, Ireland and Britain.
The study found six countries where vaccine confidence had dropped significantly since 2015. 
In Indonesia, Pakistan, Serbia, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the proportion of people strongly disagreeing that vaccines are safe had increased significantly. This, Larson said, was linked to trends in political instability and religious extremism in these countries.
""Among some countries, there is more polarisation of sentiment. More people are going to the extremes of 'strongly disagree' or 'strongly agree',"" she said.

Indonesia saw one of the largest falls in public trust worldwide between 2015 and 2019, triggered in part by Muslim leaders questioning the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, and by local healers promoting natural alternatives to vaccines.

859,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>","Protests flare in Libya's Benghazi over power cuts, living conditions","BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Scores of people protested in Benghazi on Thursday over power cuts and living conditions, witnesses said, burning tyres and blocking some roads in an unusual public show of dissent in the eastern Libyan city. 
Benghazi is the base of Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA), which is fighting in a civil war against the internationally recognised Government of National Accord in Tripoli, in the country's west. 
Electricity supply has deteriorated this year, leading to protests last month in Tripoli and adding to poor living standards amid a surge in cases of the novel coronavirus.
The most immediate cause of the worsening power supply is a lack of fuel for electricity plants. The LNA has accused the Tripoli-based National Oil Corp (NOC) of not importing enough fuel to operate the plants. 
The NOC last month warned of worse blackouts in eastern Libya, saying the shortage was caused by the LNA's months-long blockade of oil and gas facilities. It said imports of diesel to operate the plants were causing it ""severe financial difficulties"".
The NOC has appealed for the LNA to end the blockade, which began in January and has drastically cut production, leading to a near total eclipse of energy revenue - Libya's main source of foreign currency - this year. 
The LNA is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt. The GNA is supported by Turkey. 
Earlier on Thursday, the European Union said its naval mission in the Mediterranean had stopped a ship heading from the UAE to Benghazi carrying jet fuel on suspicion of breaking an arms embargo. 
Peacemaking efforts in Libya have accelerated since a major bout of warfare earlier this year ended in June with the frontlines solidifying near the city of Sirte. 
Members of the two sides' rival parliamentary assemblies have been meeting this week in Morocco and said on Thursday they had agreed criteria for appointing senior figures in sovereign institutions, representing a step forward in the talks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A panel of judges on Thursday declared unlawful a directive from President Donald Trump to exclude people who are in the United States illegally from representation when apportioning congressional seats.
The decision by a three-judge panel, which could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, is a victory for the 38 states, cities and counties, plus several immigrants rights nonprofits, that sued over the July 21 directive.
The mostly Democratic-leaning plaintiffs, led by New York state, accused the Republican president of having a ""xenophobic"" purpose in pushing an unconstitutional directive that reflected ""discriminatory animus"" toward Hispanics and other immigrant communities.
They said the directive could leave several million people uncounted and shift a few House of Representatives seats, with California, Texas and New Jersey most likely to suffer losses.
In its 86-page decision, the panel said Trump exceeded his statutory authority in ordering the directive.
It said federal law required the use of one set of numbers to count people for census and apportionment purposes, and that so long as they resided in the United States, ""illegal aliens qualify as 'persons in' a 'state'"" who should be counted.
""The President must act in accordance with, and within the boundaries of, the authority that Congress has granted,"" the panel said. ""We conclude that the President did not do so.""
The White House and the Department of Commerce, which oversees the census, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Thursday's decision is a fresh census-related legal setback for Trump, who has made curbing immigration a focus of his presidency and reelection campaign.
His directive came one year after the Supreme Court blocked his attempt to add a citizenship question to the census.
""President Trump's repeated attempts to hinder, impair, and prejudice an accurate census and the subsequent apportionment have failed once again,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.
In defending the directive, government lawyers said Trump had broad discretion to decide who to count, and that any harm was speculative.
The plaintiffs countered that the directive would cause irreparable harm by dissuading immigrant households from census participation and reducing political power.
Census data is also used to allocate billions of dollars of federal funds.
""The law is clear - every person counts in the census,"" said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Dale Ho, who represented the nonprofits.

The panel consisted of Circuit Judges Richard Wesley and Peter Hall, both appointed to the bench by Republican President George W. Bush, and District Judge Jesse Furman, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama.

MEOQUI, Chihuahua (Reuters) - Prosecutors in Mexico are questioning 17 militarized police involved in a gunfight that killed a woman and left her husband injured, officials said on Thursday, after tensions flared in protests against a dam diverting water to the United States. 
On Wednesday, the National Guard militarized police said two people were killed after its officers ""repelled aggression"" from armed civilians in the town of Delicias in drought-hit northern Chihuahua state, following violent demonstrations at the nearby La Boquilla dam. 
But officials on Thursday said the husband had survived and was hospitalized with serious injuries. 
At a memorial for Jessica Silva, 36, her mother said the couple were ""peaceful people"" who wanted to support the family's farm.
""The only thing we are fighting for is what belongs to us, the water, for us farmers because everything is drying up,"" Justina Zamarripa said between tears.
A family friend, Carolina Lopez, said Silva was not armed. 
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters he lamented Silva's death and called for an investigation into whether she was killed by the National Guard.
A spokesman for the National Guard, which was created by Lopez Obrador's administration to improve crime-fighting, said 17 agents were cooperating with a probe.
Farmers have been protesting a plan to divert additional water across the northern border due to Mexico's ""water-debt"" stemming from a 1944 bilateral treaty that regulates water sharing between the neighbors.
Chihuahua Governor Javier Corral on Wednesday said the victims had protested at La Boquilla, where demonstrators hurled Molotov cocktails and rocks at security troops, eventually occupying the dam and closing the sluice gates. 
The couple then encountered the National Guard in the evening on the road to Delicias. 
""On the way back, they were attacked, according to various testimonies... by elements of the National Guard,"" Corral said.
The region's dry spell has affected crops. Farmers and protesters say the government needs to prioritize water shortages over diplomatic agreements.

Trump is to host a signing ceremony next Tuesday that will include delegations with Israel and the UAE. His negotiators have been trying to get other Gulf nations, such as Bahrain and Oman, to join in normalizing relations with Israel.
Israel and the UAE agreed last month to normalize relations in a deal that Trump helped orchestrate.
""Next week at the White House we'll be having a signing between the UAE and Israel, and we could have another country added into that. And I will tell you that countries are lining up that want to go into it,"" Trump told a White House news conference.
Trump, who is seeking re-election on Nov. 3, did not disclose the name of the country that might be the next to join, but predicted that Saudi Arabia would eventually do so.
""You'll be hearing other countries coming in over a relatively short period of time. And you could have peace in the Middle East,"" he said.
""I think what ultimately will happen is you're going to have quite a few countries come in. The big ones are going to be coming in. I spoke to the king of Saudi Arabia, so we're talking. We just started the dialogue. And you'll have them come in,"" he said.
The Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to a query on whether the Saudi ambassador or another Saudi representative would attend next week's signing ceremony at the White House.
Trump said he believed the Palestinians, who have denounced Trump's Middle East peace initiative as too favorable to Israel, would ultimately ""get back into the fold"" and open a dialogue.

""I'm frankly surprised they haven't been to the table earlier,"" said Trump, who added the United States would consider lifting a freeze on aid to the Palestinians if a deal can be reached with them.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A large fire erupted at Beirut port on Thursday, engulfing parts of the Lebanese capital in a pall of smoke weeks after a massive blast devastated the port and ruined a swathe of the city.
The blaze began in the shattered duty-free zone of the port, prompting some residents to flee the city still traumatised by last month's explosion that had followed a port fire.
Army helicopters dropped water as firefighters battled on the ground to bring the blaze under control. By nightfall, officials said most flames had been extinguished. Smoke still rose from smouldering wreckage but it was far less dense.
The blaze strained nerves already on edge. The city is reeling from the Aug. 4 port blast and the nation is grappling with a deep economic crisis that has posed the biggest threat to Lebanon's stability since its 1975-1990 civil war.
""For sure we were scared, it's only been a month since the explosion that destroyed Beirut. We saw the same thing happening again,"" 53-year-old Andre Muarbes said after soot and ash settled on vehicles and buildings across parts of the capital.
Lebanese President Michel Aoun said at a meeting of the Supreme Defence Council about the blaze that the fire could have been the result of sabotage, technical error or negligence, and the cause had to be uncovered quickly.
Many Lebanese are frustrated that they have yet to be told about any initial findings from an investigation into last month's port explosion that killed about 190 and injured 6,000.
Officials said no one had been injured in Thursday's fire although some suffered shortness of breath.
A source in the Supreme Defence Council said the port chief told the council in a report the fire was caused by repair welding work. Sparks fell on warehouses storing flammable items, including food items held there by aid agencies, the source said, adding that the military police would investigate.
A security source had also blamed welding work for the fire preceding the Aug. 4 port blast.
SHOCK
The Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross said it had aid in a warehouse that was on fire. ""Our humanitarian operation risks to be seriously disrupted,"" ICRC Middle East director Fabrizio Carboni wrote on Twitter.
Beirut's port is used by aid agencies to supply refugees in Lebanon and people in need in neighbouring Syria.
A military source said Thursday's blaze appeared to have started when cooking oil caught fire and spread to stores of tyres. Television footage had shown flames licking up near a pile of tyres in a warehouse ruined in last month's explosion.
Majed Hassanein, 49, was taking his wife and two children out of the capital by car during the height of the blaze. ""I am forced to get them out of Beirut from the smoke and the fire that is happening at the port again,"" he said.
He said his son still suffered from shock from the blast that ruined a swathe of capital and left about 300,000 people without habitable homes and shattering windows across Beirut.
Carmen Geha, an activist and assistant professor at the American University of Beirut, said the fire was further proof of mismanagement by a ruling elite, who have dragged the nation into crisis after years of corruption and poor governance.
""It's a gross crime, gross negligence and gross arrogance,"" she said. ""You can't trust them to manage anything.""

Firefighters were shown on television dousing the fire surrounded by mangled remains of warehouses destroyed in last month's explosion, which was caused by a store of ammonium nitrate kept in poor condition at the port for years.

(Reuters) - An Iranian-flagged tanker transporting fuel is sailing round Africa's Cape of Good Hope en route to the Atlantic Ocean, according to Refinitiv Eikon's vessel tracking data.
The medium-size vessel Forest, carrying about 300,000 barrels of fuel loaded at Iran's Bandar Abbas terminal, is bound for Venezuela, according to sources with knowledge of the shipment.
Gasoline scarcity in Venezuela has worsened again in recent days due to insufficient domestic production, leaving long lines of drivers waiting in front of stations and increasing the need for imported fuel.
Iran sent a first flotilla of five fuel tankers to Venezuela between May and June to help its political ally, which is also under U.S. sanctions. The vessels arrived in Venezuelan state-run PDVSA's ports without interferences.
But a second group of four Liberia-flagged tankers owned by a Greek shipping group did not arrive at the South American nation in July as the fuel was seized by Washington under a court order. The fuel is expected to be auctioned as part of the court action in the United States.
Two other Iranian tankers of the same size that also loaded fuel in August, the Faxon and Fortune, have kept their transponders switched off since they set sail, the data showed, making it difficult for most tracking systems to detect their location. 
Those two vessels are also bound for Venezuela, according to the sources, but the route they took is yet unknown.
Two separate sources said earlier this week that the three tankers communicated with the Suez Canal in early September to sail through the waterway, but they did not pass on the scheduled date.

NIAMEY (Reuters) - Nigerien student Hachimou Abdou has had to catch a boat to classes since river water swamped his route to university in the capital Niamey - one of about 760,000 people hit by severe flooding in recent weeks in parts of West and Central Africa.
Floods are common during the rainy season, but in recent years climate change, land degradation and poor urban planning have led to more frequent disasters as rapidly-growing cities struggle with heavier-than-normal rainfall.
Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Congo Republic and Senegal are among those worst-hit this year, with at least 111 people killed, according to latest figures from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
Waters (NYSE:WAT) have yet to recede in parts of Niamey since torrential rains in August caused rivers to burst their banks, destroying nearly 32,000 houses and 5,768 hectares of farmland across Niger.
""I have to get to university - either I take a boat or I walk in the water,"" Abdou said, before settling into a traditional wooden pirogue to travel up the flooded highway. 
Flooding across landlocked Niger alone has so far impacted nearly 333,000 people. Over 188,000 people have been affected in neighbouring Chad, with OCHA warning of potential food shortages due to inundated land.
With further rain expected, particularly in Central Africa, the situation is expected to worsen, said OCHA's director for West and Central Africa, Julie Belanger.
Communities' ability to cope with natural disasters has been eroded by instability, food shortages and mass displacement in some areas. Over 25 million people are in need of humanitarian aid in the violence-plagued Sahel area, which includes Niger, Chad and Mali. 

""Many of those populations live in flood-prone areas. It's just a matter of time for them to be at risk of epidemics,"" Belanger said, describing how quickly diseases can spread once floods wipe out access to clean water and sanitation.

During crisis meetings Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government rebuffed an EU request to scrap his plan to re-write the Brexit divorce accord even after the bloc gave him a three-week ultimatum to do so and threatened legal action. The dispute risks jeopardizing already faltering efforts to secure a trade deal between the two sides by Dec. 31. The pound fell.
“The U.K. has not engaged in a reciprocal way on fundamental EU principles and interests,” EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said in a statement. “Significant differences remain in areas of essential interest for the EU.”
Barnier’s view was backed up by his U.K. counterpart, David Frost, who said in a statement that “a number of challenging areas remain and the divergences on some are still significant.”
Talks will continue, but the bleak picture painted by the two men highlight the increasing chance that the U.K. will fail to reach a trade agreement with the bloc by the end-of-year deadline, when the Brexit transition period concludes. That will trigger tariffs between the U.K. and the world’s biggest single market and snarl commerce with extra paperwork at the border.
Negotiators plan to meet again next week in Brussels, Frost said.
Breaking the Law
Earlier, the bloc gave the U.K. a three-week ultimatum to drop its Internal Market legislation, which would alter commitments made in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its Northern Ireland Protocol. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis admited earlier in the week that it would break international law.
Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove says he told European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic that “we would not be withdrawing this legislation.”
“We have to make sure that the protocol is implemented in a way that respects the fact that Northern Ireland is an integral part” of the U.K., Gove said in a pooled TV interview.
The government also published its legal position, saying its Parliament is sovereign and can pass laws that breach the country’s treaty obligations.
No Progress
After eight rounds of negotiations, the areas of disagreement remain essentially the same, according to Barnier. The U.K is refusing to include guarantees of fair competition, and it hasn’t engaged on issues such as fisheries, judicial cooperation and law enforcement, he said.
In a sign that the talks could break down, Barnier said the bloc is “intensifying its preparedness work to be ready for all scenarios.”
There was no tangible progress on any area during the talks, an EU official said. Asked specifically about fisheries, where a British counterpart said earlier there had been substantial progress, the EU official denied it.
The U.K., for its part, indicated that the EU position on the so-called “level playing field” cuts across British sovereignty, notably on subsidy control.
Parliamentary Battle
Aside from the EU opposition to its legislation, the U.K. government is also bracing for domestic battles. Tory rebels in the House of Commons and wider opposition in the House of Lords are likely to make it tough to get the Internal Market Bill passed as it stands, according to two officials.
Ministers aim to rush the Bill through the Commons in the next two weeks, but in a sign of the opposition the government may face, Michael Howard, a former leader of Johnson’s Conservative Party and a member of the upper chamber, slammed the plan, adding to to rebukes from former Tory Prime Ministers Theresa May and John Major.
“How can we reproach Russia or China or Iran when their conduct falls below internationally accepted standards when we are showing such scant regard for our treaty obligations?” Howard asked in the House of Lords.

The plinth of the World War Two leader's statue on Parliament Square was sprayed in yellow paint with the words ""is a racist"".
""We have arrested a man in Parliament Square on suspicion of causing criminal damage to the Winston Churchill statue,"" the Metropolitan police said on Twitter.
The statue was defaced in June during a fractious end to a mostly peaceful protest over the death of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis, prompting authorities to board it up for a period.

Floyd's death in police custody in May sparked protests about racial inequality across the United States and Europe and reignited a debate in Britain about monuments to those involved in the country's imperialist past.

LAHORE/ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN (Reuters) - Comments by the lead police investigator suggesting that the victim of a gang rape in Pakistan that occurred along one of the country's most secure highways was to blame have spurred cries of outrage.
Investigators say the victim left her home with her two children in Lahore and was driving when her car ran out of fuel around 1:30 a.m. She called a relative and a helpline for the highway police, but before they arrived, two men approached, broke the car’s windows, and dragged the woman and her children to a field beside the highway, where she was gang raped.
Twelve suspects had been arrested so far, Musarrat Cheema, spokesperson for the government of Punjab province, said on Twitter. 
Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a statement on Twitter he was following the case closely and had asked investigators for the ""arrest and sentencing of those involved in the incident as soon as possible,"" adding that his government would look into how to strengthen laws to deal with an apparent increase in cases involving the rape of women and children.
On Thursday, Omar Sheikh, the lead investigator in the case, said in a TV news program that the victim should have taken another highway, the Grand Trunk (GT) Road, and should have made sure she had enough fuel for the journey. The highway the attack took place on was constructed to replace the centuries-old and traffic-plagued GT Road, and is equipped with CCTV and a dedicated police force. Sheikh declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Shireen Mazari, the minister for human rights, said on Twitter that the investigator's remarks were ""unnaceptable."" 
“The right to access public spaces and safe mobility is a fundamental right of every person in Pakistan, including women,” the Women in Law Initiative, a group of women lawyers and rights advocates, said in a statement condemning the attack and pointing out an increasing frequency in similar cases of violence against women and girls. 
In February, lawmakers passed a bill calling for those convicted of the sexual abuse and murder of children to be hanged in public. But the government opposed the bill and it was not enacted into law.

TEOTIHUACAN, Mexico (Reuters) - The massive temples and pyramids of Teotihuacan, one of Mexico's top tourist destinations, reopened to visitors on Thursday, more than five months after closing in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
A trickle of tourists could be seen Thursday morning along the ancient city's main thoroughfare, the so-called Avenue of the Dead, though they were not allowed to scale the site's three tallest pyramids.
The main archeological zone will be limited to 3,000 visitors per day, with both temperature checks and masks required going forward. Two local museums will remain closed.
""I think it's really important for the economy and for tourism that people can keep enjoying places like this,"" said Spanish tourist Matte, one of the first to enter the monument, who declined to give his surname.
The reopening is also welcome news for vendors like Maria de Lourdes Guerra, who has been selling souvenirs at the site for 40 years and said locals were desperate to get back to work.
""People should come back and not forget about us,"" she said.
Mexico has been hard hit by the global coronavirus pandemic, with nearly 650,000 total infections and almost 70,000 deaths confirmed to date by health authorities. Its total caseload is the seventh highest in the world, according to a Reuters tally.
Teotihuacan, located about 30 miles (50 km) northeast of Mexico City, was once the largest city in the Americas. Experts say the metropolis of around 100,000 people grew rich between 100 B.C. to 550 A.D. thanks to a bustling economy that produced crafts including razor-sharp obsidian blades for knives and weapons.

Designated a world heritage site in 1987, Teotihuacan remains shrouded in mystery. Its native language is unknown, as is the city's original name; it was given the name 'Teotihuacan' by the Aztecs some eight centuries after its collapse. In Nahuatl, which is still spoken by several million indigenous Mexicans, Teotihuacan means 'abode of the gods'.

Babis has repeatedly called for a new election in Belarus where protesters have demanded the end of President Alexander Lukashenko's 26-year rule since a disputed election last month, and said the protests needed support.
But in comments to a Czech news agency that he also sent to Reuters, Babis rejected the proposal of a meeting by Poland, which chairs the Visegrad Group that also includes Hungary and Slovakia. All four nations are members of the European Union.
""I do not want to make a hasty step that will not be in line with the pan-European position, will give ammunition to Belarusian propaganda and will in the end be counter-productive,"" CTK quoted Babis as saying.
Exiled leader Tsikhanouskaya was visiting Poland this week and attended a Polish economic forum and multiple events with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Warsaw on Wednesday. 
Babis said the proposal by Poland only came in the ""last hours"". He reiterated his support for free elections in Belarus.
Polish officials told Reuters that Friday's Visegrad Group summit would nonetheless largely focus on Belarus, with the aim of coordinating a common position putting pressure on the European Union to do more for the country. 
A spokesman for the Polish government said only that the pre-agreed agenda did not include a meeting with Tsikhanouskaya.
At loggerheads with Brussels over Poland's adherence to rule of law standards, Morawiecki's Law and Justice government is keen to burnish its regional credentials. 
Lukashenko denies rigging the Aug. 9 election, which official results said he won by a landslide, and has cracked down hard on protesters demanding his resignation.

The European Union aims to impose economic sanctions on 31 senior Belarusian officials, Reuters has reported. But a dispute in the eastern Mediterranean has delayed EU sanctions on Belarus over the Aug. 9 election that Western powers say was rigged.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian resident doctors on Thursday suspended a strike to allow the government time to meet its demands over pay and working conditions amid the spread of the coronavirus, the head of the doctors' union said.
The National Association of Resident Doctors resolved to suspend the strike ""to give government time to address our demands,"" said Aliyu Sokomba, president of the union, in a WhatsApp message to Reuters.
The strike began on Monday, and included 16,000 resident doctors out of a total of 42,000 doctors in the country, including those who worked in COVID-19 treatment centres, he had said earlier this week.
Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has more than 55,000 confirmed coronavirus infections and more than 1,000 deaths.
Resident doctors are medical school graduates training as specialists. They are pivotal to frontline healthcare in Nigeria as they dominate the emergency wards in its hospitals.
The union last went on strike in June, demanding better benefits and more protective equipment for battling coronavirus. They are still demanding, among other things, life insurance and hazard allowances.
A labour ministry statement earlier this week said the government had spent 20 billion naira ($52.53 million) on hazard allowances for healthcare workers in April, May and June, and had met the bulk of the doctors' demands.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday delayed the scheduled trial of two Manhattan jail guards charged with covering up their failure to monitor Jeffrey Epstein on the night he killed himself.
Tova Noel and Michael Thomas now face a June 14, 2021 trial date, five months later than previously planned, after pleading not guilty last November to falsely certifying they conducted inmate counts during Epstein's final hours.
At a hearing, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan said a delay would give the defendants and prosecutors more time to discuss a ""possible disposition"" of the case, which could involve pleas, and ensure a courtroom would be available.
The Manhattan federal court has a backlog of trials because of the coronavirus pandemic, and plans to schedule cases that are older or involve incarcerated defendants sooner.
Noel and Thomas are free on bail.
""The government has represented that they will not be dismissing the case and Ms. Noel has no plans to enter a guilty plea,"" Noel's lawyer Jason Foy said in an email after the hearing.
A lawyer for Thomas did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Epstein, the financier and registered sex offender, died at age 66 on Aug. 10, 2019. He was found hanging in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Manhattan.
Authorities had charged Epstein with trafficking in dozens of women and underage girls. Some alleged victims have said his abuses dated back to the 1980s.
Prosecutors have said that in the hours before Epstein's death, Noel shopped online for furniture, Thomas surfed the internet for sports news and motorcycle sales, and both appeared to have fallen asleep for about two hours.
Epstein's death angered U.S. Attorney General William Barr, and prompted a management overhaul at the Manhattan jail.

The case is U.S. v. Noel et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-cr-00830.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said it arrested four men who used a low-flying helicopter to avoid detection of the illegal transport of cannabis from Canada into the U.S.
Law enforcement officials seized the Jet Ranger helicopter used by the men, following a 16-month investigation conducted jointly with U.S. Homeland Security Investigations into the illegal import of guns and cannabis, the RCMP said on Wednesday.
The law enforcement partners executed six search warrants and seized over 800 plants and dried cannabis and around 400 grams of cocaine, as well as illegal handguns in an operation conducted with the assistance of the Ontario Provincial Police, the RCMP said. The searches were conducted in the Greater Toronto area and Quebec, the RCMP said.
While Canada legalized cannabis for recreational use in 2018, marijuana is illegal in the U.S. under federal law, although several U.S. states allow its use. It is illegal to leave Canada with cannabis, and its growth in Canada is regulated.
The four men, all residents of Ontario, were charged with violations of the Criminal Code of Canada including conspiracy to commit the unlawful export of cannabis, possession of cannabis for the purpose of exporting it and cultivating cannabis not at a dwelling house, the RCMP said.

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union told Britain on Thursday it should urgently scrap a plan to break their divorce treaty, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government refused and pressed ahead with a draft law that could sink four years of Brexit talks.
The European Commission said it was stepping up preparations for a messy end to Britain's departure from the EU, and that London would be committing ""an extremely serious violation"" of last year's Withdrawal Agreement if it went ahead with proposed legislation.
After emergency talks between Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic and Britain's Brexit supremo Michael Gove, the EU said Britain's proposal had ""seriously damaged trust"" which London must now take steps to re-establish.
Gove, one of Johnson's most senior ministers, said he refused the EU's request to scrap the draft legislation.
""I explained to Vice President Sefcovic that we could not and would not do that,"" Gove said.
EU diplomats and officials said the bloc could take legal action against Britain, though there would be no resolution before the end-of-year deadline for Britain's full exit.
Britain signed the treaty and formally left the EU in January after more than three years of crises and wrangling over Brexit. But it is a member in everything but name until the end of the year when a transition agreement expires.
The British government says it is committed to the treaty and that a proposed law overriding parts of the Withdrawal Agreement merely clarifies ambiguities. Its main priority, it says, is the 1998 Northern Irish peace deal that ended decades of violence.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told his British counterpart Dominic Raab a violation of the Withdrawal Agreement with the EU would be ""unacceptable"", a spokeswoman said. 
Europe's leaders have been handed an ultimatum: accept the treaty breach or prepare for a messy divorce that could sow chaos through supply chains across Europe and spook global financial markets. 
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro and the FTSE 100 share index fell. European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said she was monitoring Brexit developments.
The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier, in London for separate scheduled talks on an overarching future relationship deal, criticised the British approach to negotiations and said significant differences remained.
""The UK has not engaged in a reciprocal way on fundamental EU principles and interests,"" he said in a statement.
""The EU is intensifying its preparedness work to be ready for all scenarios on 1 January 2021.""
Britain's negotiator David Frost said there would be further talks in Brussels next week and he would keep working on a deal.
""A number of challenging areas remain and the divergences on some are still significant,"" Frost said in a statement.
BREXIT ULTIMATUM
European diplomats said Britain was playing a game of Brexit ""chicken"", threatening to wreck the process and challenging Brussels to change course. Some fear Johnson views a no-deal exit as a useful distraction from the coronavirus pandemic.
One EU source said Britain would not succeed if it tried to use the planned breach of the Withdrawal Agreement as a threat to extract concessions from the bloc in trade talks.
""If they try to do that, it will fail,"" the EU source said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it expected ""the perceived probability of a breakdown in negotiations to escalate over the coming weeks"" but its base case remains a ""thin"" free trade agreement that steers both sides back from the brink.
Without a trade agreement, nearly $1 trillion in trade between the EU and Britain could be thrown into confusion at the start of 2021, compounding the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
But Britain is pressing one of the EU's most sensitive buttons -- fear that a post-Brexit Britain could become a much more deregulated free-market competitor with access to EU markets by using selective state aid.
The latest dispute centres on rules for Northern Ireland, which shares a land border with EU member Ireland, because under the divorce deal it remains within the EU's orbit -- a restriction Britain wants to remove.
Former British leaders Theresa May and John Major scolded Johnson for considering an intentional breach of international law.
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Britain would not get a trade deal with the United States if it did anything to undermine the 1998 Northern Irish peace deal.
""This news comes to us ... that the UK had decided to undermine the Good Friday Accords. What were they thinking?"" she told reporters in Washington. 

""Whatever it is, I hope they're not thinking of a UK-U.S. bilateral trade agreement to make up for what they might lose.""

880,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 02:27PM ET</span>",Eight dead in Colombian protests against police brutality,"By Luis Jaime Acosta and Julia Symmes Cobb
BOGOTA (Reuters) - Eight people were killed in Colombian capital Bogota and satellite city Soacha overnight in protests against police brutality, sparked by a widely-shared video of a man being repeatedly shocked with a stun gun by police before later dying.
Nearly 100 police officers and 55 civilians were injured and dozens of stations and public vehicles damaged or set alight, the national government said. There were 70 arrests, mostly in Bogota.
Bogota's mayor Claudia Lopez asked President Ivan Duque to call a halt to police use of firearms at protests.
""There is solid evidence of indiscriminate use of guns by members of the police,"" Lopez told journalists at a local hospital. ""We will not tolerate the use of violence to suppress violence.""
Six people were killed during the protests in Bogota, she said, adding that all of them were young people who had gunshot injuries.
The defense minister said earlier on Thursday all the deaths, including that of a 17-year-old boy, were still under investigation.
Lopez urged protesters to refrain from vandalism.
The demonstrators were protesting the death this week of law student and father of two Javier Ordonez, 46.
The video, filmed by Ordonez's friend, shows him pinned to the ground by police officers and subjected to successive electric shocks as he begs, ""please, no more."" 
Police say Ordonez was found drinking alcohol in the street with friends, in violation of coronavirus distancing rules. He was taken to a police station in western Bogota where his family allege he suffered further abuse. He died later in hospital.
The two officers involved have been suspended pending an investigation, the government has said.
Ordonez's family called for justice and peaceful protest.
""He was murdered by the police officers,"" his former sister-in-law, Eliana Marcela Garzon, told Reuters. ""We don't want (deaths) in a country already full of conflict, we want justice."" 
Police reform is needed, Garzon said, especially for the future of children like her now-fatherless nephews.
""I don't want them to grow up feeling like there isn't justice in this country,"" she said. ""I want them to grow up knowing laws are followed.""
Duque has said abuse of authority should not be tolerated, but the government called for Colombians not to ""stigmatize"" police officers and appealed for calm.
""What we are facing here is a mass act of vandalism and violence,"" defense minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo told journalists. ""What we are facing are unacceptable actions.""
Bogota's police will be reinforced with 1,600 more officers, more than half of whom will come from other regions, and 300 soldiers, the defense ministry said.
An effort by labor unions earlier this week to revive mass protests seen last year against Duque's economic and social policies garnered a tepid response amid ongoing coronavirus restrictions.

But Ordonez's death could fuel renewed widespread outrage against the police, who were roundly criticized last year after a teenage protester was fatally injured by a riot squad projectile.

""There's people suggesting that perhaps there will be a rollout of a new weapon system. Maybe, but we're not seeing any indications right now of any sort of lashing out,"" General Robert Abrams said during an event hosted by Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. 
A CSIS report on Friday said satellite imagery of a North Korean shipyard showed activity suggestive of preparations for a test of a medium-range submarine-launched ballistic missile.
News of the activity at the Sinpo shipyard comes amid signs that North Korea may be preparing for a major military parade in October, which some analysts believe could be used to show off new missiles, as the country has done at such events in the past.
U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking re-election on Nov. 3 and a missile test or such a display by North Korea before that would highlight the lack of progress in his unprecedented engagement with the country, which included meetings with its leader Kim Jong Un in 2018 and 2019.
Earlier on Thursday, Trump, without providing any context, wrote on Twitter: ""Kim Jong Un is in good health. Never underestimate him!""
Trump's tweet came a day after the release of excerpts of letters between Kim and Trump in a new book by Washington Post associate editor Bob  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD), in which the North Korean leader addresses the U.S. leader as ""excellency"" and two exchanged other expressions of flattery. 

There was widespread speculation this year about Kim's health when he disappeared from public view for much of April. Trump welcomed Kim's public reappearance in May and has continued to refer to him as a friend.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's foreign ministry said on Thursday it regrets England's decision to reimpose a quarantine regime for travellers from mainland Portugal, which has hit the tourism-dependent country hard.
""We regret the British decision to exclude mainland Portugal from the list of countries exempt from quarantine,"" the foreign ministry said on Twitter. ""But we value they kept Azores and Madeira.""
Anybody arriving in England from Portugal, excluding the Azores and Madeira, after 4 a.m. on Saturday will need to self-isolate for 14 days, British Transport Minister Grant Shapps announced earlier on Thursday.
Portugal only spent three weeks off England's self-quarantine isolation rule but a worrying rise in coronavirus cases in the southern European nation forced authorities to reimpose it. 
Also on Twitter, Portugal's foreign ministry said the country's ""health rules and the effectiveness of our national health service have allowed us to control the effects of the pandemic"". 
Portugal, which has reported 62,126 cases so far, initially won praise for its response to the pandemic but cases have crept back up, with the health authority reporting on Thursday 585 new infections, mainly in Greater Lisbon and the northern region.
From Sept. 15, the whole country will be put under a state of contingency, meaning gatherings will be limited to 10 people and commercial establishments must close between 8 and 11 p.m.
The tourism industry in Portugal's southern Algarve region, a popular destination among British visitors, has been badly hit by the quarantine rule, and many businesses there are struggling to make ends meet. 

Joao Fernandes, head of the Algarve's tourism authority, told SIC Television, England's decision ""will have a considerable impact"" on the region but said it was already expected.

MAPUTO (Reuters) - Mozambique on Thursday denied accusations by rights group Amnesty International that soldiers had committed atrocities, saying the acts were carried out by Islamist insurgents impersonating troops.
Militants with links to Islamic State have stepped up attacks in Mozambique this year, alarming governments across southern Africa.
Amnesty said on Wednesday it had seen videos showing soldiers in the uniforms of the Mozambique Armed Defence Forces and the Mozambique Rapid Intervention Police committing atrocities against alleged fighters in the northernmost province of Cabo Delgado. 
""The videos and pictures show the attempted beheading, torture and other ill-treatment of prisoners; the dismemberment of alleged opposition fighters; possible extrajudicial executions; and the transport and discarding of a large number of corpses into apparent mass graves,"" Amnesty said.
Mozambique's defence ministry on Thursday dismissed the report, saying militants regularly impersonated soldiers.
""One of the tactics used by terrorists in their macabre incursions against the population is to pretend to be elements of the FDS (Defense and Security Forces) in a veiled attempt to confuse national and international public opinion,"" said ministry spokesman Colonel Omar Nala Saranga.
""The Defense and Security Forces reiterate that they do not agree with any form of torture, beheading attempts, mistreatment or illegal acts,"" he added in a statement.
Militant attacks began in Cabo Delgado in 2017, and have rapidly gathered pace this year with insurgents seizing key towns for brief periods and hitting military and other key targets.
The violence has alarmed energy majors exploring huge natural gas deposits there.

The EU military mission, named Irini, is operating in the Mediterranean to stop arms from reach warring factions in Libya.
The mission said in a statement that a German frigate, supported by an Italian frigate, stopped the merchant vessel Royal Diamond 7 just after dawn in international waters, 150 km (95 miles) north of the Libyan city of Derna.

""His decision didn't surprise me. Why? Because I know he is upholding the higher national interest"", Harry Roque said in a regular news briefing when asked to give his ""personal take"" on the president's move. 
Duterte on Monday pardoned Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton who was serving a six- to 10-year sentence for killing Jennifer Laude near a former U.S. navy base in 2014, sparking condemnation from activists who described the move as a ""mockery of justice"". 
Roque, who served as lawyer in the prosecution of Pemberton, had likened Laude's killing to the ""death of Philippine sovereignty"".
""I think this pardon, although this is my personal opinion, was to ensure Filipinos would benefit from a vaccine against COVID-19 should the Americans develop one,"" Roque said. ""I don't see any problem with that"".

Authorities are on high alert for any fresh outbreaks, as most schools across Canada resume classes after being shut for more then six months. Alberta on Wednesday reported 16 coronavirus cases across as many schools, though most of the infections were acquired elsewhere.

889,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Trump administration considers postponing refugee admissions, U.S. official says","By Ted Hesson and Mica Rosenberg
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials are weighing whether to postpone or further cut refugee admissions in the coming year amid legal fights over President Donald Trump's refugee policy and uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a senior official said.
The possible postponement - one of several options under discussion - would mean some or all refugee admissions could be frozen until a legal challenge to a 2019 Trump order on refugees is resolved ""with some greater degree of finality,"" the official told Reuters. 
It is not clear when that lawsuit may be resolved, especially if the case goes all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, a process that could take months or even longer. 
The president typically sets yearly refugee levels around the beginning of each fiscal year and the Trump administration has not yet announced its plans for fiscal 2021, which begins on Oct. 1. 
The refugee cap was cut to 18,000 this year, the lowest level since the modern-day program began in 1980. So far, roughly half that many refugees have been let in as increased vetting and the coronavirus pandemic have slowed arrivals. 
The senior official said that even if 2021 admissions are not delayed, next year's cap could be cut below current levels.
""The arc of this administration's refugee policy is going to continue,"" said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss the ongoing deliberations.
Trump and his top officials have said refugees could pose threats to national security and that resettlement should take place closer to countries of origin. The administration also contends that refugee resettlement can be costly for local communities, although refugee backers reject those arguments.
The possible moves remain under discussion and no final decision has been reached, the official stressed. 
Democratic challenger Joe Biden has pledged to raise refugee admissions to 125,000 per year if he defeats Trump in November. However, Biden has not said how quickly he would raise the cap and advocates say the program could take years to recover after Trump-era reductions.
If he wins, Biden could seek to raise the cap soon after taking office, just as Trump moved to halve refugee admissions in early 2017. But refugee groups say that restoring the pipeline of travel-ready refugees and rebuilding the organizations that receive them in the United States will take months or years as refugees will need to undergo renewed security and medical checks and shuttered resettlement offices will need to reopen.
Trump, who is seeking another four-year term on Nov. 3, has made his immigration crackdown a focus of the presidency and 2020 campaign. 

In addition to greatly reducing refugee admissions to the United States, Trump also issued an executive order in September 2019 that required state and local elected officials to consent to receive refugees, saying it would better ensure refugees were sent to areas with adequate resources to receive them. 
In January, a Maryland-based U.S. district judge blocked the order from taking effect, prompting Trump administration officials to consider a possible ""deferral"" of refugee admissions until the court case is resolved, the senior official said. 
The administration's refugee cap discussions involve officials from the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon, and have been coordinated by the White House National Security Council, according to the senior official, who declined to provide the names of those involved.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A U.S. auction house has stopped the sale of a 16th-century manuscript linked to the Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes after researchers said it was probably stolen from the national archives of Mexico.
The document, dating back to 1521, was a royal order to Cortes, the leader of a Spanish force that colonized what is modern-day Mexico, and Pedro de Alvarado, whom the text identifies as the mayor of the town hall of Tenochtitlán, the capital of the Aztec empire.
New York art house Swann Auction Galleries had advertised the document's sale on its website with a price range between $20,000 to $30,000 for a planned Sept. 24 auction.
The manuscript was a ""contemporary scribal transcript of the Cortes-signed original which resides in the Archivo General de Indias in Seville,"" Swann Auction Galleries said earlier this week.
But on Wednesday the auction house told Reuters that the gallery ""will be withdrawing this lot from the auction."" It did not say if the manuscript would be returned to Mexico.
The gallery's announcement came days after three Mexican researchers and a colleague from the University of Valladolid in Spain raised concerns about the provenance of the manuscript and alerted Mexican authorities in a bid to stop the sale.
The researchers said the image of the manuscript on the Swann website was similar to another taken in 2010 by a Spanish scholar of Cortes when the document was in Mexico's General Archive of the Nation.
The manuscript was held in an area of the archive that houses some of the oldest documents preserved in the American continent, many by the hand of (Cortes). 
Carlos Ruiz, director general of the archive, this week said looting from the institution had been ""monumental."" 
Michel Oujdik, one of the Mexican researchers who alerted the authorities, said they must investigate and ""close the door on this kind of document theft.""

892,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 12:11PM ET</span>",Belarus protest leader says she was threatened with expulsion 'alive or in bits',"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Belarus opposition politician Maria Kolesnikova said security officers put a bag over her head and threatened to kill her when they tried to forcibly deport her to Ukraine earlier this week, according to a complaint filed by her lawyer on Thursday.
Kolesnikova, one of the most prominent leaders of month-old protests against the re-election of President Alexander Lukashenko, prevented the attempt to expel her by tearing up her passport.
She has emerged as a hero for the protest movement trying to bring down the curtain on Lukashenko's 26-year rule, and a chief target for the authorities who have detained her over accusations of an illegal attempt to seize power in the former Soviet republic.
She said in her statement that she had genuinely feared for her life during the failed deportation attempt.
""In particular it was stated that if I did not voluntarily leave the Republic of Belarus, I would be taken out anyway, alive or in bits. There were also threats to imprison me for up to 25 years,"" Kolesnikova said.
She was told there would be ""problems"" for her while she was held under guard or in jail.
""The persons indicated (security officers) uttered threats to my life and health, which I took to be real,"" she said. 
Her lawyer Lyudmila Kazak filed a criminal complaint against Belarusian authorities including the KGB security police, for kidnap, illegal detention and threats to commit murder, the news portal Tut.By said.
The complaint was submitted to the state Investigative Committee. Asked for comment, a representative of the Committee, Sergei Kabakovich, said: ""At the present moment I have no information about this.""
NAMES AND RANKS
Kolesnikova's complaint included the names and ranks of individual officers of the KGB and the organised crime agency whom she accuses of threatening her, and said she would be able to identify them.
She is now being held in the capital Minsk, where Kazak said she was being questioned on Thursday. Kazak saw her client at a pretrial detention centre on Wednesday, and said she had bruises on her body.
Lukashenko denies rigging the Aug. 9 election, which official results said he won by a landslide, and has cracked down hard on protesters demanding his resignation. He has refused to talk to the opposition, saying it is bent on wrecking the country.
Inaugurating a new chief prosecutor on Thursday, Lukashenko reiterated his uncompromising line.
""Power is not given to be taken, thrown and given away,"" he said, adding that the country must not return to the chaos of the 1990s following the break-up of the Soviet Union.
He told prosecutors to act more decisively against opposition networks, many using Telegram instant messaging channels to organise demonstrations, which he acknowledged had spread widely through workplaces.
""There is an attempt to seize power,"" he said. ""You must adopt a more powerful, sharper prosecutorial response to such actions.""
In the month since the disputed election, nearly all the opposition's key leaders have been arrested, fled, or been forced to leave the country. The rights group Vesna (Spring) published a list of 58 people it described as political prisoners, with details of their arrests.
Writer Svetlana Alexievich, winner of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature, accused the authorities on Wednesday of terrorising their own people. Diplomats from seven European countries came to her flat, in part to try to protect her.
Lukashenko, in power since 1994, retains the support of his key ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin. The West has so far been cautious about taking firm action that might provoke a Russian intervention, although the EU is drawing up a list of Belarusian officials to target with sanctions. 

Anton Rodnenkov, an opposition member who was expelled to Ukraine this week, was quoted by RIA news agency as saying: ""Lukashenko will resign... If this happens in October or November this year, we would be pleased.""

France is leaning on Lebanon's fractious politicians to establish a new government that will enact reforms to dig the country out of a crippling economic crisis seen as the biggest threat to stability since its 1975-1990 civil war.
President Emmanuel Macron said on Sept. 1, during a visit to Beirut, that Lebanese leaders had agreed to form a cabinet within two weeks, meaning one should be in place by early next week, to start implementing reforms set out in a French roadmap.
It typically takes months to form governments in Lebanon, which is riven by sectarian and factional politics.
""We are all hoping that will be possible"" to meet the deadline, a diplomat told Reuters.
But ""there has always been scepticism, in both political and diplomatic circles, that it could be delivered in two weeks, and there is still clearly a lot of work to be done before we have a full list of names,"" the diplomat added. 
During his visit to Paris, Lebanese Major General Abbas Ibrahim met the French team tasked with following up on the French initiative, the Lebanese official said. 
On returning to Beirut, the official said Ibrahim relayed to President Michel Aoun ""France's interest in following up on what was agreed during Macron's visit, especially with regards to speeding up formation of the government.""
Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib, named under French pressure on the eve of Macron's visit, met Aoun on Tuesday and said he was in ""the phase of consultation"" with Lebanon's president.

During his visit, Macron gave Lebanese politicians until the end of October to start delivering on reforms, saying financial aid would be withheld and sanctions imposed further down the line if corruption gets in the way.

Egypt last held elections for the House of Representatives in 2015. The chamber is dominated by supporters of President Abel-Fattah al-Sisi, who took power in 2013 after the army removed Islamist President Mohamed Mursi following mass protests against his rule.
In 2018 Sisi was re-elected with 97% of votes, the same proportion that the former military commander secured four years ago for his first term but with a lower turnout.
In August, Egypt held elections for a newly created Senate, an advisory body. Voter turnout came to only 14.23%, which commentators attributed to the coronavirus pandemic, a lack of awareness about the new chamber, and voter apathy.
In April 2019, voters in a referendum approved constitutional changes in a move that could pave the way for Sisi to stay in power until 2030, official data showed.

Ibrahim said that in next month's vote, Egyptians abroad would be able to vote on Oct. 21-23.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Half of Americans believe media reports that President Donald Trump referred to U.S. soldiers as ""suckers"" and ""losers,"" despite his denials, but the alleged comments do not appear to have hurt his standing among Republicans, a Reuters/Ipsos poll shows. 
The national public opinion poll, released Thursday, found that 50% of U.S. adults said they found the reports to be credible, while 37% said they did not and 13% said they were not sure. 
Yet most Republicans still hold favorable views of Trump, and a majority of Republicans say the recent news has not influenced their choice for president. 
Trump has denounced multiple news reports that he repeatedly disparaged American servicemen, including a report in The Atlantic magazine that he had once called dead U.S. marines ""suckers"" for getting killed, and that a cemetery of fallen American servicemen in Europe was filled with ""losers."" 
The poll shows that while public disapproval of Trump has increased slightly over the past week, it is mostly unchanged among Republicans. 
Republicans have unflinchingly backed Trump since before he won the White House, with little variation in their approval of him during events including his impeachment in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
The poll, conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday, showed 58% of Republicans or Republican-leaning independents said Trump's alleged comments have had no impact on their decision to vote for him. Another 18% said they were now more likely to vote for Trump and 14% said they were less so. The remaining 10% said they are not sure. 
The poll also showed that 85% of Republicans have a favorable impression of Trump, about the same as last week, and 84% said they would vote for his re-election while 8% would back Biden.
Among all likely voters, Trump trails Biden nationally by 12 percentage points.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,004 American adults, including 855 registered voters. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points.

Rieli Franciscato, 56, had spent his career as an official in the government's indigenous affairs agency Funai, working to set up reservations that protect uncontacted tribes.
On Wednesday, as he moved close to a hitherto uncontacted indigenous group, he was hit by an arrow above the heart in the forest near the Uru Eu Wau Wau reservation in the western Brazilian state of Rondonia near the border with Bolivia.
""He cried out, pulled the arrow from his chest, ran 50 meters and collapsed, lifeless,"" a policeman who accompanied the expedition said in an audio posted on social media.
The Kanindé ethno-environmental defense NGO he helped found in the 1980s said the indigenous group had no ability to distinguish between a friend or a foe from the outside world.
His death comes at a time when indigenous people in Brazil are under increasing threat from invasions by illegal land grabbers, loggers and gold miners, emboldened by the policies of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro who wants to develop the Amazon and reduce the size of indigenous reservations.

KABUL (Reuters) - Six prisoners sought by the Taliban left Kabul on a flight to Doha on Thursday evening, paving the way for long-awaited peace talks to begin, two government sources told Reuters.
The prisoners, who are accused of insider attacks on Afghan forces and whose release was objected to by some Western powers, are to be kept under supervision in Qatar's capital where United States-brokered peace talks will also initially take place.
""The six will remain in Qatar until the end of November and could be transferred back to Kabul,"" one of the sources told Reuters. 
Three government and one diplomatic source said the Afghan government negotiating team as well as peace council chairman Abdullah Abdullah were planning to fly to Doha on Friday and talks were expected to begin this weekend after months of delays.
The United States and other international players have been trying to usher the insurgent Taliban and the Afghan government to the negotiating table to bring an end to 19 years of war.
However, there have been deadlocks and delays since Washington signed its troop withdrawal pact with the insurgent group in February that stated ""up to"" 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 government prisoners would be released before talks.
The militant group have insisted that its own list of 5,000 be released, including six objected to by Western governments such as France and Australia for insider attacks on their forces.
The government source told Reuters the opening ceremony for negotiations was planned for Saturday followed by technical discussions on the agenda for talks. 
Diplomats and analysts have cautioned in recent weeks that among the first challenging steps would be to agree to a ceasefire after violence in the war-torn nation has grown sharply in recent months, leading to deepening mistrust between the two sides.

Military officials from the two countries, both NATO members, were due to hold talks in Brussels on Tuesday after an initial contact last week, but NATO postponed the talks.
The ""military de-confliction"" talks, announced by Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg last week, aim to prevent an escalation from incidents such as a collision between Turkish and Greek warships last month.
The warships had been shadowing a Turkish vessel surveying for oil and gas in disputed Mediterranean waters west of Cyprus, an operation that Greece condemned as illegal. Ankara and Athens both view the area as part of their continental shelf.
Greece says any discussion is contingent on the departure of Turkish vessels from disputed waters, but Turkey says it will not engage in talks under pre-conditions. 
The technical talks at NATO will not address underlying territorial disputes, but could discuss establishing a hotline between the two militaries. 
""Turkey continues to support efforts for the resolution of the issue through dialogue and without any pre-conditions,"" the security source said, adding talks started at 1230 GMT and were underway in Brussels.
Greece has also been calling for EU sanctions on Turkey. On Thursday, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the bloc must impose ""meaningful"" sanctions on Turkey unless it pulls its vessels from the area. He said Turkey and Greece needed dialogue ""but not when held at gunpoint"".

BERLIN/HAMBURG (Reuters) - Germany confirmed on Thursday that African swine fever (ASF) had been found in a dead wild boar near its Polish border, threatening pork exports to China from Europe's biggest pork producer worth $1.2 billion last year.
Authorities in the German state of Brandenburg quarantined a 15 km area around where the boar was found to search for any more dead animals and also restricted the movement of farm animals. 
South Korea, Germany's second largest pigmeat customer outside the European Union, moved quickly to announce a ban on German pork imports.
While the disease is not dangerous to humans it is fatal to pigs and a massive outbreak in China, the world's biggest pork producer, has led to hundreds of millions of pigs being culled. 
Major pork importers such as China often impose bans on imports of pigmeat from countries where ASF has been found, even if only in wild animals.
""The attention is now on whether exporting countries, especially China, impose import restrictions on German pigmeat,"" said Andre Schaefer at commodity brokerage Kaackterminhandel GmbH. 
""China especially is a vital customer for Germany. If import bans are imposed we could see pork prices under pressure in Germany,"" he said.
In the first four months of 2020, Germany exported 158,000 tonnes of pork worth 424 million euros ($500 million) to China, double the amount in the same period last year, the country's statistics office said.
DON'T PANIC 
Agriculture minister Julia Kloeckner said Berlin had been in contact overnight with China. Germany does not have a formal agreement with China about the disease, ""so therefore we are in permanent dialogue"".
Germany is stressing ""the principle of regionality"" in the case, she said. Regionality means that buyers only impose import restrictions on parts of a country which has been hit by a serious animal disease, she said.
Germany has built hundreds of kilometres of fencing along the Polish border in an attempt to stop the disease being spread by wild boar. 
Berlin has been concerned ASF could enter the country after a number of cases were confirmed in recent months in wild boars in western Poland, with one only about 10 km from the frontier.
Cases have also been confirmed recently in about 10 other European countries, where wild boars are suspected of spreading the disease.
Kloeckner said she expected German pigmeat exports to other European countries to continue.
The case is ""no reason to panic"", Kloeckner said, adding that the authorities were intensively assessing what measures needed to be taken to combat the disease and prevent it spreading to commercial pig farms.
""It is a case in one wild boar in one area,"" she said.

The German farmers' association DBV on Thursday called for a corridor free of wild boar to be created along Germany's border with Poland.

A strong showing by his Christian Democrats (CDU) would boost Laschet's prospects as the race to succeed Merkel heats up and the party looks ahead to a congress in December at which it must choose a new leader.
The new CDU chairman will be in pole position to be the party's chancellor candidate, though in theory the leader of its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), could run as the candidate for their alliance, dubbed ""the Union"".
Merkel, in power since 2005, has said she will not seek re-election in federal elections due by October next year.
More than 14 million people are entitled to vote on Sunday in Germany's most populous state - elections that will show how Laschet has emerged from a difficult summer.
After pushing for an easing of lockdown restrictions in April, he put the Guetersloh area back into lockdown in June after a coronavirus outbreak at a meatpacking plant. Polls showed voters rated his crisis management skills poorly.
The CDU appears to have endured the episode in North Rhine-Westphalia. An infratest dimap poll for broadcaster WDR last week showed the party leading rivals with 34% support, ahead of the Greens on 22% and the Social Democrats on 21%.
Laschet, a centrist, has sought to broaden his national appeal by teaming up with Health Minister Jens Spahn, who appeals to some on the CDU's more conservative wing.

But polls suggest German voters would prefer CSU leader Markus Soeder to be the Union's chancellor candidate. No chancellor has ever come from the CSU.

Suu Kyi, a former political prisoner of Myanmar's then ruling military junta in the 1990s who now rules as state counselor, was awarded the parliament's Sakharov Prize in 1990. 
As part of that honor, she is also invited to gatherings of prize laureates, EU lawmakers and rights organizations to campaign on rights issues internationally.
EU lawmakers said in a statement that her suspension from Sakharov Prize events was ""a response to her failure to act and her acceptance of the ongoing crimes against the Rohingya community in Myanmar"".
Suu Kyi, who came to power after a landslide election victory in 2015 that ended half a century of army rule, is accused internationally of failing to denounce a military campaign against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.
Her stance on the Rohingyas has seen her stripped of other awards, calls for the Nobel committee to revoke the Nobel Peace Prize that she won in 1991 and criticism from former supporters.
Suu Kyi denies genocide and has defended her country against the charges in the U.N. court in The Hague.
The EU parliament said she was not stripped of the prize or asked to return the 50,000 euro ($59,000) prize money because the award was for her pro-democracy role in opposition at the time, when she was repeatedly imprisoned and placed under house arrest until her release in 2010.

""In Yemeni society, people fear for girls,"" she said. ""Many come to train to learn self-defense, others train for fitness.""
Amer set up the gym to empower women and girls in the city in 2015, a year after the Iran-aligned Houthi group took over Sanaa and most of north Yemen after ousting the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. 
The Houthis are now engaged in a running battle with a Saudi-led coalition - a war that has killed more than 100,000 people across Yemen and reduced large parts of the capital to rubble.
But the classes have kept going through the fighting, and through the restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus. 
Parts of the program have even expanded, said Amer, who has won gold and silver medals in international kickboxing competitions, and prizes and certificates in other martial arts.

In a statement on Thursday, police said they were also banning the ""Yellow Vests"" from gathering in parts of the capital such as the Champs-Elysees, the parliament building and Notre-Dame Cathedral.
Protesters have been circulating messages on social media, urging people to assemble in Paris this Saturday for a demonstration, even though there are bans on mass gatherings as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The protests, named after the yellow high visibility jackets French drivers have to keep in their cars and which have been worn by demonstrators, began in November 2018 after public anger against fuel tax rises.
Those taxes were subsequently scrapped but the movement has lingered on and morphed into a broader anti-government protest.

A ""Yellow Vests"" demonstration on Dec. 1, 2018, resulted in some of the worst unrest Paris had witnessed in decades.

PARIS (Reuters) - The French government will discuss on Friday whether to impose new, local lockdowns to try to tackle rising COVID-19 while keeping economic and social activities going.
Government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on Thursday that nothing would be ruled out at Friday's cabinet meeting, while President Emmanuel Macron said he hoped any new measures would not be too restrictive.
Macron said that while he would not want to pre-empt any decisions, he hoped current rules would allow France to tackle the virus and let people live as normally as possible.
He was referring to measures such as social distancing and the compulsory wearing of face-masks in much of France. 
""We need to do it while allowing us to continue to live, such as being able to educate our children, treat other illnesses and protect other patients,"" Macron told a news conference in Corsica.

The country reported 8,577 new confirmed COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, the second-highest number of daily additional infections since the disease started to spread in the country at the end of the winter.
Professor Jean-François Delfraissy, who heads the scientific council that advises the government on the epidemic, said the spread of the virus was being closely monitored in big cities such as Paris and Marseille.

""We must do everything we can to avoid local lockdowns ... In these regions we could look into further restrictions of big gatherings of crowds,"" he told RTL radio.

The women carried a large banner reading ""Can't bare the truth?"" and had words painted on their chests representing predicted consequences of global warming such as war, drought, starvation, wildfires, violence and famine.
Some of the women used metal D-locks normally used to lock up bicycles to attach themselves by the neck to the parliamentary estate's railings.
The women called on the government to inform the public about the risks of allowing average global temperatures to rise by 4 degrees centigrade, which Extinction Rebellion says is what will happen by 2100 unless countries take action now.
The activist group restarted its protests in Britain last week following a long lull due to the coronavirus pandemic. On Saturday, Extinction Rebellion protesters blockaded two printworks to disrupt the distribution of newspapers the group accuses of failing to accurately report on climate issues.
On Tuesday, Home Secretary (interior minister) Priti Patel described the group as eco-crusaders turned criminals whose ""guerilla tactics"" must be stopped.

""I refuse point-blank to allow that kind of anarchy on our streets,"" she said of the printworks protest.

909,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 07:26AM ET</span>",A migrant mother saw her disabled son walk into the U.S. Then he disappeared,"By Mimi Dwyer, Kristina Cooke and Sofia Menchu
LOS ANGELES/PETEN, Guatemala (Reuters) - On Aug. 24, after waiting for five months in the violent Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez for a U.S. asylum hearing, Elida, a Guatemalan migrant, decided to send her disabled 12-year-old son Gustavo into the United States alone. 
Elida feared for Gustavo's safety in Mexico, after a stranger tried to take him from her, she said. She had been told by other migrants that as an unaccompanied child Gustavo would be detained by U.S. immigration agents and then released to his grandfather who lives in South Carolina. 
She took him to a park near the bridge connecting Ciudad Juarez to the Texan city of El Paso, gave him his birth certificate, tucked scraps of papers with family phone numbers into his clothes, hugged him goodbye and then watched him walk into the United States.
The same day, Gustavo's family says his grandfather got a call with what they thought was good news - the boy was in the United States and authorities wanted the family's address.
Then, Gustavo effectively vanished. No further word came about his whereabouts.
Elida, 44, who asked to be identified only by her first name for safety reasons, was already racked by guilt, feeling that she had abandoned her son. Now, she was panic stricken.
She would not learn about his whereabouts for nearly a week, until a Guatemalan news blog posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that Gustavo was in Guatemalan government custody and that officials were trying to locate his parents. 
The story of how Gustavo disappeared and then reappeared in Guatemala is emblematic of what U.S. immigration rights activists say is an opaque, chaotic new system that President Donald Trump's administration has implemented to expel migrants, including unaccompanied children, during the pandemic. 
Under an emergency health order issued in March, which the Trump administration says is necessary to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the United States has expelled thousands of unaccompanied children under the age of 18 without giving them the chance to claim asylum, bypassing long-standing protections under U.S. law.
As of June, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) figures indicate some 2,000 minors had been expelled. More recent numbers are not available.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is suing the government over the expulsions, has said the order goes further than anything the Trump administration has done to restrict access to asylum, leaving ""almost no avenue open to seek protection.""
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency declined to give information about the circumstances of Gustavo's case. ICE (NYSE:ICE) requested that Elida sign privacy waivers to allow the agency to talk about her and her son's case. After these were provided, they referred questions to CBP, which declined comment on the specifics of the case.
Matthew Dyman, a CBP spokesman, said the emergency order applies to everyone, ""no matter their disability or age.""
While U.S. officials do have discretion, exempting groups of people from the order ""defeats the whole purpose and puts everyone at risk,"" Dyman said in response to questions from Reuters. Dyman said providing details about exemptions could be exploited by human smugglers. 
As it prepares to fly children to their home countries, the government has been holding them in hotels with unlicensed contractors to look after them, for days or sometimes weeks, according to court documents.
Attorneys say the children's personal information is not recorded in the usual computer systems, making them almost impossible to track.
The nonprofit Kids In Need of Defense (KIND) said it has been able to help about 70 children through a patchwork of private attorneys, family members and advocates.
""A drop in the bucket,"" said Jennifer Podkul, KIND's Vice President for Policy and Advocacy.
The organization said it was aware of some Central American children who had been returned across the border to Mexico alone, and others who had been sent to their home countries without their parents' knowledge. They said they have also received frantic phone calls from parents looking for their children.
U.S. law has long held that children need extra protections from trafficking and exploitation. Before the March order, unaccompanied children would be moved quickly into short-term foster care or shelters overseen by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), until they could be released to vetted sponsors, usually family members. 
    ORR's network is operating far below its capacity of 13,600 taxpayer-funded beds. As of Sept. 3, it was housing 1,039 children. Some 159 children in ORR custody had tested positive for the coronavirus as of that date, the agency said in a statement to Reuters.
A FRANTIC SEARCH
Four days after Gustavo's grandfather received the call from the U.S. official, the family had still heard no further word on Gustavo's whereabouts.
Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Toczylowski, who runs the Immigrant Defenders Law Center in Los Angeles, said she heard about the case from another lawyer and emailed immigration officials to ask where Gustavo was. 
She received an email saying ICE was working on placing Gustavo in a U.S. shelter. But minutes later, that message was recalled and a new one arrived from a different deportation officer. Gustavo had already been expelled to Guatemala, alone.
On Aug. 30, six days after she had said goodbye to her son, Elida saw on Facebook that the Guatemalan government was searching for Gustavo's parents ""with great urgency.""
Elida was still in Ciudad Juarez, fearful for her safety but also afraid to return home. 
'WANTED THE  BEST  (NYSE:BEST) FOR HIM'
Elida and Gustavo left Guatemala after she received death threats following a family dispute, she said. Gustavo, who has deformed limbs and learning difficulties, had also been attacked by a child wielding a machete several years ago.
His foot was cut to the bone and the injury still makes it difficult for him to walk, she said. Apart from the physical deformities he was born with, Gustavo struggles to speak to people outside his immediate family.
""God made my child that way,"" she said. ""I've always accepted him as he is.""
Mother and son arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border in February, planning to ask for asylum. They were sent by U.S. authorities to Ciudad Juarez under the Migrant Protection Protocols, a Trump policy which sends some non-Mexican migrants to Mexico to await their U.S. immigration court hearings.
Elida became a fruit seller to earn money to rent a room and buy food. The neighborhood was violent, she said, and she worried about leaving Gustavo during the day. One day when she went to get water, she heard a gunshot and saw a dead body lying in the street.
On Aug. 22, a man tried to grab Gustavo from her in the street, she said. Reuters could not independently verify her account, but advocacy group Human Rights First has documented hundreds of kidnappings and attacks on migrants waiting in Mexico for their U.S. court dates.
Two days later, Elida took Gustavo to the border. ""I felt sad because I'd left him,"" she said. ""But I told myself it was for his good. I've always wanted the best for him.""
It was the first time they had been apart since he was born.
On Sept. 5, almost two weeks after he walked across the border alone, Gustavo was reunited with his father Juan in their remote village in the mountains of northeastern Guatemala. The family reunion was organized by government officials.
He stepped off a bus and looked around, disoriented, Reuters witnesses said. At first he did not appear to recognize his father, who said softly to him, ""Come here my son.""
Juan hugged him, crying, and said, ""Look how they sent him to me, they deported him as if he were grown-up, as if he were a criminal, and he is a child.""
Juan called Elida to tell her that Gustavo had arrived. ""Talk to your Mom and say hi to her,"" Juan said to his son, trying to hand him the phone.
Gustavo burst into tears and refused to talk to her. 

He has not forgiven her for leaving him, Elida said. Then she, alone in Ciudad Juarez, also began to sob.

The strongly worded comments from both sides come amid rapidly deteriorating relations between the world's two largest economies ahead of November's U.S. presidential election, with arguments over trade, human rights and the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The People's Daily's response once again exposes the Chinese Communist Party's fear of free speech and serious intellectual debate – as well as Beijing's hypocrisy when it complains about lack of fair and reciprocal treatment in other countries,"" Pompeo said in a statement late on Wednesday.
The refusal by the People's Daily comes after a U.S. decision to revoke more than 1,000 visas of Chinese nationals this week, and as both countries restrict or revoke visas for each others' journalists.
Titled ""Resetting the Relationship Based on Reciprocity"", Ambassador Terry Branstad's article referred to an imbalance in the U.S.-China relationship, noting that U.S. companies, journalists, diplomats, and even civil society suffered unequal access in China. 
""While U.S. journalists face restrictions on reporting and even entering China, Chinese state media workers have long enjoyed open access in the United States,"" Branstad wrote.
Issuing its response in a letter, the People's Daily said the U.S. envoy's article failed to meet its standards.
""In our opinion, the op-ed in the name of Ambassador Branstad is full of loopholes and seriously inconsistent with facts,"" the paper said, in a letter released by the State Department.
In a statement on Thursday, the paper said it had the right, like U.S. media, to decide what it publishes and to make necessary edits, decrying Pompeo's remarks as a vicious attack on Chinese media.
""It is extremely ironic that on the one hand the U.S. side rudely and unreasonably supresses Chinese media like the People's Daily as Communist Party 'propaganda machines', and on the other demands they disseminate wrong points of view for the United States.""
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China's ambassador in Washington, who frequently appears in U.S. media, has never smeared his host country and is committed to promoting friendly exchanges and cooperation. 
Pompeo said China must respect the free press.

""Their refusal to do so shows just how much China's unelected Party elites fear their own people's free-thinking and the free world's judgment about their governance practices inside China.""

LESBOS (Reuters) - Thousands of migrants slept rough on the Greek island of Lesbos on Thursday after a blaze razed their makeshift camp to the ground, leaving them with nowhere to go.
Greek authorities transferred more than 400 unaccompanied children and teenagers to the mainland in the early hours of Thursday on three chartered flights.
But many more people remained stuck in Lesbos without homes or shelter. Families slept on roadsides and in supermarket parking lots and fields across the island, which was at the forefront of the European migrant crisis in 2015-2016.
About 12,500 people had lived in the Moria camp, already notorious for its poor living conditions. Tuesday night's inferno reduced it to a mass of smouldering steel and melted tent tarpaulin.
A second fire broke out on Wednesday night, destroying whatever was left. Police reinforcements were brought in to prevent migrants from reaching the island's main town of Mytilene, confining them to fields and roadsides.
An eight-year-old Congolese girl Valencia, who was barefoot, gestured to a Reuters reporter that she was hungry and asked for a biscuit.
""Our home burned, my shoes burned, we don't have food, no water,"" she said.
Both she and her mother Natzy Malala, 30, who has a newborn infant, slept on the side of the road.
""There is no food, no milk for the baby,"" Natzy Malala said. 
Greek authorities transfered 406 unaccompanied minors to the mainland early on Thursday, the prime minister's office said.
""The children have been taken to safe facilities in northern Greece where they will stay temporarily, while the programme of their relocation to other EU countries is ongoing,"" it said.
More than 800 unaccompanied minors have been relocated to EU countries so far under the programme, it said.
The migration ministry said it would take ""all necessary steps"" to ensure that vulnerable groups and families had shelter, but these were expected to be met with stiff resistance from local residents. 
Authorities were already at loggerheads with Lesbos residents over plans to replace Moria with a closed reception centre, which the residents fear would mean thousands of asylum seekers remaining their permanently.
Municipalities were at odds over the handling of the situation, said Costas Moutzouris, governor of the Northern Aegean.
""There is no decision. It's up in the air,"" he told Reuters.
A government official who declined to be named said that sheltering migrants on boats was not a safe solution and was sending the wrong message to migrants who would want to leave Lesbos.

Authorities are investigating whether Tuesday night's fires were started deliberately after COVID-19 tests led to the isolation of 35 refugees.

The Saudi-led coalition, which has been at war with the Iran-aligned group since 2015, did not immediately confirm the attacks.
Yahya Sarea, a spokesman for the Houthi military, said the group used a Dul-Faqqar ballistic missile and three Samad3 drones to attack an important target in Riyadh, without giving more details. The group have attacked Riyadh several times before.
""The attacks are a response to the enemy's permanent escalation and its continuing blockade against our country,"" Sarea said in a statement posted on Twitter. 
He promised more attacks if Saudi Arabia ""continues its aggression"" against Yemen.
The Houthis took over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and most cities in 2014 after ousting the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
The Western-backed coalition that Saudi Arabia leads intervened to try to restore Hadi to power but the war, which has killed 100,000 people, has been stuck in a stalemate for years.
The conflict has led to what the United Nations describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government confirmed on Thursday it will end enhanced screening of some international passengers for COVID-19 and drop requirements that travelers coming from the targeted countries arrive at 15 designated U.S. airports, starting Monday.
Reuters reported the planned shift Wednesday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement it was removing the requirements because symptom-based screening has limited effectiveness because people with COVID-19 may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms.
The administration imposed enhanced screening requirements in February on travelers who had been in China, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Brazil, Iran and the Schengen region of Europe, and barred most non-U.S. citizens who had recently been in those locations from coming to the United States.
All of those travelers were required to arrive at 15 U.S. airports including Boston, Chicago O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, Detroit, Honolulu, Houston, Atlanta, New York JFK, Miami, Los Angeles, Washington-Dulles, Newark, Seattle and San Francisco.
Airlines for America, a group representing American Airlines (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL), said members ""no longer believe that it makes sense to continue screening at these 15 airports given the extremely low number of passengers identified by the CDC as potentially having a health issue.""
A document seen by Reuters said that of 675,000 passengers screened at the 15 airports in the CDC effort, fewer than 15 had been identified as having COVID-19.
Those travelers numbered around 6,750 a day as of late August and anyone showing signs of illness or possible exposure was referred for public health assessments.

Last month, Reuters reported that the Trump administration's efforts to require airlines to collect contact tracing information from U.S.-bound international passengers had stalled, citing five people briefed on the matter, and that such a directive is unlikely this year.

Gerard Hogan, an advocate general of the Court of Justice of the European Union, said an EU law of 2009 set out that animals should normally be stunned before they are slaughtered, but made a clear exception for slaughter prescribed by religious rites.
EU judges typically follow the opinions of advocate generals although are not bound to do so. They would normally deliver their ruling in two to four months.
The case came to the EU court in Luxembourg after a 2017 decree in the Belgian region of Flanders to amend its law on protection and welfare of animals by requiring all animals be first stunned. 
Jewish and Muslim association challenged the decree and Belgium's Constitutional Court referred the case to the EU Court of Justice.
Hogan said the religious exception reflected the European Union's desire to respect freedom of religion and the right to manifest religious belief in practice and observance despite avoidable suffering caused to animals.
Jewish and Muslim methods of slaughter involves the animals' throats being cut with a sharp knife, which advocates says results in death almost immediately. Traditionally, prior stunning is not permitted.
Belgian campaign group Global Action in the Interest of Animals (GAIA), whose representatives were present at the court on Thursday, said it was disappointed and perplexed by the opinion, but noted the judges might rule differently.
""How will the court deal with (EU) members that have for years had general bans on slaughter without stunning: Denmark, parts of Finland, Slovenia and Sweden?"" said GAIA lawyer Anthony Godfroid.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union sanctions on Belarus are being delayed by a separate dispute between Cyprus and Turkey over energy resources in the Eastern Mediterranean, four EU diplomats said, in the latest sign of paralysis in the bloc's foreign policy.
EU foreign ministers gave their political approval for sanctions on senior Belarus officials at a meeting in Berlin late last month over the Aug. 9 elections that the West say was rigged, in a bid to show support for pro-democracy protesters.
A Cypriot diplomatic source told Reuters that Nicosia has requested time to study the planned EU travel bans and asset freezes because, as one of the EU's smallest states, the island does not have the organisational capacity to review them quickly.
""We support the sanctions, but we need to know what we have before us,"" the diplomatic source said. 
EU foreign policy requires consensus among its 27 members.
However, many EU states feel Cyprus' request, called a ""study reserve"" in diplomatic parlance, is a bid to coerce the other 26 states to agree similar punitive measures on Turkey,
Turkey began drilling for oil and gas near Cyprus last year despite warnings from Brussels, amid broader fears of a military escalation in the Eastern Mediterranean as NATO allies Greece and Turkey hold naval drills in the area.
Cyprus' proposal in June to impose sanctions on more Turkish companies and individuals has not been approved as many EU states, including Germany, want to defuse the Turkey stand-off through dialogue.
'DESPERATE'
With as many as 40 Belarus senior officials identified for possible sanctions and the country a month into mass demonstrations against the outcome of the election, some diplomats are furious the EU has been unable to respond.
""There's a great deal of frustration,"" said a senior EU diplomat involved in decision-making, although another diplomat described Cyprus as ""desperate"" and not ill-intentioned. 
French President Emmanuel Macron will host the Cypriot and Greek leaders in Corsica on Thursday and a breakthrough could still come at an EU foreign ministers meeting on Sept. 21 or at a leaders summit in Brussels on Sept. 24-25.
But the dispute with Cyprus adds to questions about the EU's foreign policy credibility, the diplomats said.
The EU, which was once able to boast of a soft power that helped transform communist neighbours into market economies, is struggling to assert influence, at odds with U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policies.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A Cambodian activist has been imprisoned for five years for plotting to overthrow the government, a court said on Thursday, bringing to 17 the number of administration opponents detained or convicted since late July. 
Pen Mom, 39, was found guilty on Wednesday of conspiring with self-exiled opposition party founder Sam Rainsy to overthrow Prime Minister Hun Sen's government in 2019, the court in the southern province of Kampot said.
The jailing of Pen Mom, a former official in the disbanded Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), comes during a wave of arrests of activists, which started in late July with the detention of Rong Chhun, who accused the government of ceding land to neighbouring Vietnam.
Others held include members of environmental groups Mother Nature and Khmer Thavrak, a politician, a Buddhist monk and a rapper, according to human rights group Licadho, which has been tracking arrests of dissidents and activists. 
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP) has been in power since 1979 and holds every seat in the 125-member legislature following the dissolution of the CNRP before the 2018 general election. 
Monovithya Kem, daughter of detained former CNRP leader Kem Sokha, said the recent crackdown showed the government's blatant abuse of the judicial system to silence dissent.
""It also shows the regime's fear of people pushing back given this unprecedented level of both political and economic turmoil,"" Monovithya Kem told Reuters.
""Our fight for democracy is far from over."" 
Government spokesman Phay Siphan said the administration was open to criticism and those arrested were all part of a overseas network backed by foreigners ""to create social unrest and move to topple the elected government"".

The Kremlin critic is being treated in Berlin's Charite hospital after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight last month. 
Germany says Navalny was the victim of an attempt to kill him and has demanded an explanation from Russia. Moscow has said it has seen no evidence that Navalny, 44, was poisoned.
Der Spiegel magazine said Navalny's police protection had been stepped up in the expectation that he would be receiving more visitors as his condition improved.
""Der Spiegel and Bellingcat understand that Navalny can speak again and can likely remember details about his collapse,"" the magazine wrote, crediting its investigative website partner. ""His statements could be dangerous for people behind the attack.""
There was no immediate comment by the hospital treating Navalny. A Berlin police spokesman had no comment. Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, tweeted that ""the story is exaggerated and contains many factual inaccuracies"" in apparent reference to the Spiegel piece.
The Navalny affair has driven tensions between Russia and the West to new heights, with some Western governments believing Navalny was poisoned by Russian security services with top-level backing.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday there was a ""substantial chance"" his poisoning was ordered by senior Russian officials.
Berlin faces calls for a sharper response to the poisoning. Some opposition politicians have called for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, a Kremlin flagship project, to be cancelled, even as it nears completion.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte was quoted on Thursday as saying Russian President Vladimir Putin had told him he would set up a committee to investigate Navalny's case and ""was ready to collaborate with the German authorities"".

The three-day exercise in the eastern side of the strait in the Gulf of Oman is aimed at improving Tehran's military might to confront ""foreign threats and any possible invasion"", the commander of the manoeuvre, Admiral Habibollah Sardari, told TV.
Naval, air and ground forces, including submarines and drones, were participating in the drill, called Zolfaghar-99, the report said.
There have been periodic confrontations between Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards and the U.S. military in the Gulf in recent years. Washington has accused the Guards’ navy of sending fast-attack boats to harass U.S. warships in the strait.
The spokesman for the drill, Admiral Shahram Irani, told state TV that the United States had withdrawn drones from the area of the exercise after a warning from Iran.
Tehran, which opposes the presence of U.S. and Western navies in the area, holds annual war games in the strait, the conduit for some 30% of all crude traded by sea.
Tensions have risen between Tehran and Washington since 2018, when the United States withdrew from a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six major powers, and reimposed sanctions. Iran has threatened to block the Strait if its crude exports were shut down by U.S. sanctions.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Sri Lankan navy has towed a fire-stricken supertanker further out to sea to keep it off the coast of the Indian Ocean island after the wind picked up strength and changed direction, a spokesman said on Thursday.
The tanker, loaded with 2 million barrels oil, was 50 nautical miles (95 km) from the east coast and moving in a northerly direction, the navy spokesman, Indika de Silva, said. Earlier, it had been headed southwest.
The stricken vessel has raised fears of an environmental disaster, but two oil slicks in its trail are the result of escaping marine fuel oil, rather than leaking crude.
A fire broke out in the engine room of the Greek-owned New Diamond tanker last Thursday. The blaze was believed to have been doused on Sunday but reignited a day later.
De Silva ruled out the possibility of fire breaking out again after a team of salvage experts visited the ship on Wednesday.
New Shipping Ltd, the manager of the Panama-flagged New Diamond, has appointed SMIT Singapore Pte Ltd as its salvage expert, he said.
There was no immediate comment from either company.
A preliminary investigation by the salvage firm showed the presence of a toxic gas in and around the vessel, de Silva said, but gave no further details.
Sri Lanka's Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) has said it plans to take action against the ship's owner under the country's laws to protect the marine ecosystem.

The oil slicks have been sprayed with chemical dispersants from a Dornier aircraft deployed by the Indian Coast Guard.

Navalny, a prominent critic of Putin, is being treated in a Berlin hospital after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight last month. Germany says he was poisoned with a nerve agent. Russia has said it has seen no evidence that Navalny was poisoned.
""President Putin has assured me (in a recent conversation) that Russia intends to clear up what has happened, and told me that he would set up a committee of inquiry and was ready to collaborate with the German authorities,"" Italy's Conte told the newspaper Il Foglio in an interview.

""Collaboration is the best way to prevent this dramatic event from negatively affecting relations between the EU and Russia,"" Conte added.

They said the three men, in their early twenties, were taken away in the state capital of Sittwe after protesting with placards that read ""oppose murdering fascism"" and called for the restoration of internet access, which authorities say has been cut in swathes of Rakhine for security reasons.
A police officer in Sittwe hung up the phone when contacted by Reuters for comment on the detention of the students.
Video streamed on social media from the police station on Thursday showed dozens of people outside to demand the release of the men.
Rakhine state has been roiled for more than a year by fighting between government troops and ethnic insurgents from the Arakan Army, which is fighting for greater autonomy for the western region. 
Tens of thousands have been displaced and dozens killed in shelling and crossfire.
Thaw Zin Tun, a spokesman for the Arakan Students’ Union, the group that organised the protest, said on Thursday the three had been detained pending further investigation but there had been no contact with them since their arrest.
Burma Human Rights Network (BHRN), a U.K-based campaign group, said the three arrested were part of a group of students that had visited minority Rohingya camps outside Sittwe in recent weeks.
Tens of thousands of Rohingya, a Muslim minority in Rakhine state, are confined to camps and villages and deprived of rights including freedom of movement.
The state has long been a tinderbox of tension between Rohingya and ethnic Rakhine, a mostly Buddhist group that make up the majority.

Kyaw Win, founder of BHRN said the students were ""an example of a way to a better future in Burma, yet have been criminalised and deprived of their freedoms"".

The centre-right Liberal party and the rural-focused Nationals have a decades-old partnership in both state and federal politics, which sees power shared across cabinet positions when in government.
NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro, from the Nationals, said his party would no longer support government legislation unless changes were made to policy drafted to protect koala habitats.
Barilaro said new policy unfairly limits the way rural property owners can manage their land but he maintained his party supported conservation.
""We actually want to see the population double. We are not anti-koala,"" Barilaro said.
The Nationals will abstain from voting on government legislation, except when it affected regional areas, forcing the government to find support elsewhere for its policies.
The party will also introduce a bill next week to repeal the conservation law.
The Nationals hold 13 seats in the lower house while the Liberals hold 35, giving the coalition a majority in the 93-member house.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, the leader of the coalition and the state Liberal party, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
An inquiry in June found koalas in NSW could become extinct by 2050 unless the government immediately intervened.
Land clearing for agriculture, urban development, mining and forestry had been the biggest factor in the loss of habitat. 
Koalas live in eucalyptus forests, located mainly in the country's east.
New policy restricts construction in habitats and owners of the land must seek exemptions to conduct various works.
Corey Bradshaw, professor of global ecology at Flinders University, said NSW had some of the weakest anti-clearing laws in Australia. 

""Koalas live in and eat trees - you don't need a university degree to predict what will happen when you continue to destroy their already highly degraded habitats,"" Bradshaw said in an emailed statement.

About 44% of respondents, asked whom they would pick as Abe's successor, said they would choose Suga, while 36% favoured former Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Suga held a clearer lead among supporters of the leading Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
The poll, taken by the newspaper and Social Survey Research Centre, is the latest to show the chief cabinet secretary as the most popular candidate among ordinary voters.
The LDP leadership election will be held on Sept. 14, with LDP lawmakers and regional party representatives casting votes. The winner - who will serve the rest of Abe's term as party chief, which ends in September 2021 - is virtually assured of becoming premier because of the LDP's majority in parliament.
The surge in the popularity of Suga, who has served as chief cabinet secretary under Abe and has said he would pursue his boss's key policies, is stoking speculation about a snap election for parliament's lower house as early as next month. 
No election is mandated until October 2021, but Suga may call a vote while his ratings are high to try to improve his chances of winning a full three-year term as party leader next year.
Defence Minister Taro Kono, in an online event sponsored by a U.S. think tank, said on Wednesday an election was expected ""probably sometime in October"", domestic media reported.
Talk of a general election has added urgency to efforts by the fragmented opposition to unify, pushing the centre-left Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) to merge with former colleagues in the Democratic Party for the People (DPP).
The two groups emerged when the Democratic Party of Japan, which held government from 2009-2012, split in 2017.
On Thursday, the new party picked CDPJ leader Yukio Edano as its leader and voted to retain the CDPJ label for the new party.
Edano urged the government to open an extra session of parliament for debate but added: ""If for their own selfish reasons they run away from this, we will face them head on and give the people a choice.""
The new CDPJ will have 149 incumbents members of parliament, compared with the LDP's nearly 400.
Support for the LDP dwarfs that for the new opposition group, although the merger has improved its backing.

A Kyodo news agency survey released on Wednesday showed 48.1% would vote for the LDP against 15.7% for the merged party, up from just 4% who backed the CDPJ in a recent poll.

(Reuters) - An unprecedented spate of fierce, wind-driven wildfires in Oregon have all but destroyed five small towns, leaving a potentially high death toll in their wake, the governor said on Wednesday, as initial casualty reports began to surface.
Hundreds of miles away in northern California, three fatalities were confirmed on Wednesday from a lightning-sparked conflagration that raged with renewed intensity this week after firefighters had made significant headway containing it.
While more than two dozen major blazes continued to wreak havoc across wide swaths of California, the neighboring state of Oregon bore the latest brunt of wildfires plaguing much of the western United States over the past week. 
Winds of up to 50 miles per hour (80 kilometers per hour) sent flames racing tens of miles within hours, engulfing hundreds of homes as firefighters fought at least 35 large blazes in Oregon with a collective footprint nearly twice the size of New York City.
Several Oregon communities, including the town of Detroit in the Santiam Valley, as well as Blue River and Vida in coastal Lane County, and Phoenix and Talent in southern Oregon, were substantially destroyed, Governor Kate Brown told a news conference.
""This could be the greatest loss in human lives and property due to wildfire in our state’s history,"" Brown said, without providing details.
She described rescue teams saving evacuees by pulling them from rivers where they took refuge from flames.
PACIFIC NORTHWEST CASUALTIES 
A 12-year-old boy and his grandmother died in a wildfire burning near the Santiam Valley community of Lyons, about 50 miles south of Portland, KOIN News reported. 
The fire also was suspected of causing at least one death outside of Ashland (NYSE:ASH), said Rich Tyler, spokesman for the Oregon State Fire Marshal.
Farther north, multiple blazes also roared on in Washington state, where a 1-year-old boy was killed and his parents severely burned fleeing a fire in Okanogan County, police said. 
In California, officials said some 64,000 people were under evacuation orders on Wednesday while crews battled 28 major fires across portions of the most populous U.S. state.
About a third of those evacuees were displaced in Butte County alone, north of Sacramento, where a wildfire has scorched more than 200,000 acres since it was ignited on Aug. 17. Almost half of that landscape was consumed since Tuesday, as a newly ferocious flank of that blaze dubbed the Bear Fire spread largely unchecked over some 97,000 acres.
Residents of more than a dozen towns were told to flee immediately or be prepared to go at a moment's notice.
The remains of three victims were found in two separate locations of that fire zone, according to Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea, bringing the total death toll from this summer's devastating spate of California wildfires to at least 11.
The Bear Fire raged near the outskirts of Paradise, a town largely reduced to ash in 2018, with 85 lives lost, in a firestorm that still ranks as the deadliest in California history.
Separately, a fire crew in Butte County faced a close call on Wednesday when advancing flames sent them scrambling for cover inside a nearby structure as their transport vehicle was incinerated, a state fire official told reporters.
'DRIVING THROUGH HELL'
Firefighters likewise were forced to retreat from uncontrollable blazes in Oregon while officials gave residents ""go now"" orders to evacuate in just minutes.
""It was like driving through hell,"" Jody Evans told local television station NewsChannel21 after a midnight evacuation from Detroit, about 50 miles (80 km) west of Salem, Oregon's capital. 
To the south, parts of Medford, a city of over 80,000 residents - many of them retirees - were under evacuation orders or warnings as a growing wildfire closed a section of Interstate 5, the primary north-south highway along the West Coast.
""Absolutely no area in the state is free from fire,"" said Doug Graf, fire protection chief for the Oregon Forestry Department.
Climate scientists say global warming has contributed to greater extremes in wet and dry seasons across the U.S. West, causing vegetation to flourish then dry out, leaving more abundant, volatile fuel for fires.
In California, all 18 National Forests were closed due to “unprecedented and historic fire conditions,"" the U.S. Forest Service said on Wednesday
The so-called Creek Fire about 35 miles (56 km) north of Fresno, tore through the Sierra National Forest, left especially susceptible to flames due to drought and bark beetle damage, destroying over 360 homes and other structures.

“This fire is just burning at an explosive rate,"" said Daniel Berlant, a spokesman for California's state fire authority. “You add the winds, the dry conditions, the hot temperatures, it’s the perfect recipe.”

The body of Julio Valdivia, 44, who specialized in the ""nota roja"" journalism that focuses on gruesome crime and violence, was found in the remote Tezonapa municipality, about 100 kilometers from the state capital, Veracruz.
A staff member at Valdivia's Diario El Mundo local newspaper in Veracruz said initially it was suspected that Valdivia might have been run over by a train, but that was ruled out by the prosecutor's office.
""Valdivia was found near the train tracks, beheaded and tortured,"" said the newspaper staff member, who did not wish to be identified. 
El Universal and several other local news outlets reported that Valdivia was beheaded, the fourth journalist death in Mexico this year.
In 2019, about half of all murders of journalists around the world occurred in Mexico, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. 
""We condemn the homicide of Julio Valdivia,"" the Veracruz government said on its Twitter account. 

A local media protection group known as the CEAPP said in a statement that Valdivia did not have extra protection measures as he had not reported facing threats to his security. But the group demanded the authorities ""shed light"" on the murder.

Greece and Turkey are in dispute over sea boundaries in the region, in the latest manifestation of decades of friction between the two NATO allies. Turkey has dispatched a survey vessel in an area both countries claim is their own.
""We do need dialogue, but not when held at gunpoint. What threatens my country's security and stability threatens the well-being and safety of all EU member states,"" Mitsotakis said in an article published in the London Times, Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and France's Le Monde newspapers.
This month, EU leaders are expected to specify their response to Turkey. If Turkey does not withdraw its assets, 'meaningful sanctions' should be imposed, the Greek prime minister wrote.
""If Europe wants to exercise true geopolitical power, it simply cannot afford to appease a belligerent Turkey,"" Mitsotakis said.
Turkey, he said, still had time to avoid sanctions and 'take a step back'.
""They should stand down, return to the table, and pick up from where they left off when they quit exploratory talks in 2016. And if we cannot agree, then we must seek resolution at the Hague,"" he said, referring to the international court for sovereign disputes.
French President Emmanuel Macron will discuss the European Union's strained relationship with Turkey later Thursday with Mitsotakis.

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has held numerous military exercises up and down its coast and near the island in recent weeks. 
The defence ministry said Su-30 fighters and Y-8 transport aircrafts were among the Chinese aircraft that entered Taiwan's air identification zone to its southwest on Thursday morning.
""The Defence Ministry once again urged the Chinese Communist Party must not to repeatedly destroy regional peace and stability,"" it said, adding that the action has triggered antipathy among the people of Taiwan. 
Taiwan scrambled aircraft to intercept the Chinese planes, the ministry added, saying it was able to quickly track the ""enemy's movement"". 
China's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Taiwan has repeatedly complained that China, which has not ruled out the use of force to bring the democratic island under its control, has stepped up military threats in recent months as the world tackles the coronavirus pandemic.
Beijing routinely says such exercises are not unusual and are designed to show its determination to defend its sovereignty.

“We welcome the U.S.’s constructive and responsive contributions to Asean’s efforts to maintaining the peace, stability and developments in the South China Sea,” Vietnam Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh said Thursday during a virtual summit between representatives from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Vietnam holds the bloc’s rotating chairmanship.
Southeast Asian countries were open to opportunities for practical cooperation with the U.S. in the region, Minh said. Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia have been locked in territorial disputes with China that have impacted their ability to extract fish, oil and gas from offshore areas.
At a virtual summit a day earlier, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Southeast Asian foreign ministers that the U.S. was intervening in territorial disputes and strengthening its military deployment in the contested area “out of its own political purposes.” He called the U.S. “the biggest driver of militarization of the South China Sea,” according to statements posted by China’s Foreign Ministry.
The U.S. has become “the most dangerous factor that damages the peace in the South China Sea,” Wang said, reiterating China’s position that disputes should be solved by regional countries. “Peace and stability are China’s greatest strategic interest in the South China Sea, which are also the common aspiration of Asean countries,” he said.
Tensions in the South China Sea have risen in the past few months as the U.S. and China spar on everything from democracy in Hong Kong to data security over popular Chinese apps TikTok and WeChat. In July, the U.S. explicitly rejected China’s expansive maritime claims in the region for the first time, and sent aircraft carriers to the waters to conduct military exercises.
China last month fired missiles into the South China Sea, a move that underscored the growing cost of any armed conflict in the region. The missiles showed China’s ability to strike out at U.S. bases and aircraft carriers, the major sources of American power projection in the region.
At a separate meeting Wednesday, Pompeo joined several Asean countries in raising concerns over the China’s actions in the South China Sea, according to a State Department statement. He reiterated that the U.S. regarded Beijing’s expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea as unlawful according to a 2016 international tribunal ruling that China regards as illegitimate because it opted out of dispute settlement provisions when it signed up for United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
“We express serious concern over ongoing developments on the ground including serious incidents, continued militarization and activities that infringe on the lawful rights of small countries, run counter to international law,” Minh, the Vietnamese minister, said, citing the 1982 UN Convention for the Law of the Sea. “These have eroded trust and confidence, increased tensions and undermined peace, security and rule of law in the region.”
On Wednesday, Wang rejected the idea that China claims all waters within the nine-dash line as its territorial sea, calling it a “distortion” of China’s stance. He insisted China’s claim of islands in the South China Sea has “abundant historic and legal basis.”
He also argued that Chinese construction on reefs and islets was meant to improve living conditions and provide “public good” for the region. “In the face of a non-regional country’s military pressure, of course we have the right to protect our own sovereignty,” he said.
The U.S. said it also joined several countries in raising concerns over the imposition of sweeping national security legislation on Hong Kong, the arrests of pro-democracy students, the yearlong postponement of elections and disqualification of pro-democracy electoral candidates.
In response, Wang said the East Asia Summit had “never been a venue for interfering into other countries’ internal affairs, and should not become a stage to attack other countries’ political system.”

Kono, tipped as a future Japanese leader, made the comments Wednesday in an online forum hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Speculation over an early election was fueled by a leap in support for ailing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet in polls released in the past week, just as Yoshihide Suga emerged as the favorite to succeed him.
Suga, widely expected to be selected as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party next week as Abe steps down for health reasons, said Tuesday the country was not in a situation for a general election, given the virus outbreak. The LDP is expected to use its majority in parliament to elect Suga, the right-hand man to Abe, as prime minister on Sept. 16.
Election timing is the prerogative of the prime minister and none need be held for about another year. Polls have shown most people oppose the idea of a vote before the end of 2020.
The LDP’s junior coalition partner, Komeito, has expressed caution over the idea of an early election. Party leader Natsuo Yamaguchi said earlier this week that dealing with the coronavirus should be the priority, national broadcaster NHK reported.
A newly unified opposition party is set to elect a leader Thursday in a bid to offer a more compelling alternative. But the LDP, which has governed Japan almost continuously since 1955, is virtually guaranteed to keep its majority in the next election due to a huge slate of incumbents, strong funding and a public support rate well ahead of the opposition’s.
Japan’s second wave of virus cases has been tailing off in recent weeks, with about 500 new infections reported Sept. 9, about a third of levels seen a month earlier. The economic effects have been dire, with the country experiencing its worst contraction on record in the April-June quarter.

(Reuters) - Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey was accused in a civil lawsuit on Wednesday of sexual assault and battery in the 1980s by actor Anthony Rapp and a second, unnamed person when both plaintiffs were about 14.
The suit, filed in New York state court in Manhattan, refers to the same alleged incident that Rapp first recounted in an October 2017 BuzzFeed interview that triggered Spacey's fall from grace in Hollywood.
Spacey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The actor, who won Oscars for the films ""American Beauty"" and ""The Usual Suspects"" and a Golden Globe for the TV political drama ""House of Cards,"" has largely retreated from public life in the past three years.
Spacey in 2017 said he did not remember the encounter Rapp described but added, ""If I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior."" 
Spacey, now 61, came out as gay in 2017.
Rapp, best known for starring in the Broadway musical ""Rent,"" alleged in the lawsuit that Spacey ""engaged in an unwanted sexual advance"" with him when he was 14, during a party at Spacey's home in 1986.
The second person, identified only as C.D., alleged that he and Spacey had oral and anal sex and engaged in other sexual acts on several occasions in the early 1980s when the plaintiff was approximately 14 years old.
Both men are seeking unspecified damages for emotional distress.
Rapp's initial accusation, part of the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct, led to Spacey being dropped from ""House of Cards"" and his scenes in the movie ""All the Money in the World"" were re-shot with actor Christopher Plummer.
Rapp and the second man filed their lawsuit under New York's 2019 Child Victims Act, their lawyer Peter J. Saghir said. The act gave people one year, later extended to two, to sue over sexual abuse allegations regardless of when they occurred.
""This lawsuit sends a strong message that no matter how wealthy, powerful or famous you may be you are not above the law,"" Saghir said in a statement.

Prosecutors in Massachusetts in 2019 dropped criminal charges against Spacey of felony indecent assault and battery involving an 18 year-old man in a bar in 2016. Spacey had pleaded not guilty. The case was dropped after the alleged victim declined to testify.

Navalny, who is being treated in a Berlin hospital, was airlifted to Germany after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight last month.
Germany says he was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent in an attempt to murder him. Russia has said it has seen no evidence that Navalny was poisoned.
""I think the world has matured and come to an understanding that this is not how normal countries operate, and this will prove costly for the Russians,"" Pompeo said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - At a university campus demonstration in Bangkok on Aug. 10, the images of two men were projected onto a giant screen against a shimmering golden background as protesters mockingly chanted “Long live the king.”  
The images were not of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who holds a place of “revered worship” in the Thai constitution and whose image is omnipresent on city streets, schools and businesses, but of two exiles who have openly criticized the monarchy.
Former diplomat Pavin Chachavalpongpun and historian Somsak Jeamteerasakul have not been involved in organizing a recent series of demonstrations and show no sign of working together, but some protesters said their writing and social media posts have helped to loosen the taboo on questioning the monarchy, which is punishable by up to 15 years in prison under Thailand’s lese majeste law.
""The fact that the public discusses the monarchy institution more is because of them,"" said Panusaya Sithijirawattankul, a 21-year old student at Thammasat University in Bangkok. 
""Previously, we were unable to say any of this and if we did, we would risk becoming another exile,"" said Panusaya, who read out a 10-point demand for palace reform at the Aug. 10 protest. It was based on a reform proposal by Somsak, which he wrote a decade ago and revised and published on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) last year, where Panusaya first saw it. 
Somsak’s proposal called for the abolition of the lese majeste law and the end of what he called “one-sided public relations campaigns promoting the monarchy,” among other things. 
The government's deputy spokeswoman, Ratchada Thanadirek, said the two men’s online criticism of the monarchy was “inappropriate.”
“The monarchy is loved and revered by Thais. Insults to the monarchy can upset another group of people. Expressions should take other people’s feelings into consideration too,” she told Reuters.  
“Criticising the monarchy is a legitimate act,” Pavin told Reuters. Somsak did not respond to requests for comment.
Since July 18, a growing number of mostly young protesters have gathered on Bangkok’s streets and university campuses calling for changes to a political system they say assures prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha a hold on power. The protests have focused on Prayuth, but some protesters have also called for reform of the monarchy. More than 10,000 people attended the biggest of the rallies on Aug. 16. Another big gathering is planned for Sept. 19.
Prayuth, who led a military coup in 2014, says elections held last year were fair. His security forces have arrested more than a dozen leaders of the demonstrations for breaching internal security laws and defying an emergency decree banning public gatherings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. All protesters have been released on bail. 
Pavin and Somsak, who now live in Japan and in France, respectively, have been singled out for attack by Prayuth.
""Where are they now and how are they taking responsibility for the damage afflicted on our country?"" Prayuth said on Aug. 25, referring to the two men specifically, when asked about royal criticism on social media. 
The Royal Palace in Bangkok declined to comment on the recent protests and on overseas critics of the monarchy. In addition to Pavin and Somsak, at least 102 other Thais have gone into exile since the 2014 coup, mostly for fear of prosecution for lese majeste, according to campaign group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights.
In April 2017, Prayuth's military government said anyone sharing  what it described as “false information” from the two men, as well as UK-based author and former Reuters journalist Andrew MacGregor Marshall, could face prison under the Computer Crime Act. Later that month, police arrested and detained four people after they shared a Facebook post by Somsak but did not proceed with charges, according to legal group iLaw, which keeps track of the Thai government’s moves to restrict freedom of expression. Thai police did not respond to questions from Reuters. 
The threat of prosecution has not deterred many Thais. Each of the three men has hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter and Facebook, many of whom share and comment on their material. 
Royalist Marketplace, a private Facebook group set up by Pavin in April, had more than 1 million followers before the Thai government demanded that Facebook make the page unavailable within Thailand. Facebook, which complied on Aug. 24, said it was “compelled” by the government to make Pavin’s group inaccessible. Within a week Pavin’s replacement group on Facebook, with an almost identical name, had attracted more than 1 million followers. 
The Royalist Marketplace group and its successor provide a platform for Thais to discuss the country’s traditional culture that promotes the monarch as a semi-divine leader of the nation who must never be questioned, even though it leaves them open to prosecution under the lese majeste law if they criticize the monarchy. 
“The movement's real catalyst is Royalist Marketplace,” said Titipol Phakdeewanich, a political scientist at Ubon Ratchathani University. “This is the main reason why the government wanted to shut it down."" 
Pavin and Somsak are reviled by Thai traditionalists who believe the monarchy must never be questioned.   
""They are exiles because they have committed illegal actions and have illegal thoughts,"" said Warong Dechgitvigrom, a politician who launched the Thai Pakdee (Loyal Thais) group in response to the student protests. ""They're dangerous because they incite hatred and bully and smear the monarchy.""
Pavin, who has not been charged with lese majeste, rejected Warong’s accusation. 
Somsak was charged with lese majeste in 2011 over two articles he posted on Facebook about Vajiralongkorn’s sister. He denies wrongdoing in the case, which remains open, saying the lese majeste law only applies to the king, queen and heir to the throne.
PARODY AND HISTORY
Pavin, 49, is a former Thai diplomat who quit the foreign service in 2010. He told Reuters he left because during a posting in Singapore, he was upset at having to defend the military coup in 2006 that removed populist Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra from power. Thai authorities declined to comment on why Pavin left the foreign service. 
He worked as an academic in Singapore before moving to Japan in 2012 and is now an associate professor at the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University in Japan. 
“I'm only glad that whatever I've been fighting for so long, that those people (protesters) begin to appreciate whatever I paved the way for them,” Pavin told Reuters. He said he is not involved in organising any protests but once addressed a demonstration for a few minutes via video link at the request of students.
Almost half a million Thais read his analytical Facebook posts on the monarchy and thousands watch his TikTok videos in which he lip-syncs to songs and acts out soap opera dialogues to mock the royal family.
Somsak, 62, cuts a more solemn figure. Still, his face and shock of white hair are a popular image on people’s T-shirts at demonstrations.
Many protesters say he is respected for his historical knowledge of Thai monarchs and his knowledge of the inner-workings of the royal family and its spending. 
In 1976, he was one of the 2,000 pro-democracy students at Thammasat University that were attacked by state forces and royalist supporters which accused them of being anti-monarchist, communist sympathisers. Dozens of protesters were killed. He fled to France after the Prayuth-led coup in 2014. 
Marshall, 49, was a Reuters journalist for 16 years until 2011, mostly in Asia including two years in Bangkok. He has written two books on Thailand, the latest called ""A Kingdom in Crisis,"" which is banned in Thailand. He moved back to his native Scotland in 2016 and is now a journalism lecturer at Edinburgh Napier University. He has not been charged with lese majeste. 
“One of the most striking developments of the past few years is the collapse of royalist mythology,” Marshall told Reuters, adding that many Thais, especially younger people who spend time online, no longer believe what he described as “palace propaganda.” 
Government spokeswoman Ratchada said the government respects young Thais’ freedom of expression but said they should not cross the line into illegality by criticizing the monarchy. 
At the Aug. 16 demonstration, protesters carried large, gilt-framed portrait photographs of Pavin, Somsak and Marshall.  

“Now they put me on a gold frame and raise it, just like what true royalists would do the royal family,” Pavin told Reuters. “It's parody. It's a part of the political tactic.”

On Saturday the junta began talks with Mali's political parties and civil society groups over a transition to civilian rule. The move was welcomed by the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), but it kept sanctions in place.
Dicko, a Salafist preacher who earlier this year electrified protesters during anti-government demonstrations, told the state broadcaster late on Wednesday that Mali needed assistance and that it had nothing to gain by going behind the back of the international community.
""If the international community, including ECOWAS, now thinks that the presidency of this transition should be given to civilians, let's give it to civilians,"" Dicko said, ruling himself out of the running.
""Mali is full of executives, men of integrity, let's find this rare bird.""
President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita resigned and dissolved parliament last month after being detained at gunpoint. The military takeover was welcomed by many Malians, tired of violence by Islamist and ethnic militias and alleged high-level corruption. 
Opposition groups also voiced enthusiastic support for the coup, but the honeymoon looked to be over last week when the opposition coalition, of which Dicko is a senior figure, sharply criticised the junta after it wasn't invited to preliminary consultations about the transition.
International powers fear the political uncertainty in Bamako could undermine the fight across West Africa's Sahel region against Islamist militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State, as a previous coup in 2012 did.
Jihadist fighters killed three Malian soldiers and destroyed two vehicles in an attack near Alatona, Segou region, in central Mali on Wednesday, army spokesman Diarran Koné told Reuters in a message.

Octogenarian Conde was first elected in 2010, and was re-elected in 2015. He pushed a constitutional amendment in March which allowed him to stand again and potentially extend his rule, despite protests from the opposition. 
At least 30 people have been killed during demonstrations against the constitutional change over the past year, before and after a March referendum.

The Euroforce arrived off of Freeport, Texas, on Wednesday and had retained Texas Marine Agency, a Houston-based cargo agent, in preparation to offload its fuel, the spokesperson for Brazos Pilots Association said. Texas Marine referred inquiries to the U.S. Department of Justice. 
The United States government last month said it seized fuel from Iran-linked tankers that was bound for Venezuela, part of Washington's efforts to disrupt trade between Venezuela and Iran. 
The fuel was transferred to the Euroforce and Maersk Progress, two large tankers, according to data and sources. The Maersk Progress is due to arrive in Houston later this month. 
A DOJ spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment. In August, the DOJ said the fuel seized had been bound for Venezuela and was then in U.S. custody. (https://tinyurl.com/y4352p63)
The Euroforce was carrying about 640,000 barrels of gasoline when it arrived in Freeport, according to Refinitiv Eikon tanker tracking data. A port of Freeport spokesman said the vessel was not scheduled to be unloaded at the port's public docks and likely would be handled by one of two private docks. 
Owners of four Iranian fuel cargoes have challenged the seizure in a U.S. District Court, asserting their rights to control the cargoes, which they said were bound for customers in Peru and Colombia.
Venezuela, which has the world's largest crude oil reserves, is rationing gasoline leaving residents in long lines at service stations. Three fuel tankers that left Iran in August are on their way to the South American nation.

Mukwege has won international recognition, including the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize, for decades of work treating female victims of the conflict in Bukavu in east Democratic Republic of Congo.
He has long campaigned for an international tribunal into possible war crimes committed from 1993 to 2003, as well as for prosecution of armed groups responsible for ongoing sexual violence in eastern Congo.
Mukwege's recent comments embroiled him in a dispute with neighbouring Rwanda, whose defence minister last month accused Mukwege of peddling propaganda.
The United Nations said his life was in danger after he and his family received death threats via social media and by phone.
The U.N. suspended its protection in May because of a coronavirus outbreak amongst the peacekeepers stationed to Panzi hospital.
""Peacekeepers are back there to ensure the security of Panzi hospital,"" said Mathias Gillmann, a spokesperson for the U.N.'s peacekeeping mission in Congo.
The UN will continue to help train local police to provide a longer-term security arrangement, Gillmann said.
""The personal security of Congolese personalities is a responsibility of the Congolese authorities.""
Last week thousands of Mukwege's supporters marched through the streets of Bukavu, demanding his protection.
""We welcome the redeployment of elements from #MONUSCO to #Panzi this morning to ensure the safety of our patients and staff,"" Mukwege said in a tweet.
The ongoing violence in eastern Congo has its roots in ethnic and political wounds dating back to the Rwanda's 1994 genocide that spilled across the border.

Later invasions of Congo by Rwanda-backed forces in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide fuelled two gruesome civil wars that killed several million people.

Especially hard hit have been the Sulu Sea and coastal areas of the southern Philippines, said the report by Babel Street, an open source data analysis company based in Virginia.
The author, McDaniel Wicker, a former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer and a company vice president, said rising crime in that area carried significant security implications. The Sulu Sea, he said, is a key shipping route and controlling crime there would require shifting regional security forces from other areas where they also are needed.
“There’s also a very serious global Islamic terror threat tied up in this,” Wicker continued, referring to the Abu Sayyaf Group, which is based in the southern Philippines and has links to Islamic State.
There have been at least 50 incidents of piracy, armed robbery and kidnapping for profit in Asian waters during the first seven months of 2020, the vast majority of them in the Sulu Sea and the Strait of Malacca, the world’s busiest shipping lane, Wicker said.
Those were double the numbers of such incidents recorded for the same period last year and represent the highest level since 2016, according to the report, citing data from a regional anti-piracy coalition.
The Abu Sayyaf Group was responsible for many attacks this year, it said.
The rise in the group's maritime activities has paralleled stepped up attacks in the southern Philippines. An Aug. 24 suicide bombing killed 14 people, including security force personnel, it said.

LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - Thousands of migrants were left without shelter on Wednesday after overnight fires gutted their overcrowded camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, and authorities warned that some asylum seekers who tested positive for COVID-19 could spread the virus.
The Moria camp, which hosts more than 12,000 people, was ""probably totally destroyed"", a Greek migration official said.
Authorities said they were investigating arson at the sprawling camp. Early Wednesday evening, a new fire broke out, sending those who remained on site fleeing.
A Reuters witness reported seeing a ""huge"" column of black smoke emerging from the camp. Live images showed people running down a road carrying children and infants, many using prams to transport possessions crammed into bin bags as a fire raged in a gully.
Before the fire, Moria was notorious for its poor living conditions. Pope Francis visited the facility in 2016, in an attempt to highlight conditions and show solidarity with refugees.
Athens declared a state of emergency on Lesbos and sent police reinforcements to the island to help keep order. Many were obstructed from reaching the island's main town, Mytilene.
Congolese asylum seeker Julia Bukasa, 28, was among a group of 50 migrants obstructed by police, who parked buses along a main road leading to the town. She left with her two children and the clothes on her back.
""We don't have a place to sleep. We don't have anything to eat,"" she told Reuters as she sat on the tarmac breastfeeding her 8-month-old infant. 
Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said about 2,000 people affected by the fires would be temporarily put on a ferry boat and two ships of the Greek navy. The location of the rest of the Moria population was not immediately known.
""The situation in Moria cannot go on (as it is) because it is simultaneously a public health and national security issue,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a televised address, adding that managing migrant flows was a ""European problem"".
Authorities were investigating whether Tuesday night's fires were started deliberately after COVID-19 tests led to the isolation of 35 refugees. Authorities reported that eight of those who tested positive were located.
""There was not just one but many fires in the camp. Migrants threw stones at firefighters trying to put out the fires,"" regional fire chief Constantine Theophilopoulos told ERT TV.
The camp was placed under quarantine last week after an asylum-seeker tested positive for COVID-19. As of late Monday 35 migrants had been confirmed as having the virus.
EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said the European Union had agreed to fund the immediate transfer of 400 unaccompanied children and teenagers to the Greek mainland.
Aid groups have long criticised conditions at the camp, which hosts more than four times its stated capacity. Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, it was frequently singled out by rights groups for its squalid conditions of people stacked in tents, overflowing sewerage and fights over food.
""TRAGICALLY PREDICTABLE""
The UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, said it had received reports of tensions between people in neighbouring villages and asylum seekers.
""Events in Moria last night are unthinkable but tragically predictable as the dire situation on the islands has gone on for far too long,"" said Dimitra Kalogeropoulou, the International Rescue Committee's Greece director.
The UNHCR has previously said that nearly half of migrants now detained on the Greek islands are from Afghanistan and a further 19% are from Syria. Lesbos, which is just off the Turkish coast, was on the front line of Europe's migrant crisis in 2015-16.
Greek authorities put Lesbos under a state of emergency for four months for public health reasons, allowing them to mobilise all forces to support the asylum seekers and island residents.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas described the fires as ""a humanitarian disaster"", and said EU member states should be ready to take in some of the refugees from the camp.
Boris Pistorius, interior minister of the north German state of Lower Saxony and an influential figure in Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD), said it was time to shut the Moria camp.

""This overcrowded camp is the symbol of the failure of Europe's asylum policy,"" he said.

Bizos, known as one of the icons of South Africa's fight for democracy, died of old age at his home in Johannesburg, his family said in a joint statement with the Legal Resource Centre (LRC), where he was a member.
""George Bizos is one of those lawyers who contributed immensely to the attainment of our democracy,"" President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a televised statement, calling him one of the architects of the country's constitution.
Bizos, a human rights champion for all his life, defended Mandela in the 1960s during the Rivonia Trial, named after a suburban locality on the outskirts of Johannesburg where many apartheid opponents were hiding in a farm.
""The friendship between him (Bizos) and Mandela spanned more than seven decades and was legendary,"" the Nelson Mandela Foundation, a nonprofit organisation, said in a statement.
Born in Greece in 1927, Bizos came to South Africa in 1941 at the age of 13 as a World War Two refugee and settled in Johannesburg. He completed his law degree at the University of Witwatersrand in 1951 and was admitted to the Johannesburg Bar in 1950. He served as an advocate in Johannesburg until 1990, according to the foundation.
As member of the Legal Resource Center, a public-interest litigation organisation, Bizos led a team for the government to pass the Constitution in 1996, represented people who were victims of apartheid atrocities, and fought for families whose members were murdered in detention, the LRC said.
""He also played an instrumental role in the negotiations for the release of Nelson Mandela,"" it said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's acting homeland security chief on Wednesday acknowledged that white supremacist extremists played a role in this year's urban violence in the United States, a revision of the administration's public descriptions of the political motivations of violent protesters.
In what was billed as a ""2020 State of the Homeland"" speech, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf initially attributed violence in Portland, Oregon in particular to ""violent opportunists"" and went on to describe how protesters had attacked federal officers with sledge-hammers, pipes, fireworks, homemade bombs and other weapons.
Wolf also attributed violence to both ""white supremacist extremists"" and ""anarchist extremists,"" mentioning white supremacists first, in a speech livestreamed on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) website. 
In contrast, a July 16 DHS press release attributed dozens of incidents of violence in Portland near government buildings to ""violent anarchists."" However, the U.S. Attorney's office in Portland, which has prosecuted dozens of people for riot-related offences, has largely avoided attributing political motives to them.
Portland is one of several cities across the country that became flashpoints in a summer of mostly peaceful protests against racism and police brutality following the May 25 death of a Black man, George Floyd, while in police custody.
One version of a draft DHS 2020 ""State of the Homeland Threat Assessment"" obtained by Lawfare blog editor Ben Wittes described white supremacists as the most deadly internal security threat, mentioning it above the threat from foreign militant groups.
In late July, however, U.S. Attorney General William Barr told Congress: ""I think there are anarchists and far-left groups involved in the violence in Portland. I think antifa is involved in Portland."" Trump has also asserted that antifa was behind violence.

Antifa https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-protests-antifa/us-prosecutors-do-not-charge-portland-protesters-with-antifa-ties-idUSKCN2502NQ, which stands for anti-fascist, is a largely unstructured, far-left movement whose followers broadly aim to confront those they view as authoritarian or racist.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A woman who said she was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking told a U.S. appeals court that Ghislaine Maxwell's desire for privacy failed to justify the continued sealing of a deposition that the British socialite has fought to keep out of the public eye.
Lawyers for Virginia Giuffre made the argument in a Wednesday filing with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ahead of Sept. 22 oral arguments over the release of materials from her now-settled defamation lawsuit against Maxwell.
Many documents from that case were unsealed in July, and Maxwell is appealing U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska's order to release other materials, including her April 2016 deposition and a deposition by a second Epstein accuser.
""Maxwell's vague argument about privacy interests cannot justify total closure of the deposition materials,"" and overcome ""the public's presumption of access,"" Giuffre's lawyers Sigrid McCawley and David Boies told the Manhattan-based appeals court.
Lawyers for Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Maxwell, 58, has pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and eventually abuse three girls from 1994 to 1997 and to committing perjury by denying her involvement with the late financier under oath.
Her trial is scheduled for next July. Epstein killed himself at age 66 in August 2019 at a federal jail in Manhattan while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Maxwell has said her deposition contained ""intimate, sensitive, and personal information,"" and whose release would cause irreversible, negative publicity.
She said this would undermine her constitutional rights to remain silent and obtain a fair trial by an impartial jury, outweighing any presumption of public access.
But lawyers for Giuffre, who has said Epstein kept her as a ""sex slave"" with Maxwell's assistance, said Maxwell did not meet the high legal hurdle of showing Preska abused her discretion.
The lawyers said an unsealing would not compel Maxwell to make self-incriminating statements, saying that she ""was deposed twice in 2016, and twice at that time failed to invoke her right to remain silent.""
They also said there was no basis to credit Maxwell's ""speculative"" fear of unfair pretrial publicity and a tainted jury pool, especially in large metropolitan areas such as New York.
""The size and heterogeneity of such communities make it unlikely that even the most sensational case will become 'a cause celebre' where the whole community becomes interested in all the morbid details,"" Giuffre's lawyers said, quoting a decision from another federal appeals court.

The Miami Herald also wants Maxwell's deposition unsealed.

Maxim Znak was the latest figure to be seized in a systematic campaign by the government of President Alexander Lukashenko to round up leaders of a month-long mass protest movement.
""What is happening is terror against the people,"" said Alexievich, who summoned supporters to her home. ""We have to unite and not give up our intentions. There is a danger we will lose the country,"" she said.
In a show of solidarity with Alexievich, who won the 2015 Nobel Prize for Literature, diplomats from at least seven European countries joined her in her flat. Lithuania said the envoys' aim was partly to protect the author from abuse.
Znak was detained two days after another opposition leader, Maria Kolesnikova, was snatched in the street by masked men. Both are prominent leaders of protests demanding the resignation of Lukashenko following an Aug. 9 presidential election that the opposition says was rigged. Lukashenko denies vote-rigging.
Kolesnikova's lawyer, Lyudmila Kazak, said she was being detained over accusations of an illegal attempt to seize power.
Kazak met Kolesnikova on Wednesday for the first time since her disappearance, saying she was put in a cell with six other people at a pretrial detention centre. Kazak will request a forensic medical examination as Kolesnikova had bruises on her body, she said, according to a statement by Kolesnikova's team. 
Znak's detention leaves Alexievich as the last member of the opposition's Coordination Council still active inside Belarus.
The rest have fled, been forced abroad or detained in a crackdown by Lukashenko's security forces as he seeks to maintain his 26-year-old grip on power. 
The interior ministry said 121 more protesters had been arrested on Tuesday. New protests broke out in Minsk on Wednesday evening and several people were arrested by masked security forces, local media footage showed. 
Lukashenko accuses Western countries of meddling by supporting the opposition. Linas Linkevicius, Lithuania's foreign minister, told Reuters diplomats were at Alexievich's apartment to monitor the situation, and ""because it is harder to resort to brutal methods when diplomatic staff is around"".
""They are visitors to citizen Alexievich, at her invitation,"" he said. ""She is a citizen, she has a flat, and there are guests in the flat"".
A Lithuanian diplomat at the flat said envoys from Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden were there.
NOTHING TO DISCUSS 
Russian news agencies quoted Lukashenko as saying there was nothing to discuss with the opposition. He raised the possibility of constitutional reform and a new presidential election - suggestions he has made in the past - but said it was too early to say when they might happen.
The 66-year-old leader retains the backing of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The West has so far been cautious about the prospect of taking strong action that might provoke Russian intervention, but the European Union is drawing up a list of individuals to target with sanctions.
In the latest sign of Moscow's support for Lukashenko, two banking sources told Reuters that Russia's prime minister and finance minister had told the country's biggest state lenders to ensure liquidity continues to flow to banks in Belarus.
For Russia, Belarus is strategically important as a buffer state against NATO and a transit country for its exports of oil and gas. Russian news agency RIA said Lukashenko would visit Moscow for talks on Monday.
The detention of Znak on Wednesday was part of a criminal case against the opposition's Coordination Council ""for inciting actions aimed at harming the national security of the Republic of Belarus"", his lawyer Dmitry Laevsky said.

Fellow opposition leader Kolesnikova was seized in similar circumstances on Monday. On Tuesday she thwarted an attempt to deport her by tearing up her passport to avoid being forced to cross the border into Ukraine, two of her allies said.

Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party and allies voiced anger this week after Israel's Channel 12 news reported that police and prosecutors had failed to disclose alleged conflicts of interest by an investigator who the report said was involved in the cases against him. 
""It is clear that the police and prosecution are making political decisions against justice and law in order to topple a right-wing prime minister,"" Netanyahu said at the start of a Likud meeting on Wednesday evening. 
""This conduct must be investigated,"" said Netanyahu, who has consistently accused police and prosecutors of bias against him. 
A spokesman for Israel's State Attorney Office declined to comment on Netanyahu's remarks. 
In a statement, Israel's justice ministry said the investigator referenced in the Channel 12 report was not involved in the case in which the person allegedly had a conflict of interest.
Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit called claims of judicial impropriety ""baseless falsehoods entirely intended to delegitimise the justice system and its decisions regarding the prime minister.""
Israel's longest-serving prime minister faces public anger over the corruption allegations and his handling of the pandemic, drawing thousands to the streets in almost daily protests. 
The country has seen a sharp rise in new cases after initial success at the start of the pandemic, and on Tuesday began a week-long campaign of night curfews and school closures. It has reported 1,048 deaths and over 139,000 cases among its nine million population. 
Netanyahu, whose corruption trial began in May and is set to resume in January, was sworn in for a fifth term this summer after striking a unity deal with his principal election rival, former armed forces chief Benny Gantz. 

Speaking after Netanyahu's remarks, Gantz, who has been at odds with the premier over the coronavirus response and fiscal policy, said: ""Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) attacks by the government against the law enforcement system are a danger to Israeli democracy.""

Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez said it was an example of ""unacceptable police brutality,"" on her Twitter account. 
The incident took place early Wednesday morning when, according to police, Javier Humberto Ordonez, 46, was found drinking alcohol in the street with others, in violation of social distancing rules designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
In a video shared on social media, the father of two is pinned to the ground by the officers and subjected to successive electric shocks as he begs them, ""Please, no more.""
Ordonez was subsequently taken to a police station where his friends and family say he was subjected to more abuse. He died later in hospital. 
""We'll offer Javier's family legal assistance so there is a conviction not only of those directly responsible, but also to see structural reform that prevents and punishes police brutality,"" Lopez said on Twitter. ""This isn't about bad apples. Life is sacred!""
The two officers have been relieved of their duties while an internal disciplinary investigation is under way and a separate criminal investigation is conducted by the attorney general's office, Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said in a video posted on Twitter, after condemning the attack.
Protests against Ordonez's death were planned for later Wednesday outside the police command unit where he was held before being taken to a hospital. 
Death at the hands of police in Colombia is infrequent but not unheard of. Last November, teenager Dilan Cruz died in Bogota during mass protests after being hit in the head by a projectile fired by a police officer.
Members of the city's trans community regularly accuse the police of violence toward them.

The charges centred on articles and social media posts published shortly after President Tayyip Erdogan said in February that ""several martyrs"" had been lost in Libya.
Two journalists were sentenced to three years and nine months in jail, while three were given four years and eight months for violation of National Intelligence Agency law, defence lawyer Celal Ulgen told Reuters after the hearing.
The defendants denied the accusations, saying they were doing their jobs as reporters.
""We will take this ruling to an appeals court. This is not a lawful decision, this is a political decision,"" Ulgen said.
Two other defendants were acquitted from the charges and the court delayed the case of an eighth defendant.
Turkey's courts do not generally confirm rulings to the media and there was no word on the case from the government.
Critics say Erdogan has eroded the independence of courts and the media since a crackdown following an attempted coup in 2016. Officials say the courts are autonomous and arrests have been necessary due to security risks. 
Turkey has given military support and training to Libya's internationally-recognised Government of National Accord, helping it fight off an assault on the capital Tripoli by the forces of Khalifa Haftar.

A Moscow court later ruled he will be jailed for two months pending trial, deeming him a flight risk, RIA news agency reported.
One of his lawyers said Tikhonov was not guilty. 
""We intend to prove it,"" he is quoted as saying by RIA. 
Tikhonov, as well as three other people, were detained on allegations of embezzlement of at least 603 million roubles ($7.9 million), the committee said, at the time Tikhonov headed the Russian energy agency (REA), a unit of the ministry.
Tikhonov, 51, is one of eight deputies for Energy Minister Alexander Novak. He was focused on digital projects at the ministry. 
He headed the REA from 2014 to 2019 before being promoted to a deputy energy minister last year. The committee said on Wednesday that the alleged state funds embezzlement was related to development of a digital system at the REA. 
The energy ministry said in a statement that it will provide investigators with full assistance while declining other comments.

Trump thanked the Omani leader for his statements of support following a U.S.-brokered agreement by the United Arab Emirates and Israel to normalize relations, the White House said.
""President Trump highlighted the importance of the United States-brokered Abraham Accords announced on August 13th and thanked the Sultan for Oman’s comments in support of the Israel-United Arab Emirates deal,"" the statement said. 
Oman has been mentioned by Israeli officials as another country that could follow the UAE lead in normalizing ties with Israel, but there was no mention of that in the White House statement.
White House adviser Jared Kushner last week said he hoped another Arab country would normalize ties with Israel within months.
Israel's neighbors Egypt and Jordan reached peace deals with it decades ago, but other Arab states have long held the position that Israel must agree to give more land to the Palestinians for a state before ties can be normalized.

The United States and Oman have a free trade agreement that entered into force in 2009. Trade in goods and services between the two countries totaled an estimated $4.4 billion in 2018, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's office.

Cuomo said the restrictions will include mandatory temperature checks at the door and requiring one member of each party to provide contact information for contact tracing should there be a COVID-19 outbreak originating from a restaurant.
The state, which has refrained from reopening restaurants in New York City due to concerns it would spread the novel coronavirus, could lift capacity to 50% by a reassessment deadline of Nov. 1 depending on infection rates, Cuomo said.
The governor told a news conference that the state would establish a whistleblowing system whereby patrons can anonymously report restaurants not in compliance by sending a text. 
""New Yorkers themselves will help with compliance,"" Cuomo said. ""New Yorkers will keep new Yorkers safe.""
In a statement New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio acknowledged that dining at 25% capacity will not mark a full return to normal but characterized it as a starting point and a way to lift the city's economy.

""We are continuing New York City’s economic recovery by bringing back indoor dining,"" de Blasio said. ""This may not look like the indoor dining that we all know and love, but it is progress for restaurant workers and all New Yorkers.""

COLUMBUS, Ga. (Reuters) - In Columbus, Georgia, a city of just under 200,000 people near the U.S. Army's sprawling Fort Benning, many residents remain reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump after media reports that he called American war dead ""losers"" and ""suckers.""
""We don't talk about that around here,"" said Donnell Brown, 66, who expressed pride in his daughter, a U.S. Army officer. ""He says so many things, we let it go. He's doing a great job.""
Columbus draws its social and economic lifeblood from the 120,000 active-duty soldiers, reservists and civilian workers at the base, with many of the city's residents strongly supporting the Republican president. Interviews with some locals indicated that Trump's reported remarks would not dissuade them from voting for him as he seeks re-election on Nov. 3.
""Does it sound like something he'd say? Yes,"" said Zachary Edwards, 30, owner of Edwards Military Supply who served two years in the Army. ""Does it matter? No. We're a military town and we support our commander, no matter what. I will be voting for Trump and so will everyone.""
Military veterans and current service members represent a key voting bloc for Trump. 
The president, who often lauds U.S. troops even as he criticizes the military leadership, has denied that he made the comments reported by The Atlantic and other news outlets regarding American war dead. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said that if true the remarks show Trump ""is not fit to do the job of president, to be the commander in chief.""
Trump won Georgia in the 2016 presidential election. A repeat victory seems crucial for his re-election chances. Georgia has not backed a Democratic candidate for president since 1992. 
Bill Davenport, a retired 23-year U.S. Air Force veteran who was splitting oak logs at a local trailer park in Columbus, said Trump's support of the military was undeniable and that he would vote for him in the election.
""He's been pouring money into the military like no one else. Of course he cares,"" Davenport said. ""What he said - a slip of the tongue. He didn't mean it.""
At L.A. Cutz barber shop, owner Kevin Williams (NYSE:WMB), a U.S. Army veteran who served three tours of duty in Iraq, was one of the few willing to publicly criticize Trump.
""That sounds exactly like what he would say,"" Williams, 38, said. ""He will not be getting my vote. He has no respect for the soldier."" 
At the roadside restaurant Taco el Paisa, a retired staff sergeant named Anthony who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan said Trump's reported comments have rattled the base and the city where almost every shop caters to service members. He declined to give his last name because he works for the military as a civilian contractor.
""A lot of my men are still in the service and we talk about this. It's rolled through the base like a tremor,"" he said. ""They won't say anything in public. They're wired to follow the chain of command. But privately, he is losing votes. This is costing him if he knows it or not.""

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbia suspended military drills with foreign troops for six months on Wednesday, halting planned joint exercises with Russia in protest-hit Belarus, after what the government termed pressure from the European Union. 
Defence Minister Aleksandar Vulin said Serbia was facing ""enormous and undeserved"" pressure from Brussels, according to state news agency Tanjug. ""They asked us to leave the planned military exercise with Belarus,"" he was quoted as saying.
Belarus has been rocked by mass protests since there-election of veteran President Alexander Lukashenko in an Aug.9 election his opponents say was rigged.
Lukashenko has looked to Moscow to help with domestic security and to offset Western antagonism towards him.
Serbia's suspension of drills with foreign troops, including also those from China and the trans-Atlantic NATO alliance, would help maintain its military neutrality, Vulin said. 
Belarusian, Russian and Serbian military forces had been due to hold manoeuvres together from Sept. 10-15.
Serbia is performing a delicate balancing act between its ambition to join the EU and its traditional ties with Russia and China who support its refusal to recognise the independence of its former southern province Kosovo.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia summoned Germany's ambassador on Wednesday to accuse Berlin of using the case of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to discredit Moscow and demanded that Germany immediately hand over medical data about his illness.
Navalny, an opponent of President Vladimir Putin, was airlifted to Berlin for treatment after falling ill in Russia.
Germany says he was poisoned with a rare nerve agent, but Moscow says it has seen no solid evidence of that in a case prompting Western calls for new sanctions on Moscow.
""A strong protest was made to the ambassador in connection with Germany's unfounded accusations and ultimatums ... as well as Berlin's obvious use of the situation to discredit our country on the international stage,"" Russia's foreign ministry said.
Moscow, it added, told the German envoy that Russia expected a response to an Aug. 27 request for information including all medical data, biomaterials, examination results and test samples to be studied and verified.
German government vice-spokeswoman Martina Fietz said it had done everything necessary to help answer Russian requests and Navalny's case was now a matter for the judiciary.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier that Russia would need to see proper medical information indicating Navalny was poisoned before Moscow could open an investigation. 
Navalny's lawyer told German television station SWR that Russia was actively preventing an investigation. Vyacheslav Grimaldi added that he would take the case to the European Court of Human Rights should legal avenues in Russia be exhausted. 

The German ambassador to Moscow spent around two hours inside the foreign ministry before leaving without making any comments to reporters.

Roettgen, a foreign policy expert, is an outsider in the race to succeed Merkel, though he has raised his profile by calling for ""hard politics"" with Russia in response to the alleged poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
Merkel, in power since 2005, has said she will not seek re-election in federal elections due by October next year.
""I claim to want to become chancellor and to be able to do so,"" Roettgen told business daily Handelsblatt.
But he added that the conservative alliance of the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), dubbed ""the Union"", must have the best possible line-up.
""The CDU leader must want the candidacy for chancellor. But he must also be humble enough to do what is best for the party. He must decide on this together with the CSU chairman,"" he said.
The CDU plans to choose a new leader at a Dec. 3-5 congress. The party could, in theory, elect a new leader but choose Markus Soeder, the CSU chairman and Bavarian premier, as the Union's chancellor candidate.
Roettgen wanted the personnel questions resolved this year.
An infratest dimap poll for broadcaster ARD published last week showed Roettgen ranked as German voters' fourth choice to run as the Union's chancellor candidate, behind Soeder, erstwhile Merkel rival Friedrich Merz, and Armin Laschet, premier of the most populous state North Rhine-Westphalia.

No chancellor has ever come from the CSU, although Franz Josef Strauss and Edmund Stoiber of the CSU were the Union candidates in the 1980 and 2002 federal elections, respectively, which were both won by the Social Democrats.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Twenty-six scientists, most of them working at universities in Italy, have signed an open letter questioning the reliability of the data presented in the early-stage trial results of the Russian COVID-19 vaccine, named ""Sputnik-V"". 
Addressing the editor of The Lancet, the international peer-reviewed medical journal in which Moscow's Gamaleya Institute published its early-stage trial results, the scientists said they saw patterns in the data that looked ""highly unlikely"".
The letter, published on the personal blog page of one of the signatories, said the Phase I/II trial results data showed multiple participants reporting identical antibody levels.
""On the ground of simple probabilistic evaluations the fact of observing so many data points preserved among different experiments is highly unlikely,"" the open letter said.
However, the scientists said they were basing their conclusions on summaries of the Russian trial result data, published in the journal, rather than the original data itself.
""In lack of the original numerical data, no conclusions can be definitively drawn on the reliability of the data presented, especially regarding the apparent duplications detected,"" the letter said. 
The Gamaleya Institute, which developed the vaccine, rejected the critique. 
""The published results are authentic and accurate and were examined by five reviewers at The Lancet,"" Denis Logunov, a deputy director at the institute, said in a statement.
He said his institute submitted the entire body of raw data on the trial results to The Lancet. 
""We presented specifically the data that was produced (by the trial), not the data that is supposed to please Italian experts,"" Logunov said. 
Naor Bar-Zeev, deputy director at John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who peer reviewed the Russian data, defended his analysis of the research. 
""Science must maintain a balance between incredulity, skepticism and trust. That trust is borne out through plausibility, repeatability and falsifiability.""
""The results are plausible, and not very different to those seen with other AdV vectored products,"" he said.
The researchers had provided more detail than was needed for the review and responded to his questions ""intelligently and in a matter-of-fact and confident but understated manner"".
""Bottom line, I saw no reason to doubt the legitimacy of these results over others I have read and reviewed. But of course one can never know,"" he said in an email.
A spokeswoman for the Lancet said the journal had invited the study's authors to respond to the questions raised in the open letter. It was following the situation closely, she said.
Russia published results on Friday of its Phase I/II trial, which included 76 participants and was conducted in June-July this year. Participants developed a positive immune response and no serious side effects, the study's authors said.
A Phase III trial, involving 40,000 participants, was launched on Aug. 26. Around 31,000 people have already subscribed to take part, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said.

The United States expanded sanctions related to Lebanon on Tuesday by blacklisting two former government ministers, including Amal's Ali Hassan Khalil. It said the two men had aided Hezbollah, which Washington brands a terrorist group.
Hezbollah condemned the move and said the U.S. sanctions policy would not achieve Washington's goals in Lebanon, adding in a statement that it would stand by the two men.
Meanwhile, Lebanon's President Michel Aoun requested the country's caretaker foreign minister make contact with the U.S. ""in order to understand the circumstances"" behind the decision.
Alongside the heavily armed, Iran-backed Hezbollah, Amal is one of two dominant Shi'ite factions in Lebanon's fractious sectarian political system. 
The U.S. move comes at a sensitive time, as a new government is being formed under a tight deadline in a bid to extricate Lebanon from a deep economic crisis that poses the biggest threat to the country's stability since the 1975-1990 civil war. 
""This (U.S.) decision will not change our convictions and our national and patriotic principles at all,"" Amal said in a statement issued after Washington added the senior Amal politician and former finance minister, Khalil, to a blacklist.
The group said imposing sanctions on Khalil was like ""targeting Lebanon and its sovereignty.""
The United States also blacklisted former Transport Minister Yusuf Finyanus, a Christian politician who is a member of the Marada party that is also allied to Hezbollah.
Marada's leader, Suleiman Frangieh, said his party would not be influenced by Washington's decision, the Lebanese state news agency reported. [D5N2BX00I]
In a statement, Frangieh said Washington's move to impose sanctions on Finyanus was a ""political decision"" that would reinforce ""our approach and our position.""
Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib, named after the last government quit following a massive Beirut port blast in August, is seeking to form a cabinet by early next week, under pressure from France which is leading an international push for deep reforms to unlock pledges of aid.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Fires in Brazil's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest worsened in the first week of September and are increasingly spreading into areas of untouched forest, satellite data showed as of Wednesday, after the number of fires likely reached a 10-year high in August.
Brazil reported 8,373 fires in its portion of the Amazon rainforest for the first seven days of September, more than double the number of fires in the same period a year-ago, according to data from Brazil's national space research agency Inpe. 
A pressing concern is that 27% of the major fires so far in September have been in virgin forest, rather than in recently deforested areas or farmland where blazes are more contained, according to an analysis of satellite images by U.S.-based non-profit Amazon Conservation, reviewed exclusively by Reuters.
That's up from 13% in August.
""It's much more of this uncontrolled fire scenario that's just being unleashed,"" said Matt Finer, who leads the non-profit's fire tracking project. 
""These fires, we have no idea where it's going to go, when it's going to stop and as the dry season intensifies, it's just going to get worse."" 
Considering all types of fires, September has already averaged 53 major blazes per day in the first week, up from 18 a day in August, according to Amazon Conservation. 
Amazon Conservation defines major fires as those that emit enough smoke to indicate a large amount of biomass is burning, whereas Inpe's data is based on heat points, which also detect smaller fires.
The Inpe figure showing fires doubled may be an underestimate because an issue with a NASA satellite caused partial data to be reported until Sept. 2, although the issue has been resolved in subsequent days, according to NASA and Inpe.

Revised Inpe data is expected to show fires increased to a 10-year high for August, even worse than the same month last year when Amazon fires provoked global outcry.

LA BOQUILLA DAM, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexicans in the drought-hit northern border state of Chihuahua, angry at water from a local dam being diverted to the United States, hurled Molotov cocktails and rocks at security troops late on Tuesday, in an attempt to force them to shut the dam gates.
The violence at the La Boquilla dam comes amid plans to divert additional water to the United States due to the so-called 'water debt' Mexico has accumulated as part of a bilateral treaty that regulates water sharing between the neighbors.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, seeking to assuage the concerns of Mexican farmers, has struggled to avoid alienating voters in the north while protecting delicate relations with the United States.
A Reuters witness said groups of residents in towns surrounding the La Boquilla dam clashed with National Guard troops after they refused to turn off the dam floodgates. 
The residents lobbed Molotov cocktails, rocks and sticks at the security forces, who were clad in riot gear and retaliated with tear gas, the witness said and images show. Eventually, the protesters stormed the dam premises and shut the floodgates themselves.
""For us, it is a great satisfaction, something to be proud of, (and) a triumph for the people in rescuing the water,"" said Abel Alvarado Martinez, an owner of a bakery in a nearby town, who was at the protests.
The interior ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Several other demonstrations have turned violent over water sharing with the United States this year, with Mexican farmers warning the drought means Mexico should not divert any water right now.
Lopez Obrador last week suggested the United Nations could be asked to analyze water allocation plans, and asked the Chihuahua people to trust he would not leave them without water.
He also warned Mexico faced ""sanctions"" if it did not divert water after building up a deficit in recent years by receiving more water than it has given back. ""Do not forget that there are elections in the United States,"" Lopez Obrador said.
But the protesters say they are more focused on water shortages killing crops than diplomatic cordiality.

""I agree with international treaties, they must be respected,"" said Alvarado Martinez. ""But if we do not have what they require, how are we going to pay?""

David Schenker, the department's top diplomat for the Middle East, was quick to urge caution however, because there hasn't been any fundamental shift in talks that would quickly lead to a resolution.
The dispute dates from 2017 when the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a boycott on Qatar, severing diplomatic and transport ties and accusing it of supporting terrorism. Qatar denies allegations of supporting terrorism.
""I don't want to get into the whole diplomacy in it but there is some movement. I would like to say that it's going to be a matter of weeks,"" Schenker told a virtual event by the Washington-based Brookings Institute.
Kuwait and the United States have tried to mediate a rift that has undermined Washington's efforts to form a united front against Iran, which is struggling for regional supremacy with Saudi Arabia.
""There's not been a fundamental shift that ... we're going to push the door open right now, but in our talks we're detecting a little bit more flexibility, so we're hoping we can bring the sides closer together and end this ... distraction,"" he said.

Staff at Htet Khine Soe's Yangon shop are working day and night to print the red shirts, flags and banners of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party as orders pour in, seizing the opportunity as campaigning gets underway.
Htet Khine Soe has had a tough few months, with business grinding to a halt due to social restrictions aimed at keeping the coronavirus at bay.
The election, which Suu Kyi's NLD is expected to win, has provided a badly needed lifeline.
""I can breathe easily now as we had nothing to do in the previous three months,"" said Htet Khine Soe, 33, folding some of the 1,000 shirts he produces each day.
""Our business can get better if orders keep coming in during the election campaign period.""
Myanmar has been spared a major coronavirus crisis, but since mid-August infections have tripled to 1,807, with 12 deaths.
A partial lockdown has been re-imposed in the city of Yangon, schools are closed nationwide and entry to the capital Naypyitaw is restricted - all curbs that could dampen enthusiasm for the vote.

LONDON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is wanted by the United States because he is a ""political enemy"" of President Donald Trump, his London extradition hearing was told on Wednesday.
Australian-born Assange, 49, is fighting against being sent to the United States, where he is charged with conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law over the release of confidential cables by WikiLeaks in 2010-2011.
Paul Rogers (NYSE:ROG), a professor of peace studies at Britain's Bradford University, told London's Old Bailey court that the timing of the U.S. prosecution was connected to Assange's political views and Trump's hostility toward him.
""The evidence does support very strongly ... this does appear to be a political trial,"" Rogers said.
Assange and WikiLeaks enraged the U.S. government a decade ago by publishing thousands of secret American documents, but he was not charged with any criminal offense at the time.
His supporters see him as a champion of free speech exposing abuses of power and hypocrisy by Washington and regard his prosecution as threat to journalism. U.S. authorities say he recklessly endangered the lives of sources with his releases.
Rogers said the Trump administration viewed Assange as a ""political enemy"" because of his opinions. Assange's defense team are arguing the U.S. case is politically-motivated, something which would bar his extradition.
""The opinions and views of Mr Assange, demonstrated in his words and actions with the organization WikiLeaks over many years, can be seen as very clearly placing him in the crosshairs of dispute with the philosophy of the Trump administration,"" Rogers said in his statement to the court.

James Lewis, the lawyer representing the United States, challenged the assertion the case was politically-motivated, saying U.S. federal prosecutors were forbidden to consider political opinion in making their decisions. 
""I'm not saying they are acting in bad faith,"" Rogers said. ""I'm saying that at a different level, a political decision was taken to investigate this further after it had lapsed for eight years."" 
Assange was warned by the judge on Tuesday he would be removed from the courtroom and tried in his absence if he interrupted proceedings after Assange shouting ""nonsense"" at Lewis.

PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union plans to remove an east Libyan powerbroker from its sanctions blacklist to encourage peace efforts and ensure the EU plays a central role in any negotiated settlement, three diplomats said.
After months of inaction, European powers see a chance to reassert their role in Libya, in turmoil since the 2011 fall of Muammar Gaddafi, after a ceasefire in August and to counter growing Turkish and Russian military involvement.
The EU has blacklisted Aguilah Saleh, leader of rebel-held eastern Libya's parliament, since 2016, accused of obstructing peace efforts. But the diplomats said he was now a key figure in a push to bring the two sides of the Libyan conflict together.
Libya's internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) declared the ceasefire last month and called for a lifting of a seven-month blockade on oil facilities. Saleh also appealed for a halt to hostilities.
That was met with rebuke from eastern commander Khalifa Haftar, whose Libyan National Army has been backed by Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, but whose stock has waned after a failed assault on Tripoli following Turkish military support to the GNA.
NO LONGER 'SPOILERS'
With Libya's migration routes close to European shores and its energy supplies, Italy, France and Germany, along with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, want to show unity and defend interests on their southern doorstep.
""There's a window of opportunity now for the EU to move. Borrell is pressing EU states to realize just how close and how important Libya is,"" one EU diplomat said.
According to the diplomats, EU states are working to remove the travel bans and asset freezes on Saleh and also on Nouri Abusahmain, president of Libya' s General National Congress in Tripoli, one of two rival parliaments, and Khalifa al-Ghwell, prime minister of the Tripoli government.
""We are heading towards a delisting of Saleh. It enables us to send a signal to 'spoilers' because frankly everybody is talking to him,"" a second EU diplomat said.
Jalel Harchaoui at the Clingendael Institute said there was a consensus that Haftar's time had passed and Russia and Egypt had sought to bring Saleh to the diplomatic fore.
""Given that reality, other nations, including Europeans, are now joining the bandwagon. It is important to have one or more interlocutors that are not Haftar or his sons,"" he said. 
The senior figures could first see a freeze of the sanctions, or the sanctions, which come up for renewal in October, could be extended for a limited period.
The bloc has also agreed in principle to add sanctions on two Libyan individuals and three Libyan companies, including those linked to the maritime and aviation sector, as part of efforts to enforce a U.N. arms embargo.

Final agreement could come later this month, although EU governments must overcome delays from Cyprus, which is holding up all sanctions approval until the EU agrees a tougher line on Turkey in a dispute over energy resources in the Eastern Mediterranean. Sanctions need all 27 EU states to agree.

More than half a million people died during the 1936-39 civil war and an estimated 150,000 were killed by Franco's regime, while 450,000 were forced to leave Spain, historians estimate.
But public opinion is still divided over the legacy of the dictatorship that ended with Franco's death in 1975. 
""We will ban and make illegal the foundations that defend the Francoist dictatorship, like, for instance, the Francisco Franco foundation,"" Sanchez told lawmakers on Wednesday.
The Francisco Franco foundation's president, Juan Chicharro Ortega, said the ban would be a violation of the constitution. 
""That law is nothing but an attempt to divert Spanish people's attention from the government's disastrous handling of the (coronavirus) pandemic and the thousands of deaths,"" he told Reuters.
Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo had said on Tuesday that the bill would ban glorification of the dictatorship by public or publicly-funded institutions.
Chicharro Ortega insisted the foundation, which was founded in 1976 by sympathizers after Franco's death, doesn't receive any public funding and is only financed by donations. 
Sanchez' government has taken a series of steps to remove dictatorship-era symbols, including last year removing Franco's remains from a massive mausoleum near Madrid he had built for himself in a place called ""The Valley of the Fallen"".
The 'democratic memory' bill also intends to finance the exhumation of the bodies of victims of war and the dictatorship buried in mass graves, Calvo told reporters.

Last week, a court ruled in favor of the government in a dispute against the late dictator's heirs over the ownership of a palace in the northern region of Galicia.

The August 1982 bombing and shooting assault on the Jo Goldenberg restaurant killed six people and wounded at least 20. 
In 2015, arrest warrants were issued against three former members of the Abu Nidal Organization, a splinter group of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), a source told Reuters at the time.
One of the men lives in Norway, where he immigrated in the 1990s, but Norwegian authorities rejected the original 2015 request on grounds that, in most cases, it would not extradite its own citizens.
The man, now in his 60s, has previously denied any involvement in the case, according to Norwegian daily Dagbladet, which first reported his arrest. In 2015, he told Norwegian daily VG he had never been to Paris.
The suspects were identified long after the attacks because of statements from other former members of the Abu Nidal group using a French judicial process that maintained their anonymity, the source said.
Norway recently adopted new pan-European regulations on arrests, leading French prosecutors to seek extradition for a second time.
A legal process in Norway will determine whether formal grounds have been met for extradition. If he is tried, any judgment will be by a French court.
""We were contacted this morning after the arrest by the PST,"" said the man's lawyer, Kenneth Meland. ""I've not yet had the opportunity to speak to him myself.""
Meland's law firm also represented the suspect in 2015.
The attack at the Jo Goldenberg restaurant was at the time the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in France since World War Two, and was part of a wave of violence involving Palestinian militants.

PARIS (Reuters) - A survivor of the 2015 attack on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo told a French court on Wednesday how the gunmen said ""Allahu akbar"" (""God is greatest""), then shot him with their Kalashnikov rifles.
Simon Fieschi was the first employee the two gunmen encountered when they entered the magazine's Paris offices. He said that after being shot he lost consciousness, and the gunmen moved on to other targets.
""It was all very quick for me,"" said Fieschi, 36, who limped to the witness box using a crutch but declined an offer to take a seat, saying he preferred to testify standing.
""I remember the door opening violently, and gunshots. I remember a man who said: 'Allahu akbar,' and then, 'We don't kill women',"" said Fieschi, who was in charge of the magazine's digital platforms.
""I lost consciousness, which is without doubt what saved my life,"" he said. One bullet went into his neck and damaged his spinal column, leaving him with constant pain and reduced mobility.
Fieschi was speaking in the second week of a trial of 14 alleged accomplices of the Islamist gunmen who targeted French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket, killing 17 people. The gunmen themselves are dead.
The magazine was targeted by Islamist radicals, according to prosecutors, because it had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad. Depictions of the prophet are considered blasphemous by Muslims.
On the day of the attack, when Fieschi regained consciousness, the shooting had already finished and many of his colleagues lay dead, or wounded. It was not until much later that he was told what had happened to his co-workers.
""The image that stays with me is of a trail of blood in the corridor leading to the newsroom,"" he said in court. ""At the time I didn't really understand what it meant.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - The Houthi administration in Yemen has suspended all United Nations and humanitarian flights to the capital Sanaa as its Saudi-led coalition foe blocks commercial vessels in the Red Sea port of Hodeidah.
The Iran-aligned Houthis took over Sanaa and most cities in 2014 after ousting the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The ensuing war has led to a major humanitarian crisis.
Since then, only U.N. and humanitarian flights have been allowed by the coalition, which controls Yemeni airspace, to land at the capital's airport.
The decision, which the Houthis blamed on a fuel shortage, comes as the coalition holds 21 commercial vessels in Hodeidah port, preventing more than 500,000 tonnes of fuel from entering the country. 
The group said the suspension took effect on Wednesday.
""Our inventories are very scarce...we have been waiting for three months, now we have reached a dangerous level,"" said Khaled al-Shayef, managing director of Sanaa airport.
""We have informed the U.N....but we haven't heard from them so far.""
The Houthi foreign ministry sent a letter on Aug. 30 to the United Nations saying that for the airport to continue servicing its flights, the organization must provide the airport with 30,000 liters of diesel, 15,000 liters of petrol and 3,000 liters of fuel oil for other equipment, sources familiar with the matter said.
U.N. officials think the airport needs less than half of that amount of fuel, U.N. sources said.
""They are using the humanitarian response as an instrument.. They know we can't have the airport closed, so they want us to pressure the coalition,"" said a U.N. official who declined to be named. 
Houthi officials could not be reached for further comment, but the group has blamed the Saudi-led coalition of waging economic warfare on Houthi-held territories by holding U.N.-cleared commercial vessels in Hodeidah port. 
The contested Red Sea city is the entry point for more than 70% of Yemen's imports of commercial goods and aid.
As of Sept. 3, 21 vessels have been cleared by the Djibouti-based U.N. Verification and Inspection Mechanism but held by coalition warships stationed off Hodeidah. 
The vessels carry a total of 525,000 tonnes of oil products including diesel, gasoline and liquefied natural gas, U.N. sources said. The coalition did not respond to a request for comment
The Western-backed coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 to try to restore Hadi's government to power but the war, which has killed 100,000 people, has been in stalemate for years.
In Sanaa, dozens of cars formed long queues where drivers could wait for up to 48 hours. Fuel rationing imposed by authorities restrict private cars to a maximum of 40 liters of gasoline per week.
""We are enduring severe hardship. I have been queuing since yesterday and my turn hasn't arrived yet and the ration is not enough anyway,"" said Hassan al-Ghile, a taxi driver. 

""We are calling on politicians, the U.N. and the world to end the blockade on the Yemeni people: Have mercy, have mercy!"" Ghile said.

But a statement released by the Saudi foreign ministry on remarks made by Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud included no direct mention of a normalisation deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.
The prince said Riyadh supported the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war, with East Jerusalem as its capital, according to the statement. During the 1967 war, Israel captured territory including the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which it still occupies.
Announced on Aug. 13, the UAE-Israel accord was the first such accommodation between an Arab country and Israel in more than 20 years, and was forged largely through shared fears of Iran.
In comments about the UAE at the Arab League meeting in Cairo, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki referred to the accord as a ""surprise"", ""a normalisation"" and an ""earthquake"" that hit Arab consensus.
But he avoided strong words such as ""betrayal"" that were used by Palestinian leaders in the immediate aftermath of the announcement.
Maliki used tougher language against Israel, referring to ""colonial and racist occupation"", and accused the United States of blackmail, pressure and assault against Palestinians and some Arab states.

Maliki voiced dismay at the lack of Arab consensus that prevented an emergency Arab summit being held at the Palestinians' request following the Aug. 13, announcement. He called for an immediate rejection of the accord before the signing ceremony planned at the White House next week.

Last month, Reuters reported that the United States was expected to reduce its troops presence in Iraq by about a third.
The United States has around 5,200 troops that were deployed in Iraq to fight the Islamic State militant group. Officials in the U.S.-led coalition say Iraqi forces are now mostly able to handle the remnants of Islamic State on their own.
""We are continuing to expand on our partner capacity programs that enable Iraqi forces and allow us to reduce our footprint in Iraq,"" Marine General Frank McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command, said during a visit to Iraq. 
A senior administration official had said on Tuesday that President Donald Trump would be announcing a reduction of U.S. troops from Iraq.
The United States and Iraq in June affirmed their commitment to the reduction of U.S. troops in the country in coming months, with no plans by Washington to maintain permanent bases or a permanent military presence.
In 2016 Trump campaigned on ending America's “endless wars,” but U.S. troops remain in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, albeit in smaller numbers.
Last month during a meeting with the Iraqi prime minister, Trump redoubled his promise to withdraw the U.S. troops still in Iraq.
Trump's meeting with the Iraqi leader came amid a new spike in tensions between Washington and Tehran after Washington said it would seek to reinstate all previously suspended U.S. sanctions on Iran at the United Nations.

Iraq's parliament had voted earlier this year for the departure of foreign troops from Iraq, and United States and other coalition troops have been leaving as part of a drawdown.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian and Chinese troops were facing off on Wednesday, barely a few hundred meters apart, in a remote Himalayan region where shots were fired for the first time in decades, Indian officials said.
The nuclear-armed neighbors have accused each other of firing in the air during a fresh flare-up in the Ladakh region on Monday, violating long-standing protocols to avoid using firearms along their undemarcated borders.
""The situation is tense,"" an official in New Delhi said, adding that Indian and Chinese troops were squaring off in close proximity in at least four locations south of the Pangong Tso lake that both lay claim to.
""Both are on their own sides of the LAC,"" the official said, referring to the Line of Actual Control, the de facto border.
At a forward position near the Rezang La mountain pass, Indian and Chinese troops were only around 200 meters apart, another official in New Delhi said. Both officials declined to be named.
On Monday, the Indian military said Chinese troops fired in the air after attempting to close in on a forward Indian position. But the China military said it was Indian troops who fired the shots, threatening Chinese border guards during a patrol.
In photographs provided by sources in New Delhi from an area south of Pangong Tso taken on Monday, around two dozen Chinese troops with assault rifles hanging off their backs can be seen holding long poles with a curved blade. Reuters could not independently verify the photographs.
A 70-km long patch of desolate snow desert south of Pangong Tso has emerged as the latest flash-point between the Asian giants, with some 3,000 Indian troops strung along strategic ridges and hilltops, the first Indian official said.
The confrontation erupted after New Delhi mobilized soldiers late last month to occupy key heights to deter Chinese troops, whose movements suggested they aimed to occupy a hilltop that falls within territory that India considers its own, according to Indian officials.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The toppling of Confederate statues during nationwide protests against racial injustice brought renewed attention to the importance of U.S. public monuments, very few of which were made by Black sculptors.
Empty plinths have stirred debate over who and what should replace the toppled statues. Black sculptors and historians hope the aftermath will give communities around the country a chance to honor often-forgotten African-American trailblazers.
""Space is power. When a Black body in bronze is placed publicly, that story is magnified because of the powerful space,"" said sculptor Dana King of Oakland, California.
""It allows children to look up into the faces of these sculptures and say, 'Who are you? And why are you standing before me?'"" said King, who is set to unveil in September her public sculpture of William Lanson, a formerly enslaved Black man who worked to extend New Haven's Long Wharf, making the Connecticut port competitive with nearby New York. 
Of the more than 5,000 public outdoor sculptures registered in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Art Inventories Catalog, less than a quarter of the roughly 700 works in the ""Ethnic-African American"" category were made by Black sculptors.
Similarly, fewer than half of the 75 U.S. works included in ""Contemporary Monuments to the Slave Past,"" a website run by University of Maryland Professor Renee Ater, were created by Black sculptors. 
""Part of the reason I went into figurative sculpture was to create works of art that represented people who look like me and look like a lot of New Yorkers who I see but I didn't see represented,"" said sculptor Branly Cadet.
Black sculptors bring a perspective that a white artist cannot, added Cadet, whose public statues highlight figures including New York Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr., who fought for pay equity, and star athlete Jackie Robinson, who broke Major League Baseball's color barrier. 
""Statues and monuments reflect who and what we value as a nation,"" University of Pittsburgh historian Keisha Blain said. ""Building a racism-free society requires making an active choice.""
PUSHING PAST BARRIERS
Winning public art commissions is a lengthy, competitive and often controversial process decided by elected officials and influenced by powerbrokers ranging from real estate developers to political clubs.
It took more than a decade of delays and debates for Savannah, Georgia, whose population is 50 percent Black, to unveil in 2002 its first statue acknowledging its history as a major slave port.
Disputes raged over the memorial's graphic inscription about slave ship horrors, as well as about the selected sculptor - a white professor from the prestigious Savannah College of Art and Design.
Cadet's insight into African-American history helped him win a commission for a memorial outside Philadelphia's City Hall honoring Octavius Catto, unveiled in 2017 as the first public monument to an African-American individual in a city where the population is more than 40 percent Black.
Catto had an array of accomplishments, but Cadet was struck by Catto's push to de-segregate horse-drawn trolley cars and to ratify the 15th Amendment to let Black men vote. 
""As an African American, I thought it was critical to highlight those two aspects of his existence,"" said Cadet, 54. 
The killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died in Minneapolis in May after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, has added momentum to a years-long movement to remove Confederate monuments and other U.S. public statues that critics say promote white supremacy and racial violence.
Nationwide, nearly 800 Confederate monuments stand at county courthouses, town squares, state capitols and other public spaces, including 34 memorials dedicated after 2000, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Since June 2015, when white supremacist and Confederate flag enthusiast Dylan Roof gunned down a Bible study group at a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine people, 48 Confederate monuments have been removed, some under public protest, the Law Center said.
Pittsburgh's Blain says that while removing symbols of oppression is vital, memorializing Black lives in public is an important first step in the struggle to build a racism-free society, which ultimately requires concrete changes to laws and public policy.
Some, including sculptor King, say it would be far more meaningful to let the resounding absence of statues in the wake of the protests catch the public's attention.   
""All that space should be left alone for a while,"" said King. 

""We should sit with the raw sense of discomfort from the space left over from those torn down monuments, and the energy they left behind.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Weapons provided by Western powers and Iran to the warring sides in Yemen are fuelling the six-year-old conflict, marked by deadly Saudi-led coalition air strikes and Houthi shelling, U.N. investigators said on Wednesday.
Coalition air strikes in the past year may amount to war crimes, while the Iran-aligned Houthi movement carried out killings and other abuses that may also constitute war crimes, they said.
It was the third successive year that the panel of independent experts found that all parties had violated international law. This year's findings covered incidents from June 2019 to June 2020.
Countries including Britain, Canada, France, Iran and the United States continued their support to the warring sides ""including through arms transfers, thereby helping to perpetuate the conflict"", the U.N. panel said in a report entitled ""Yemen: A Pandemic of Impunity in a Tortured Land"". 
""After years of documenting the terrible toll of this war, no one can say 'we did not know what was happening in Yemen',"" said Kamel Jendoubi, chairman of the Group of Experts.
The three experts urged the U.N. Security Council to refer the situation in Yemen to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for possible prosecutions.
The Saudi-led Sunni Muslim coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Houthis ousted the internationally recognized government from power in the capital, Sanaa, in 2014. 
The conflict is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and its regional foe, Shi'ite Muslim Iran. More than 100,000 people have been killed and millions are on the brink of famine, aid agencies say. 
""During this reporting period, the Group verified a further four airstrikes or series of airstrikes involving similar failures to take all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian objects,"" the report said of the coalition backing the government of Yemen's exiled president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
""Disproportionate attacks constitute war crimes under customary international law,"" it said.
They included ""one of the deadliest airstrikes of 2020"", launched by the coalition on Feb. 15 on a village in the Al-Hayjah area of Al-Jawf province, ""resulting in approximately 50 civilians killed and injured,"" it said.
""The coalition's restrictions on imports and access to Al-Hudaydah (Hodeidah) port have contributed to shortages of fuel and other necessities and to inflation, thereby exacerbating the economic and humanitarian crisis,"" the U.N. panel said.
Mortar bombs fired by the Houthis hit a central prison in the frontline city of Taiz in April, killing six women and two girls, according to the report, which said it could constitute a war crime.

Health Minister Adam Vojtech announced the measure on Wednesday after his ministry reported a one-day spike in COVID-19 infections of 1,164, while neighbouring Germany, a country almost eight times larger in population, had 1,176.
""Due to the worsening epidemiological situation... we agreed with experts that we will implement compulsory wearing of face masks indoors across the Czech Republic as of tomorrow,"" he said, adding the ministry would give details later in the day.
While the Czech Republic was among the first European countries to adopt mask wearing at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, rules have largely been relaxed since then.
The capital Prague had already tightened measures after a spike in the number of cases, making the wearing of masks compulsory on public transport and ordering all bars to close by midnight.
The daily tally of new cases across the country of 10.7 million people has mostly exceeded 500 so far this month, well above a daily peak of 377 in March during the first wave of infections.
Interactive graphic on new coronavirus cases in Czech Republic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/qzjvqewdqvx/index.html 
Czech authorities, which were quick to impose a strict lockdown in March to halt the spread of the virus, want to avoid costly restrictions again after the economy shrank by 11% in the April-June period on an annual basis.
The Czech spike in COVID-19 infections in the last two weeks has been among the fastest in Europe, outpaced only by Spain, France, Malta, Romania and Croatia, said the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
The Czech pace of 61.4 cases per 100,000 people is roughly three times that of Germany.
However, the death toll has remained lower than in many other European countries, with 441 fatalities reported as of Wednesday out of a total of 29,877 cases.

Hospitalisations have risen in the past week but remain below this year's peaks. The government says many new cases are asymptomatic and among the younger population.

Georgia reported 44 new cases of the virus on Wednesday, bringing its total to 1,773. The ex-Soviet republic of 3.7 million people has reported 19 deaths, far fewer than other countries in the South Caucasus region.
But as case numbers have risen it has banned weddings, birthdays and other parties as well as funeral dinners, both indoors and in open-air spaces, Natia Mezvrishvili, the government administration head, told a briefing.
She said the planned re-opening of theaters, cinemas and entertainment centers had been postponed for a month to Nov. 1.
""We urge citizens to observe the rules as much as possible, show high civic responsibility, wear masks and maintain social distancing,"" Mezvrishvili said.
Georgia has lifted most restrictions it imposed to contain COVID-19, reopening shops, hotels, restaurants and cafes, and it revived public and inter-city transport in June.

Sudan's government said it had allocated more than 150 million Sudanese pounds ($2.73 million) to help flood victims, the state news agency said.
The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said that with the help of the United Arab Emirates it had flown 100 metric tonnes of relief material including blankets, which will be distributed across 12 states.
The floods have left at least 102 people dead in the country and destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of homes, according to the interior ministry. Authorities have declared a three-month state of emergency.
Standing by tents in south Khartoum, Idris Ahmed, who lost his home, said the government was not giving enough support. ""They are not helping, not doing anything,"" he said.
""I, as a citizen, am asking for my citizen's rights, am looking for refuge.""
Residents packed into boats to check on their houses as parts of the capital Khartoum such as Toti island at the confluence of the White and Blue Nile were submerged.

The Open Russia group financed by Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky said the police searches were taking place as part of an old criminal investigation into Yukos, a defunct oil giant once owned by Khodorkovsky. 
Some opposition activists have joined forces to compete in local elections across Russia on Sunday as part of a group called the United Democrats, hoping to get a toehold in regional politics that is dominated by the United Russia ruling party. 
Police carried out searches at the group's offices as well as at the homes of seven people in the regions of Vladimir, Ivanovo and Tatarstan who are either competing at the elections or helping with the campaigns, Open Russia said. 
Police also searched the editorial office in Moscow of MBKh, a media outlet financed by Khodorkovsky, it said. 
""It's obvious the independent candidates and United Democrats' offices are not linked to Yukos, this is an act of pressure and lawlessness from the state in United Russia's interest..."" said Anastasiya Burakova, an Open Russia activist. 
On Tuesday, an ally of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny running for the city council in the city of Novosibirsk said an assailant had burst into his group's campaign office and smashed a bottle containing a chemical fluid on the floor.
Russia's treatment of President Vladimir Putin's political opponents has come under international scrutiny since Navalny was airlifted to Germany last month for treatment for what German medics say was poisoning with a rare nerve agent. Russia has said it has seen no solid evidence that he was poisoned.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia has revoked the visas of two visiting Chinese academics in an apparent escalation of tension between the countries which has seen each accuse the other of inappropriate treatment of journalists.
Chen Hong, a professor of Australian Studies at East China Normal University in Shanghai, said in an email to Reuters that he had received a letter from Australia's Home Affairs Department cancelling his visa. The letter said he had been deemed by security body ASIO to pose a threat to national security.
""I absolutely refuse to accept this assessment, and believe a gross mistake has been made regarding my relationship with Australia,"" Chen said in the email. ""I have done nothing and will do nothing to act as a risk to Australia's security.""
Australian Broadcasting Corp reported that another scholar, Li Jianjun, had received a similar letter. Li could not immediately be reached for comment.
The move intensifies a round of recriminations between the countries that has involved reports of Australian journalists in China being questioned by police, prompting them to leave the country, and of Australian authorities raiding the homes of Chinese media representatives there. 
A spokesman for Australian National University, where Li was named this year as a visiting scholar, said he finished his appointment there in February. The Department of Home Affairs and ASIO were also not immediately available for comment.
Australia has a tense diplomatic relationship with China, which worsened this year after Beijing vowed trade reprisals and said it was angered by Australia's call for an international inquiry into the source of the coronavirus pandemic.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The leader of the Japanese ruling coalition's junior partner, Komeito, indicated on Wednesday his party does not want a snap general election after the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) picks a new leader to succeed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
""The top priority is dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. People want to get back to business and return to work, and I don't believe they want a power vacuum of a month or two that would result from calling an election,"" Natsuo Yamaguchi told Reuters in an interview.
Komeito, backed by Japan's largest Buddhist lay group, provides crucial election support to the ruling party by encouraging its members to campaign for LDP candidates. 
Without its backing, the next LDP leader, who by dint of the LDP's parliamentary majority is almost certain of becoming prime minister, is unlikely to dissolve the assembly.
Yamaguchi's comments come amid speculation that the front runner to win the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP's) leadership election on Sept. 14, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, could call a snap election.
Suga has said his priority is dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, but he signalled there was a chance of calling a snap election in an interview published by the Asahi newspaper. 
An early election could heighten expectations the government would lay out additional pandemic spending measures to appeal to voters.
Data released on Tuesday showed Japan's economy sank deeper into its worst post-war contraction in the second quarter, underscoring the challenges the next prime minister faces in dealing with COVID-19.
""Komeito has strongly argued that the top priority is to halt the coronavirus and to revive social and economic activity,"" Yamaguchi said.
STRIKE DETERRENCE
The Komeito leader also questioned whether Japan needed strike weapons to deter North Korea or other adversaries from launching missile or air attacks on Japan.
This is a major policy change and requires public discussion and consensus building. None of that has started yet,” said Yamaguchi. ""This is something that has to be though about seriously under the next prime minister,"" he added. 
Before announcing he would step down because of illness, Abe asked his National Security Council (NSC) to look at ways Japan could bolster it defences, including a proposal from the LDP for the country to consider strike weapons that could target enemy bases.

The NSC was due to provide an outline of those discussions this month, followed by a plan for national security changes by the end of the year.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Outside her home in the Lagos slum of Makoko, Esther Ikechukwu stacks two upturned buckets, places a handbag on top and rests a tablet against it. Her balancing act finished, the desk and the 17-year-old are ready for school.
The coronavirus pandemic shut Nigeria's schools in March. Already with more children out of education than any other country, 13 million according to the United Nations, the virus threatens even more futures.
Most at risk are those like Esther, growing up in Nigeria's slums with few social safety nets.
Authorities say schools could soon begin a phased reopening, but organisations like Slum2School have tried to fill the void. It is a Lagos-based charity working across Africa to educate children growing up in poorer communities. 
Since July, it has given tablets and laptops to teachers and pupils in the Makoko slum for live remote lessons - normally an unaffordable solution for the children.
Esther, who received a tablet and headset from the charity, said she had missed attending school until the charity stepped in. 
""I am not really missing (out),"" she said, adding that she was now in a better position than some other youngsters. 
With 30 teachers, Slum2School educated almost 1,000 children. It is targeting 10,000 students by year-end.
But the slum's lack of power means difficulty charging electronics. Esther's outdoor desk is a solution for the weak mobile signal indoors - she juggles between video and audio as the network drops.
Slum2School tries to combat the electricity problems by providing power banks and solar charging kiosks.
Long school breaks can cut children out of education as they are pushed to support poor families with menial work, said Otto Orondaam, the charity's founder.

""This is just another way to keep them learning,"" he said.

""Today, once again the enemy of Afghanistan tried to harm Saleh, but they failed in their evil aim, and Saleh escaped the attack unharmed,"" Razwan Murad, a spokesman for Saleh's office, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
He told Reuters the bomb targeted Saleh's convoy and some of his bodyguards were injured.
Saleh appeared in a video on his social media accounts soon after, saying he had sustained a minor burn on his face and an injury to his hand in the attack.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a post on Twitter that Taliban fighters were not involved in the blast.
The former intelligence chief and the senior of President Ashraf Ghani's two vice-presidents, has survived several assassination attempts, including one on his office last year that killed 20 people. 
Wednesday's blast killed at least 10 civilians and wounded 15 people including Saleh's security guards, according to the interior ministry.
""Such attacks won't weaken our resolve for a lasting and dignified peace in Afghanistan,"" Javid Faisal, spokesman for the National Security Council, said in a tweet. 
International powers including the European Union and Pakistan also condemned the attack. 
""This is an attack on the Republic, & desperate act by spoilers of peace efforts, who must be collectively confronted,"" the EU Delegation in Afghanistan said in a statement on Twitter.

Officials and diplomats have warned that rising violence is sapping trust needed for the success of talks aimed at ending an insurgency that began when the Taliban was ousted from power in Kabul by U.S.-back forces in late 2001.

Nord Stream 2, an underwater pipeline to bring gas from Russia to Germany, is 90% complete and is due to start operation next year. But German politicians have suggested they could withhold support after the suspected poisoning of Alexei Navalny, a leading Kremlin critic now being treated in Germany.
Germany is consulting European and NATO partners on how to respond if Russia fails to help explain the case of Navalny, who German doctors say was poisoned with a rare nerve agent. Russia says it has seen no evidence he was poisoned.
""This reaction should lead, first of all, to the stoppage of work on the Nord Stream 2, which strengthens Russia's power, helps President Putin to build a military power, helps to intimidate other nations,"" Morawiecki told public radio.
""We have Germany on our western border without which this project does not make sense ... I call on them to see what is happening in Belarus, what is happening in Ukraine, how much risk the completion of this project will generate in Ukraine.""
Poland, which imports most of the gas it consumes from Russia, has long opposed Nord Stream 2, arguing it would strengthen Russia's already dominant position on the region's gas market.
The pipeline will double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 and will help Russia bypass Ukraine, the main route for Russian gas. Moscow and Kiev have been at loggerheads since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Inflation is running above 800%, reviving memories of the hardships of more than a decade ago when hyperinflation wiped out savings and pensions.
The Zimbabwe Nurses Association (ZINA), which has more than 16,000 members, called for the strike to force President Emmerson Mnanagwa's government to pay U.S. dollar salaries, but authorities say they are unable to do so. 
The strike by nurses and senior doctors has crippled public hospitals, with non-emergency patients turned away and some babies stillborn due to lack of adequate medical care.
ZINA president Enoch Dongo said nurses wanted to give Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, who was in August appointed health minister, a chance to resolve the dispute.
""When you have a crisis sometimes you need to give people a chance to resolve it. After sometime we will review this decision,"" Dongo told Reuters.
""So we are telling our members to report for work but only if they have transport money and if there is PPE in hospitals.""
Dongo said the lowest paid nurse earned 6,000 Zimbabwe dollars ($73) in salary and allowances monthly. The state statistical agency says an average family of five needs at least 15,573 Zimbabwe dollars to be not considered poor.
Chiwenga has said the government would soon table a pay offer for the health sector and stop paying medical bills for cabinet ministers and senior officials who seek treatment abroad to save on scarce foreign exchange. 

Zimbabweans are growing impatient with Mnangagwa, who promised to revive the economy when he took over from Robert Mugabe after a coup in 2017. Mnangagwa says the economy is being sabotaged the opposition and some Western countries.

Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, has repeatedly complained of Chinese military activities near the island, including regular air force patrols. China says such drills demonstrate its resolve to protect its sovereignty.
China has in the last few weeks mounted numerous exercises up and down its coast and near Taiwan.

DENVER (Reuters) - The U.S. Rockies were bracing for an extreme swing in weather conditions on Tuesday, with forecasters warning of a winter storm bringing heavy snows and damaging winds, a day after the region sweltered through temperatures in the 90s Fahrenheit. 
A blast of cold Canadian air was expected to push through Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and Colorado, bringing with it at least 6 inches (15 cm) of snow and winds gusts of 35 mph (56 kph) throughout the night and into Wednesday, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. 
The cold front follows a long spell of hot, dry weather that plagued the region for the last two months. 
At 6 p.m. local time on Tuesday, the temperature dipped to 36 degrees Fahrenheit (2°C) in Denver, where snow was falling with winds blowing at about 15 mph, a day after Colorado's capital reached 93 degrees Fahrenheit (34°C), the 73th day of temperatures above 90 degrees, tying the city's record. 
""Any average person would see this a couple of times in their life,"" said Evan Direnzo, a NWS meteorologist in Colorado.

(Reuters) - Rochester, New York's police chief abruptly resigned on Tuesday along with his command staff, saying there had been a ""mischaracterization and politicization"" of his actions following the death of Daniel Prude in police custody.
Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren told a City Council meeting that she had not asked Chief La’Ron Singletary to resign, though she said there was ""information that was brought to light today that I have not previously seen before."" She did not elaborate.
Rochester, a city of 200,000 people on Lake Ontario, erupted with protests last week after the Prude family released body camera footage showing officers had used a mesh hood and pinned Prude, a 41-year-old Black man, to the pavement during the March arrest.
The release of the footage five months after Prude's death had raised questions of a possible cover-up and turned Rochester into the latest flashpoint in a summer of protests over racial injustice first sparked by George Floyd's May 25 death.
Seven police officers involved in the arrest were suspended last week. The medical examiner ruled Prude's death a homicide by asphyxiation, with the drug PCP a contributing factor. He was having a psychotic episode when he was arrested. 
Black Lives Matter activists had called for Singletary's resignation. But as recently as Sunday, amid a weekend of demonstrations, he had said he intended to stay on, and Warren backed him. Both he and the mayor are Black.
""As a man of integrity, I will not sit idly by while outside entities attempt to destroy my character,"" Singletary said in a statement, noting his 20 years on the force.
""The mischaracterization and the politicization of the actions that I took after being informed of Mr. Prude’s death is not based on facts, and is not what I stand for.""
Warren, who has also come under pressure for the handling of Prude's arrest and death, said Singletary's deputy, Joseph Morabito, had also retired and that ""there may be a number of others that will decide to leave as well.""
The mayor said she was unsure when the retirements would take effect.
Free the People ROC, a local Black Lives Matter group, welcomed the resignations in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post but demanded more.
""Let's keep the pressure up until all those responsible for Daniel Prude's murder and cover up — including Mayor Lovely Warren - have resigned, taken responsibility and donated their pensions to the families they allowed to be harmed,"" it wrote.
Separately on Tuesday, Dallas police department chief Reneé Hall also agreed to resign after a backlash against her department's handling of demonstrations against racism and police brutality. Hall, who wrote her resignation letter on Tuesday, will stay on until the end of the year.
Last month, some Dallas City Council members said they had lost trust in Hall's leadership citing lack of transparency regarding the force that police used that injured some demonstrators.
Warren apologized to the Prude family last week and suggested she had been misled by Singletary - an allegation he denied. Singletary also pointed to his ordering of an internal investigation soon after the incident.

The Rochester police union's head, Michael Mazzeo, defended the officers last week, saying they followed procedure in using the so-called ""spit hood,"" necessary because Prude claimed he had the coronavirus. Mazzeo also said Singletary's office told him after the arrest there were ""no concerns"" with the officers' actions.

1013,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 12:50AM ET</span>",Surfer killed in shark attack on Australia's tourist Gold Coast,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A 46-year-old Australian surfer died after being attacked by a shark on a popular Gold Coast beach, the first fatal shark attack on the beach in 62 years and despite protective ""shark nets"" and drumlines offshore.
The man was attacked at Greenmount Beach late on Tuesday while surfing what is called the ""Superbank"", one of the world's best and most crowded waves and site for an annual world surfing championship contest.
Video of the attack from a beach surf camera showed dozens of other surfers in the water at the time. There can often be hundreds in the water as the break is regarded as one of the safest in Australia.
Other surfers took the man to shore, where he was treated for severe leg injuries, footage from local media showed. 
""Around 5 pm the man was pulled from the surf suffering from a life-threatening leg injury. The man succumbed to his injuries at the scene,"" Queensland state police said in a statement.
Beaches along the tourist strip Gold Coast have been closed.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Wednesday said a large tiger shark was trapped in safety nets off the beach, but it was unclear what type of shark was involved in the attack.
Specially designed ""shark nets"" are placed in the waters off many popular Australian beaches, which reduces the chance of a shark attack but they do not create a total barrier between swimmers and sharks. Some beaches also have drumlines, which bait sharks which are then released offshore. 
Australia's east coast has had a number of Great White Shark attacks in recent months. There have been a total of 19 shark attacks in 2020, according to data published by the Taronga Conservation Society.

1014,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",Brexit Endgame Spurs U.K. Investors to Buckle Up for a Wild Ride,"(Bloomberg) -- In a year that’s featured a global pandemic and a tidal wave of liquidity from central banks, investors are bracing themselves for a risk they’ve ignored for most of 2020: Brexit.
The prospect of the U.K. and European Union reaching a trade agreement by an October deadline is looking less likely, with Britain saying this week it’s willing to walk away. That risks the pound falling to a 35-year low, stocks that lag international peers, and bond yields turning negative for the first time amid bets on Bank of England interest-rate cuts, fund managers say.
“If we have a big selloff in risk assets, and a bad Brexit outcome, then there’s no reason the pound couldn’t fall back through the March lows,” said Mike Riddell, a portfolio manager at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. That would mean a 12% slump to around $1.14, the lowest since 1985.
Until recently, the risks associated with failed trade talks had been in the background, overshadowed by the economic fallout of the coronavirus. The pound, which has acted as a market barometer to Brexit since the 2016 referendum, had been rallying along with other currencies in Group-of-10 nations against the U.S. dollar.
Complacency around Brexit prompted Riddell to add to a short pound position in recent months and use sterling as a risk-off hedge, mainly against the U.S. dollar and the yen.
By contrast analysts in a Bloomberg survey expect only a mild drop to $1.30 by end-2020 and then gains next year. Economists from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) all still anticipate a deal on commerce will be in place for the end of December.
But with formal talks between the U.K. and EU resuming this week, those risks are back on investors’ radar. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson signaled he would let the talks collapse if a deal isn’t made before mid-October rather than compromise. Officials have also drafted a law that risks undermining the negotiations, a move that Northern Ireland Minister Brandon Lewis conceded would break international law.
The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is “worried and disappointed.”
The flare-up in trade tensions has sent the pound tumbling by around 2% this week, to near $1.30. It’s increased the cost of hedging swings in sterling over three months to the highest level since May, while Johnson’s comments spurred the biggest jump for six months in options betting on a fall in the currency by December.
Value Trap
Brexit continues to be a drag on the nation’s equities, with the FTSE 100 falling to a record low against the MSCI World Index. While a slide in the pound may provide a boost for exporters, investors are more underweight on the U.K. than on any other country examined in a Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fund survey for August.
“We see the U.K. as a value trap,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. “Valuations might be attractive but fundamentals are not.”
In addition to Brexit, the U.K. is suffering one of the biggest hits to growth in Europe from the pandemic, and must decide next month whether to keep supporting millions of furloughed workers or face a surge in unemployment.
That could mean more pain for U.K. Plc, which combined with concern over a painful transition from the EU, may further fuel demand for the safety of gilts. Benchmark yields have fallen near a record set during the pandemic shock in March, and the rate on two-year bonds dropped Tuesday to an all-time low of minus 0.156%.
John Roe, head of multi-asset funds at Legal & General Investment Management, expects government bonds to rally if fears that trade talks will collapse drive up the possibility of U.K. interest rates going negative.
Money markets have brought forward pricing on a BOE cut below zero to May, compared to September earlier this week. The potential for turmoil also raises the chances for more central bank bond buying.
“It’s worth remembering that the Bank of England’s forecasts are based on the U.K. reaching a full trade agreement with the EU,” said Daniela Russell, head of U.K. rates strategy for  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), who sees 10-year yields falling to zero by the end of the year.
There’s a 40% chance yields could go below that to turn negative in the next year, said Jan von Gerich, a chief strategist at Nordea Bank Abp (OTC:NRDBY).
Bare Bones
A ‘bare-bones’ free trade deal would be enough to avoid such a scenario and lead Aberdeen Standard Investments to be underweight gilts, said Aaron Rock, an investment director.
And  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). foreign-exchange strategist Adam Pickett said the market hasn’t priced in the likelihood of the U.K. and the EU moving toward a last-minute agreement, and is targeting a climb back to $1.35.
Brexit fatigue could be one reason why markets are so far mostly positioned for a deal. Either way, fund managers will be glad to see the back of an issue that has forced them to work nights after late votes that flipped markets, defeated two prime ministers and divided the country.“It has dragged on long enough,” said Rock at Aberdeen Standard. “It will be better for all concerned if we can move on.”

1015,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 12:10AM ET</span>",More than 1 billion people face displacement by 2050: report,"By Luke Baker
LONDON (Reuters) - Rapid population growth, lack of access to food and water and increased exposure to natural disasters mean more than 1 billion people face being displaced by 2050, according to a new analysis of global ecological threats.
Compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), a think-tank that produces annual terrorism and peace indexes, the Ecological Threat Register uses data from the United Nations and other sources to assess eight ecological threats and predict which countries and regions are most at risk.
With the world's population forecast to rise to nearly 10 billion by 2050, intensifying the scramble for resources and fuelling conflict, the research shows as many as 1.2 billion people living in vulnerable areas of sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East may be forced to migrate by 2050.
By comparison, ecological factors and conflict led to the displacement of some 30 million people in 2019, the report said.
""This will have huge social and political impacts, not just in the developing world, but also in the developed, as mass displacement will lead to larger refugee flows to the most developed countries,"" said Steve Killelea, IEP's founder.
The register groups the threats into two broad categories: food insecurity, water scarcity and population growth in one; and natural disasters including floods, droughts, cyclones, rising sea levels and rising temperatures in the other.
The result is an analysis assessing how many threats each of some 150 countries faces and their capacity to withstand them.
While some, such as India and China, are most threatened by water scarcity in the coming decades, others like Pakistan, Iran, Mozambique, Kenya and Madagascar face a toxic combination of threats, as well as a diminishing ability to deal with them.
""These countries are broadly stable now but have high exposure to ecological threats and low and deteriorating 'positive peace', which means they are at higher risk of future collapse,"" the 90-page analysis found.
Killelea said the world now has 60% less fresh water available than it did 50 years ago, while demand for food is forecast to rise by 50% in the next 30 years, driven in large part by the expansion of the middle class in Asia.
Those factors, combined with natural disasters that are only likely to increase in frequency because of climate change, mean even stable states are vulnerable by 2050.

The IEP said it hoped the register, which may become an annual analysis, would shape aid and development policies, with more emphasis and funding going towards climate-related impacts.

1016,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 11:18PM ET</span>","China Tensions Make Aussie Firms Wary, But Not Running for Door","(Bloomberg) -- The spat between Canberra and Beijing seems to be getting worse by the day: A TV anchor detained, journalists fleeing, key imports banned. But Australians doing business in China say the risks are manageable -- so far.
“You’d think Australian business would be running away from China,” said Helen Sawczak, who was national chief executive officer of the Australia China Business Council until recently. “But Australian companies are still very buoyant about China.”
Australia is the most-China reliant developed economy in the world, making it vulnerable to Beijing using trade as a diplomatic cudgel. As well as targeting commodities like beef, wine and barley, Beijing has warned its citizens to avoid holidaying or studying in Australia -- endangering a key tourism and education market.
The Australian business community is largely staying quiet as ties worsen between the two governments. Being too vocal either way carries costs: Railing about human rights in China will jeopardize the market, but also pushing Australian political leaders too hard might lead to a backlash in the current environment.
“If you’re a business already operating in China, you’ll most likely try to ride it out and stick around,” said Jeffrey Wilson, the research director at the Perth USAsia Centre who specializes in the regional economic integration of the Indo-Pacific and trade agreements. “But for companies yet to make that step, they may think it’s best to avoid launching in Asia through China and go through other nations in the region instead, such as Malaysia or Japan.”
Ties between the key trading partners hit a new low this week as China confirmed that an Australian television anchor was being held over suspected state security violations, while the last two correspondents working for the Australian media there fled the country. Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s government has advised its citizens not to travel to China, saying they may be at risk of arbitrary detention.
“The perception of risk and real risks around China have been growing,” said Philipp Ivanov, chief executive officer of the Asia Society in Australia. While companies were nervous, they do not appear to be concerned about the safety of their staff in the country, at least for now, he said.
China was keen to continue to promote itself as open for business, and would be wary of the reputational and real economic hit of firms pulling staff out of the country, especially now when its economy is recovering from the pandemic and it is under political pressure from major democracies worldwide, Ivanov said. Equally, it would want to keep Australian and global business executives onside, in the hope they may help to influence their governments to tone down their policy rhetoric on China.
Relations have spiraled downward over a string of moves by Morrison’s government that China has interpreted as Australia siding with the Trump administration in the widening trade and security dispute. Australia’s actions have included barring Huawei Technologies Co.’s 5G technology and calling for an international probe into the origins of the coronavirus.
The media has also been caught up in the downward spiral.
Cheng Lei -- an Australian citizen employed by China’s English-language state broadcaster CGTN before her detention last month -- was “suspected of carrying out criminal activities endangering China’s national security,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters Tuesday in Beijing. The allegations, which give authorities broad powers to hold suspects for months without charge or access to a lawyer, are among the most serious ever brought against a foreign journalist in China.
The revelations came shortly after the last two China correspondents for Australian media outlets left the country after questioning from the Ministry of State Security. China’s state media has since reported that intelligence officials raided the residences of Chinese journalists based in Australia in late June.
Mark Tanner, managing director of Shanghai-based consultant China Skinny which counts supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths among its Australian clients, said the rising tensions were concerning. But Australians remained undeterred as the huge potential offered by China’s massive market outweighed any downside.
“China Skinny is still fielding a good flow of inquiries about market entry and growth strategies from Australian firms, although decisions are being made slower than before,” he said. “China is the most vibrant market right now.”

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 10:45PM ET</span>",New Zealand's ruling party plans higher tax for top earners if re-elected,"By Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Jacinda Ardern's ruling Labour Party said it would raise taxes for top income earners if it is returned to power in the polls next month, as the government looks to pay off debt accumulated due to its COVID-19 pandemic response.
Ardern's Labour Party, comfortably ahead in the election contest according to opinion polls, said it plans a new higher tax rate of 39% for people earning over NZ$180,000 ($118,908), which would only affect 2% of New Zealanders. 
“Our plan strikes a balance as we recover from COVID-19,"" Finance Minister Grant Robertson said in Wellington. The new policy is forecast to generate annual revenue of NZ$550 million, he said.
But it still puts New Zealand at the bottom third of income tax rates within OECD countries, and Robertson said the tax is lower than neighbouring Australia which has a tax rate of 47% for income above A$180,000, including a 2% Medicare levy.
The highest tax rate in New Zealand is currently 33% for income over NZ$70,000. 
Ardern, who leads a centre-left coalition government, is riding a wave of popularity after successfully limiting the spread of COVID-19, and is predicted to win a second term in the Oct. 17 election.
But economic challenges loom as the virus restrictions brought the economy to a grinding halt.
""No country in the world has ever taxed itself out of recession, but Labour’s first instinct is to raise your taxes,"" said opposition National Party spokesman Paul Goldsmith.
The government earmarked NZ$62 billion for its COVID response plan, and has spent billions on wage subsidy schemes and other measures to protect jobs.
Ardern defended the new tax saying it was needed to ensure the government could continue funding health and education projects.

""This is the totality of our tax policy,"" Ardern said during a campaigning trip to Whakatane, adding the party will not make any further tax increases next term.

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will announce a further drawdown of U.S. troops from Iraq on Wednesday, a senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday. 
That announcement will be followed by another one in the coming days on a further reduction in U.S. forces in Afghanistan, the official said.
The decision comes as Trump, a Republican, faces blowback from a report that he allegedly made disparaging remarks about U.S. war dead.
Trump is trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden in polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election. His announcement, and the timing of it, may be aimed at convincing voters that he is following through on promises to end what he has described as America's endless wars.
The United States has around 5,200 troops that were deployed in Iraq to fight the Islamic State militant group. 
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last month that the United States was expected to reduce the number of its troops in Iraq by about a third in the coming months.

The United States currently has about 8,600 troops in Afghanistan. Trump said in an interview with Axios released last month that the United States planned to lower that number to about 4,000.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 09:25PM ET</span>",Japan's fractured opposition unites as Suga set to succeed PM Abe,"By Linda Sieg and Ami Miyazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Eight years after Japan's Democratic Party was ousted and began unravelling, opposition groups are once again unifying for a general election that could come soon, but they face an uphill battle to dent the current ruling bloc's performance.
The drive to unite has taken on new urgency as the dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) prepares to pick a new leader on Sept. 14 after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said last month he would resign because of an illness.
Japan's centre-left opposition, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), will merge with most of its former colleagues in the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) next week after picking a new leader on Thursday. 
The two groups, plus a batch of unaffiliated opposition MPs, emerged when the Democratic Party imploded in 2017 before a general election that the LDP won handily.
The newly merged party, to be formally launched on Sept. 15, could face an early test.
Abe's lieutenant, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, is expected to win the LDP race, virtually assuring he becomes premier because of the party's majority in parliament.
Suga and the LDP have already gotten a bump in voter surveys, and speculation is mounting that he will swiftly call a general election. 
A strong performance by the LDP would boost Suga's chances of winning a full three-year term after finishing Abe's tenure.
""Inside the LDP, everyone knows it (support rates) will never be this high again,"" said Steven Reed, a professor emeritus at Chuo University. Support for the LDP had risen to 41% from 33% in a recent Yomiuri newspaper survey, compared with 4% for the CDPJ.
Abe's nearly eight-year rule, which made him Japan's longest-serving prime minister, was aided by the fragmented opposition because of Japan's electoral system, in which most constituencies elect a single member of parliament to the lower house.
That means the ruling party benefits if several opposition candidates compete. In the last lower-house election, in 2017, the CDPJ won just 54 seats, a fraction of the two-thirds majority garnered by the LDP and its smaller coalition partner.
The new opposition party, which will most likely be led by CDPJ chief Yukio Edano, will have 149 incumbents out of a combined 710 lawmakers in parliament's two chambers, compared with the LDP's nearly 400.
""If a party has only 50-60 members, even if it speaks of taking power, it's a joke,"" Jun Azumi, who handles parliamentary affairs for the CDPJ, told Reuters in an interview. ""In that sense, to create a big group is extremely significant.""
The merged party will likely cooperate with the Japanese Communist Party in fielding candidates, a stance that helps its chances but may put off some of the DPP's more conservative members.
Azumi said the new party would call for reducing the 10% sales tax to boost the coronavirus-stricken economy and ending reliance on nuclear power, a stance sharply at odds with the LDP's position despite the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.
The centrist Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), founded in 1996, has long struggled with internal dissent.
""Opposition parties are not even close to being united,"" said Meiko Nakabayashi, a professor and former DPJ lawmaker. ""They say they will be, but it's really doubtful.""
The Democrats ousted the long-dominant LDP in 2009 but after a troubled three years, lost power.
Katsuya Okada, who led the DPJ from 2004-2005, said unifying members was a big challenge.

""What I struggled with most was to pull the party together,"" Okada said. ""While respecting diversity, each member must bear in mind the importance of coming together ... under a chosen leader.""

SHANGHAI/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian intelligence agency staff searched the homes of Chinese journalists in June, questioning them for several hours and removing their computers and mobile phones, China's state news agency Xinhua reported late on Tuesday.
The Xinhua report comes shortly after two Australian journalists returned home with the help of consular officials after the pair were visited at their homes in Beijing and Shanghai and later questioned by China's state security ministry.
The Xinhua report said the Australian searches, which it described as ""raids"", were carried out on an unspecified number of Chinese journalists homes by intelligence personnel on June 26. The journalists were told to ""be silent"" about the incident, Xinhua said, without citing sources. 
Asked if it could confirm the raids, the Chinese embassy in Canberra said in an emailed statement to Reuters it had ""provided consular support to Chinese journalists in Australia and made representations with relevant Australian authorities to safeguard legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens"".
The Xinhua report also criticised a search of the home and office of New South Wales state politician Shaoquett Moselmane on the same day, alleging he was targeted for his praise of China's achievements in fighting the epidemic and criticising Australia's China policy.
""In a country with so-called 'rule of law', there is no justification and no conclusive evidence to search homes and seize personal belongings, which is completely committing ""white terror"" against the personnel of Chinese institutions and friends of China,"" Xinhua said.
Australia has a tense diplomatic relationship with China, which worsened this year after Beijing vowed trade reprisals and said it was angered by Australia's call for an international inquiry into the source of the coronavirus pandemic.
Asked about the Xinhua report, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) said in an emailed statement that ""as is long-standing practice, ASIO does not comment on intelligence matters.""
The Australian Federal Police (AFP), which conducted a search of the offices of Moselmane and his employee, John Zhang, on June 26, said ""there is an ongoing investigation relating to the Moselmane search warrant"". Asked about the reported raids on journalists' homes, the AFP said it had no further comment, pointing out it is not an intelligence agency.
Zhang is under scrutiny as part of a foreign interference investigation by the AFP into whether he was working to advance “Chinese state interests”, according to documents lodged in Australia's High Court.
The reported June 26 searches of the Chinese journalists in Australia were also detailed in The Global Times, an English-language tabloid run by the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper, which attributed the information to a source. The Chinese embassy distributed the Global Times article to other journalists in Australia and said it was ""concerning"".
The two Australian journalists who arrived home from China on Tuesday had sought shelter in the embassy in Beijing and the consulate in Shanghai after police entered their homes a week ago and told them they were barred from leaving China.
Their departure leaves Australian media organisations with no correspondent in China for the first time since the 1970s.

KYIV (Reuters) - Belarusian authorities drove prominent opposition leader Maria Kolesnikova to the border with Ukraine on Tuesday, a day after she was snatched from the street in Minsk, but she tore up her passport so they could not force her to cross, two of her allies said.
The fate of Kolesnikova, a key figure during four weeks of mass protests against President Alexander Lukashenko, had been a mystery since supporters said masked men had whisked her away in a van on Monday. Belarusian police were quoted as saying they had not detained her.
Two fellow opposition figures, Anton Rodnenkov and Ivan Kravtsov, told a news conference in Kyiv that they had been detained by Belarusian officials in plain clothes, who escorted them to the border and then put Kolesnikova into their car and told them to cross.
""As soon as she ended up in the car and saw her passport, she immediately took her passport and tore it up into little pieces and crumpled the pieces and threw them out the window at the people standing around the car,"" Rodnenkov said. 
""After that, she opened the window and got out (through the window) and walked towards the Belarusian border."" There she was detained by the Belarusians again.
Kolesnikova's disappearance followed the arrest or flight of other opposition figures before and since last month's presidential election, which official results showed had been won by Lukashenko with 80% of the vote.
Deputy Ukrainian Interior Minister Anton Gerashchenko had earlier told Reuters Kolesnikova had successfully prevented ""a forcible expulsion from her native country"".
""Maria Kolesnikova made a courageous act that did not allow the Belarusian special services to expel her to the territory of Ukraine,"" he said. ""All responsibility for her life and health is on Alexander Lukashenko, the dictator of Belarus.""
LUKASHENKO
Lukashenko contradicted their account, saying her associates had thrown Kolesnikova out of the vehicle after being stopped by border guards and that she had then been detained.
Lukashenko also told Russian reporters he would not rule out holding new elections, but rejected any talks with opponents who he said were bent on steering the country towards disaster.
""Of course, for me, it's very frustrating and tragic, if you wish. But it does not mean I gave up,"" he said, adding that the majority of people had voted for him. ""Maybe they are a little bit tired of me. But they supported me.""
Police detained dozens of people from among hundreds who protested on Tuesday evening in Minsk against Kolesnikova's disappearance, some chanting ""Maria, you are a hero"".
Masked police dragged some of the protesters away from the crowd, including some women who they pulled by their hair, a witness said.
Fellow opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who is in exile in neighbouring Lithuania, called for Kolesnikova to be released, telling Reuters that her detention would only inflame the anti-government protests. 
Lukashenko, who has crushed dissent in Belarus for the past 26 years, conceded in his interview with Russian journalists that he may have held onto power too long.
""Yes, maybe I overstayed a bit,"" Russian journalist Roman Babayan cited Lukashenko as saying.
But the 66-year-old leader said he was the only person capable of protecting the country for now.
Belarus has seen a tense political stalemate since the disputed presidential election on Aug. 9, with protesters flooding the streets and security forces responding with mass arrests and - according to some of those detained - beatings and torture.
The country of 9.5 million people is of key strategic interest to Moscow as a route for its oil and gas exports and a buffer between NATO and Russia.

Lukashenko denies opponents' accusations of vote-rigging and has accused foreign powers of trying to topple him in a revolution. He retains the backing of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key ally, but faces the prospect of European Union sanctions later this month against Belarusian officials involved in the election and its violent aftermath.

LONDON (Reuters) - Tough new lockdown restrictions on social gatherings across the whole of England are to be announced on Wednesday as Prime Minister Boris Johnson tries to control a spike in COVID-19 infections.
From Sept. 14, groups of more than six people will be banned from meeting and fined if they fail to comply, Johnson will say.
The number of cases in Britain has begun to rise sharply again in recent days. Although testing is more widespread and the number of people in hospital is well below the peak of the outbreak, ministers fear it is beginning to slip out of control.
""We need to act now to stop the virus spreading,"" Johnson will say. ""So we are simplifying and strengthening the rules on social contact - making them easier to understand and for the police to enforce.""
The previous limit on the number of people who could socialise together was 30.
There were 2,460 new infections reported on Tuesday, 2,948 on Monday and 2,988 on Sunday - a sharp rise from levels of around 1,000 per day in August and attributed to high transmission among young people.
The new rules will not apply to workplaces or schools, and there will be exemptions for weddings, funerals and some organised team sports. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own lockdown policies.
Nevertheless, it represent a backwards step in Britain's recovery from a pandemic that inflicted more deaths and more economic damage on the country than it did on European peers and has prompted widespread criticism of Johnson's leadership.
The decision will harm attempts to convince a sceptical public that it is safe to return to their workplaces - something Johnson and his ministers spent much of last week trying to do in a bid to limit the economic damage to town and city centres.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia's northern Tigray region is holding elections on Wednesday in defiance of a federal edict that the polls are illegal, intensifying a confrontation between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and politicians who dominated the previous administration. 
""The vote will go ahead as planned, and we do not expect the federal government to interfere,"" Muluwork Kidanemariam, the head of the regional election commission, told Reuters by phone on Tuesday evening.
Ethiopia’s upper house, which mediates constitutional disputes, ruled on Saturday that the polls for regional parliaments and other positions were unconstitutional. Ethiopia had been due to hold national and regional elections in August but postponed them because of the coronavirus pandemic. [USKBN25W0SA]
Tigray's defiance of the federal government is the latest headache for Abiy, who is struggling to hold together a federation that stitches Ethiopia's 80 plus ethnic groups into Africa's second-largest nation. 
After decades of repression, he ushered in democratic reforms that helped win him the Nobel Prize. But the new freedoms also fuelled long-suppressed demands for more regional autonomy, rights and resources. 
In the past three years, Ethiopia has faced multiple bouts of outbreaks of large-scale ethnic violence, what the government described as an attempt at a regional coup led by rogue security forces, and increasingly insistent demands from smaller ethnic groups for their own regions. 
Tigray has dominated Ethiopian politics since guerilla fighters ousted a Marxist dictator in 1991. Its population is relatively small - around 5% of Ethiopia's 109 million people - but its history in politics means it is wealthier and more influential than many other, larger regions. 
On Monday Ethiopian security officials prevented a dozen people, including four journalists and a senior think tank analyst, from flying to Tigray to cover the vote. [USKBN25Y156]
Abiy has not specified how he will respond to the polls, although he has ruled out using force. Analysts say the government cut the region's federal funding, which supplies around half of its budget.

They said Queen Alia international airport would initially handle six flights a day before expanding to ensure that airport authorities can enforce strict social distancing and other health rules.
The government had repeatedly postponed reopening Jordan's main airport, a regional hub which normally handles around nine million passengers annually, over fears that travelers could bring about an increase in infections. 
The airport, however, was open for repatriation flights arranged for citizens in the Gulf and Europe and also for foreigners resident in Jordan who want to leave.
Passengers entering Jordan would need proof of a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of travel, alongside a compulsory test on arrival, officials said.
The rules would include a minimum of one week of self-isolation to a maximum two weeks of quarantine for foreign travelers depending on the severity of the pandemic in countries they came from.
Although Jordan has seen a spike in infections in the last few weeks, the country remains one of the least affected in the Middle East, with 2,581 infections and 17 deaths.
The closure of the airport since mid March has worsened the economic damage wrought by the pandemic on Jordan’s aid-dependent economy.

Tourism is a major source of foreign currency and had been enjoying an unprecedented boom before the pandemic.

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 04:15PM ET</span>",Trump's ex-lawyer Cohen links Falwell’s endorsement in 2016 to suppression of racy photos,"By Aram Roston
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In his book released today, Michael Cohen, the former fixer for U.S. President Donald Trump, ties for the first time the 2016 presidential endorsement of Trump by American evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr to Cohen’s own role in helping to keep racy “personal” photographs of the Falwells from becoming public. 
As Reuters reported last year, the Falwells enlisted Cohen to keep “a bunch of photographs, personal photographs” from becoming public, Cohen said in a recording, made surreptitiously by comedian Tom Arnold. “I actually have one of the photos,” he said, without going into specifics. “It’s terrible.”
In “Disloyal: The Memoir,” Cohen describes thinking that his involvement in the Falwell photo matter would be a “catch and kill” -- the practice of American tabloids to obtain and then suppress unfavorable stories about celebrities -- “but in this case it was just going to be kill.” 
He later writes: “In good time, I would call in this favor, not for me, but for the Boss, at a crucial moment on his journey to the presidency.”
Cohen has said that he helped persuade Falwell to endorse Trump just before Republican voters gathered in Iowa in February 2016 to nominate a presidential candidate. Falwell not only publicly vouched for Trump’s Christian virtues but also barnstormed with the candidate. His backing of Trump -- a twice-divorced candidate who had talked about grabbing women’s genitals and engaged in extramarital affairs -- was one of the major surprises of the 2016 campaign.
In the book, Cohen doesn’t explicitly say that the endorsement was the favor he sought in return for his help in having kept the Falwell photos from getting out. But his account marks the first time he has linked the two issues.
Earlier this year, Cohen was quoted by CNN saying “there is absolutely no connection between the photos and my personal request to the Falwells to assist the Trump campaign.” How that comment jibes with what he’s written in his book is unclear. Cohen did not immediately respond to efforts by Reuters to reach him.
After this story was published, Jerry Falwell spoke by phone with Reuters. He said that “someone stole some pictures I took of my wife in the back yard. Topless. Big deal. OK?” But he said his endorsement of Trump had nothing to do with Cohen’s role in suppressing the racy photographs.
“It was no quid pro quo,” Falwell said. “There was no me supporting Trump because of whatever Michael was doing.”
Falwell said he endorsed Trump, at Cohen’s behest, because Falwell “believed that a businessman needed to run this country.”
Toward the end of the call, Becki Falwell, who has not commented on the Cohen book or the photographs, could be heard urging her husband to cut short the conversation with Reuters. “Hang up the goddamn phone,” she told her husband. “Hang up the phone, Jerry!”
The White House dismissed Cohen’s account.
“Michael Cohen is a disgraced felon and disbarred lawyer, who lied to Congress. He has lost all credibility, and it’s unsurprising to see his latest attempt to profit off of lies,” press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told Reuters.
Cohen, who was convicted of campaign finance violations and other crimes, is serving the remainder of his three-year term in home confinement.
Falwell, who at the time of the 2016 endorsement ran Liberty University, stepped down as president of Liberty late last month after Reuters reported that a business associate alleged a years-long affair with Jerry and Becki Falwell. 
That associate, Giancarlo Granda, told Reuters the relationship involved him having sex with Becki Falwell while Jerry Falwell watched. Jerry Falwell has denied involvement, saying the sexual relationship was between his wife and Granda only.
Falwell’s departure from Liberty marked a dramatic fall for one of the most powerful figures in America’s evangelical Christian movement. He was widely credited with helping persuade many Christians concerned about Trump’s past to accept him as a repentant sinner.
In his book, Cohen writes that he had become close to the Falwells in 2011, once securing tickets for one of their daughters to see Justin Bieber perform. He calls the Falwells “dear friends, more like family to me.” 
But he also makes clear that, as in the smaller assistance in securing the Bieber tickets, he saw the help he offered the Falwells in the photo matter as transactional -- and enormously significant. 
“Like the Bieber favor a few years earlier, this would have a huge impact on the 2016 election, evangelicals, the Supreme Court and the fate of the nation,” Cohen writes. 
“If Becki Falwell was seen half-naked by the students of Liberty University, let alone evangelicals all over the country, it would be an unmitigated disaster,” he writes.
After succeeding at keeping the photos from being released, Cohen writes that he “called Becki and reassured her that the pictures wouldn’t get out, but I could hear the fear and sadness in her voice. I reassured her I wouldn’t let her down, and I didn’t.”

“There it was: my second chit with the Falwells,” he writes. “In good time, I would call in this favor, not for me, but for the Boss, at a crucial moment on his journey to the presidency.”

""We, the G7 foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in condemning, in the strongest possible terms, the confirmed poisoning of Alexei Navalny,"" said the statement.
Navalny, who is being treated in a Berlin hospital, was airlifted to Germany after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight last month. Germany says he was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent in an attempt to murder him; Russia has said it has seen no evidence that Navalny was poisoned.
Germany briefed the G7, which the United States is chairing this year, on its determination that Navalny ""is the victim of an attack with a chemical nerve-agent of the 'Novichok' group, a substance developed by Russia,"" the G7 statement said.
""Any use of chemical weapons, anywhere, anytime, by anybody, under any circumstances whatsoever, is unacceptable and contravenes the international norms prohibiting the use of such weapons,"" the statement added, calling on Russia establish who was responsible ""for this abhorrent poisoning attack.""

""We will continue to monitor closely how Russia responds to international calls for an explanation of the hideous poisoning of Mr. Navalny,"" it said.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 03:55PM ET</span>","After Trump comments, top Army general defends military's leaders","By Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A day after President Donald Trump accused the U.S. military brass of wanting to fight wars to keep weapons makers happy, the Army's top general said on Tuesday leaders of the armed forces would recommend sending troops into combat only when it is in American national security interests or as a last resort.
Asked about Trump's Monday criticism of Pentagon leaders, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General James McConville declined to comment directly on it, saying the military should remain out of politics, especially close to an election. 
""Many of these leaders have sons and daughters that serve in the military, many of these leaders have sons and daughters who have gone to combat or may be in combat right now,"" McConville, who Trump appointed to his post, said during an online forum hosted by Defense One, a media organization focusing on the U.S. military.
""I can assure the American people that the senior leaders would only recommend sending our troops to combat when it is required in national security and in the last resort. We take this very, very seriously in how we make our recommendations,"" McConville added.
Trump has increasingly clashed with Pentagon leaders over a range of issues after initially giving retired generals senior positions in his administration. 
Trump is seeking re-election on Nov. 3, facing Democratic candidate Joe Biden.
At a White House news conference on Monday, Trump criticized Biden, describing him as a proponent of ""endless wars,"" before turning his criticism toward military leaders who he himself appointed, saying they are interested in conflict to satisfy military contractors.
""I'm not saying the military is in love with me. The soldiers are. The top people in the Pentagon probably aren't because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs, make the planes, make everything else stay happy,"" Trump said.
""But we're getting out of endless wars,"" Trump added. ""Some people don't like to come home. Some people like to continue to spend money. One cold-hearted globalist betrayal after another, that's what it was.""
Such criticism of military leaders by a sitting president is highly unusual.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on Tuesday said Trump's comments were not directed at Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Army General Mark Milley, who serves as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or other military leaders. 
""That comment was more directed about the military industrial complex,"" Meadows said on Fox News, using a term that refers to the U.S. military establishment and defense industry.
Meadows did not mention any names or explain specifically who Trump meant when the president referred to ""top people in the Pentagon."" Trump appointed both Esper and Milley to their current posts.
Trump's comments followed media reports last week that he had called fallen U.S. troops buried in Europe ""losers"" and declined to visit an American cemetery in France in 2018 because he thought it unimportant. Trump has denied the reports. 
Areas of disagreement between the Republican president and Pentagon leaders have included Trump's threats to deploy active-duty troops in response to a wave of protests against racism and police brutality - a step Esper and Milley both opposed.
Milley, the top U.S. military officer, in June also said he made a ""mistake"" when he joined Trump as the president walked from the White House to a nearby church and held up a copy of the Bible for a photo opportunity after authorities cleared away protesters using chemical irritants and rubber bullets.

Trump has faced sharp criticism in recent months from senior retired military leaders including retired General James Mattis, the U.S. defense secretary during Trump's first two years in office who accused his former boss of trying to divide Americans.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States expanded its sanctions on Lebanon on Tuesday, blacklisting two former government ministers it accused of providing material and financial help to Hezbollah and warning that more actions targeting the Iran-backed Shi'ite group were coming.
U.S. officials also said Washington was coordinating with France on Lebanon but voiced criticism over a meeting French President Emmanuel Macron held with Lebanese politicians, including a member of Hezbollah, seen as a terrorist organization by the United States.
In a statement, the U.S. Treasury Department said it had designated former Lebanese Transport Minister Yusuf Finyanus and former Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil for engaging in corruption and leveraging their political power for financial gain.
""Finyanus and Khalil were involved in directing political and economic favors to Hezbollah and involved in some of the corruption that made Hezbollah's work possible in Lebanon,"" David Schenker, assistant secretary for Near East Affairs at the U.S. State Department told a briefing call.
""This should be a message to both to those who cooperate with Hezbollah, those who enable Hezbollah but also to Lebanon's political leaders,"" Schenker said. ""Everyone should absolutely expect more designations to come,"" he added.
Media reports suggested that Washington had been initially looking to designate Gebran Bassil, the influential son-in-law of Lebanese President Michel Aoun and a former foreign minister who heads the largest Christian political bloc in the sectarian power-sharing system.
Asked by reporters if Bassil and Riad Salama, a Lebanese central bank governor, were next to be sanctioned by the United States, senior U.S. government officials on a separate briefing call declined to comment.
Fifteen years after the assassination of Lebanon's Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, heavily armed group Hezbollah has risen to become the overarching power in a country that is now collapsing under a series of devastating crises.
Lebanon's banks are paralyzed, its currency has crashed and sectarian tensions are rising. On top of that, a huge port blast last month smashed a large swath of Beirut, killing more than 190 people and causing damage estimated at up to $4.6 billion.
Macron, whose pressure prompted Lebanon's bickering leaders to agree on a new prime minister, has spearheaded international efforts to set Lebanon on a new course after decades of corrupt rule led to its deepest crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.

While France, Lebanon's former colonial power, is at the forefront of diplomacy, Iran through its support for Hezbollah also has influence. The United States is also a major donor to Lebanon, including to the Lebanese army.

Sweden avoided a lockdown and instead emphasized personal responsibility, social distancing and good hygiene in a bid to slow rather than eradicate a disease deemed here to stay.
The strategy drew fierce criticism home and abroad as deaths shot up during the spring but has also been lauded by WHO officials as a sustainable model.
""The purpose of our approach is for people themselves to understand the need to follow the recommendations and guidelines that exist,"" Swedish Health Agency Director-General Johan Carlson told a news conference. 
Whereas many countries have changing rules and lockdown restrictions, Carlson said the Swedish guidelines were designed to be easy to understand and retain for an extended period.
""There are no other tricks before there are available medical measures, primarily vaccines. The Swedish population has taken this to heart,"" he said.
More than 5,800 people with the disease have died, many times higher per capita than in neighbouring Nordic countries but lower than Italy, Spain and the UK.
Deaths, hospitalisations and new cases have now dropped to low levels whilst countries such as Spain and France contend with surges in infections after they lifted lockdowns.
Sweden carried out over 120,000 tests last week with just over 1,300 coming back positive, far below the 19% positive tests hit during some weeks in the spring, and now has the lowest rate of spread in Scandinavia.
""Our strategy has been consistent and sustainable. We probably have a lower risk of spread here compared to other countries,"" said Jonas Ludvigsson, professor of epidemiology at Karolinska Institutet, adding that Sweden likely had a higher level of immunity in the population than most countries. 
""I think we benefit a lot from that now,"" he said.
The approach has its critics. An editorial in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper said the growing numbers lauding the Swedish strategy had forgotten the many dead.

Responding to a question from newspaper La Jornada, Lopez Obrador, a leftist, did not explain what could prompt such an extradition request for Calderon, a conservative rival whom he accused of robbing him of the presidency in 2006.
Calderon governed Mexico from 2006 to 2012 and is arguably best known for launching a military-led crackdown on drug cartels that coincided with a spike in homicides and gang violence.
Lopez Obrador has lambasted Calderon since the latter's security minister, Genaro Garcia Luna, was arrested in Texas last year on suspicion of accepting millions of dollars in bribes from a major drug cartel he was tasked with combating.
Garcia Luna has denied taking money from the Sinaloa Cartel, the gang once led by convicted kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, but Lopez Obrador has held up the case as an egregious example of deep-seated corruption in past governments.
After making reference to Garcia Luna, La Jornada asked Lopez Obrador whether he would accept a U.S. extradition request for Calderon.
""Yes, as we do in all cases. We comply with all the agreements we have with the United States and we're asking them to also send those sought for trial in Mexico,"" he said.
Calderon, who is trying to establish a new party to take on Lopez Obrador, has not publicly commented on the interview. He has previously dismissed allegations of corruption and has not been charged with any wrongdoing.
Lopez Obrador also told La Jornada that U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called Mexican migrants rapists and says Mexico will pay for his planned border wall, had toned down his anti-Mexico rhetoric during his reelection campaign.

""It's no longer one of the main themes of his campaign agenda,"" he said. ""I applaud and appreciate that.""

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called on Tuesday for the release of Maria Kolesnikova, the highest-profile opposition figure still at large until this week, when supporters say she was snatched into a van.
Tsikhanouskaya, the main candidate standing against President Alexander Lukashenko in the Aug. 9 election, fled to neighbouring Lithuania after the vote which her followers say she won.
With most opposition figures jailed or in exile, a movement that has drawn tens of thousands of people onto the streets for demonstrations was led in part by musician-turned-politician Kolesnikova, who vanished on Monday, the morning after one of the biggest rallies yet.
""I hope that she will be released soon, because it would be one more mistake from our authorities if they put her in jail without any reason"", Tsikhanouskaya told Reuters at her headquarters in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. ""It would make our people even angrier.""
Neighbouring Ukraine has said Belarusian authorities attempted to forcibly expel Kolesnikova. Interfax news agency said she prevented her expulsion by tearing up her passport at the frontier. Belarusian border guards have said she is in detention but have not said where. 
Tsikhanouskaya said she was proud that Kolesnikova had managed to prevent her forcible expulsion.
Tsikhanouskaya, a 37-year-old English teacher and political novice, emerged as the consensus opposition candidate after better known figures, including her own jailed activist husband, were barred from standing. She has called for new elections and said she would not stand.
Tsikhanouskaya said Kolesnikova had told her she expected to be arrested at some point, and had a bag packed with warm clothes and spare underwear to take to jail.
Still, Tsikhanouskaya said she was shocked by what she called a kidnapping in the street, and urged the international community to apply pressure on Lukashenko to begin negotiations with the opposition.
""The first steps should be sanctions on certain persons, just to show the intention of the international society to help the Belarusian people. Maybe in the future we will need some more help, if the authorities don't go for dialogue"", she said.
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have imposed sanctions on 30 people including Lukashenko. The European Union is drawing up a list of individuals for its own sanctions, but has so far been cautious out of concern that strong action could drive Russia to intervene on behalf of Lukashenko.
Lithuania expressed concern on Monday that Lukashenko might relinquish his country's independence by signing an agreement on deeper integration with Russia.
Tsikhanouskaya suggested any such treaty would be illegitimate.
""It's a country for Belarusians and we want to keep our independence"", she said. ""So I ask all the leaders .... to remember that only Belarus's people can decide how to live in our country.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan's ruling party formally kicked off its leadership race on Tuesday, frontrunner and chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said that preventing the spread of the coronavirus should take priority in any decision to call a snap election.
Suga, a favourite to succeed incumbent Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is stepping down due to poor health, also stressed that the biggest job for the new prime minister will be to revive the coronavirus-ravaged economy.
""What all of our people are expecting is to see the coronavirus infection contained as soon as possible so they can feel safe and their daily lives return to normal,"" Suga told a TV Asahi programme on Tuesday.
""I have been saying all along that given the current circumstances, I don't think we can talk about dissolving parliament,"" he added.
Suga is widely expected to win the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) leadership election on Sept. 14, a date set after Abe's decision to step down. The winner is virtually assured of becoming premier because of the LDP's parliamentary majority.
Markets have been rife with speculation that if elected, Suga might dissolve parliament and call a snap election to solidify his political grip.
He signalled in an Asahi Shimbun interview that there was a chance of calling a snap elections but cautioned that the coronavirus would impact any such decision.
That speculation got a boost after opinion polls showed a jump in voter approval of Suga and of Abe's achievements.
The LDP leadership race among Suga and two rivals - former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba and ex-foreign minister Fumio Kishida - kicked off formally on Tuesday.
But Suga, chief cabinet secretary since December 2012, has already locked in support from most of the party's factions.
In his first campaign speech, Suga, 71, said he would pursue his boss's signature ""Abenomics"" policies of ultra-easy monetary policy and government spending, while grappling with the twin challenges of a coronavirus outbreak and reviving the economy.
""The key in this ruling party election is how to revive an economy that suffered its biggest postwar slump,"" he told a news conference. ""That's the responsibility for someone who will lead the country.""
Suga later told a separate programme broadcast by TBS that if he were to become prime minister, his key goal will also be to break down bureaucratic barriers so government agencies work together towards a common mission.
""We must do away with vested interests and promote deregulation,"" he said.
Suga spoke after data earlier on Tuesday showed Japan's economy sank deeper into its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter, underscoring the challenges the new prime minister face in easing the blow from COVID-19.
Suga, who has little diplomatic experience, will also confront a range of geopolitical challenges, including building ties with the winner of the U.S. presidential election and dealing with China over its maritime assertiveness.
In remarks light on security and foreign affairs, Suga said Japan's security environment was tough and said he wanted to build ""stable ties"" with Japan's neighbours, including China.

He gave little space to the issue of revising Japan's post-war, pacifist constitution - one of Abe's cherished goals - saying only he wanted to pursue ""constructive debate"" that went beyond the ruling-opposition parties' divide.

LONDON (Reuters) - Julian Assange, the Wikileaks founder who is fighting to avoid extradition to the United States from Britain, was warned by a judge on Tuesday he will be removed from the courtroom and tried in his absence if he continues to interrupt proceedings.
The proceedings were briefly adjourned after Assange shouted ""nonsense"" as James Lewis, acting for the U.S. government, told a witness that Assange was facing extradition proceedings over the publication of informants' names and not for handling leaked documents.Judge Vanessa Baraitser told Assange, who was in the dock, that he must not speak out even though he will hear things he disagrees with.
""If you interrupt proceedings and disrupt a witness who is properly giving their evidence, it is open to me to continue without you in your absence,"" Baraitser said.
""This is obviously not something I wish to do. I am, therefore, giving you a clear warning.""
The U.S. authorities accuse Australian-born Assange, 49, of conspiring to hack government computers and of violating an espionage law in connection with the release of confidential cables by WikiLeaks in 2010-2011.
Assange's outburst occurred as the court heard on Tuesday from Clive Stafford Smith, founder of the London-based charity Reprieve, who argues that the Wikileaks disclosures had been instrumental in challenging the U.S. on illegal drone strikes and the secret detention of suspects.
Stafford Smith, a dual US-UK national, said the leaked information had contributed to court findings that criminal proceedings should be taken against senior U.S. officials.
""I say this more in sadness than anger. I would never have believed that my government would do what it did,"" he said. ""We are talking about criminal offences of torture, kidnapping, rendition, holding people without trial."" 

Assange and WikiLeaks enraged the U.S. government a decade ago by publishing thousands of secret American documents. Assange's supporters see him as a champion of free speech exposing abuses of power and hypocrisy by Washington.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Sergio Barrera Ruiz, a 52-year-old pediatrician from Jujuy in the north of Argentina, sees a local health crisis looming as the coronavirus pandemic ripples out from Buenos Aires, the capital, and grips the country's less well-equipped outlying provinces.
Jujuy, a region of some 770,000 people, like other parts of the country has seen cases spike in recent weeks as nationwide deaths have topped 10,000 and cases speed toward 500,000, with almost one-in-two tests coming back positive. 
""Jujuy is in a health catastrophe, there aren't enough intensive therapy beds, doctors are getting sick and patients are dying,"" said Barrera Ruiz, who himself was infected with COVID-19 at work, where he said there are not enough medical personnel and an endless line of patients.
Argentina initially had controlled the spread of the virus with a tough quarantine since the middle of March, but as economic pressures grew, restrictions were eased and infections soared, taking the country into the global top 10 for cases.
Health Ministry data show that over the last month the number of confirmed infections daily is almost half that of the number of tests carried out, one of the highest ""positive"" rates in the world along with Mexico and Bolivia.
For months, over 90% of cases were concentrated in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area - home to almost a third of Argentina's population - while the provinces were mainly spared. That changed abruptly in recent weeks: The provinces now account for almost a third of cases, with Córdoba, Santa Fe, Jujuy and Mendoza the most affected areas after Buenos Aires and its suburbs.
(Graphic: Argentina COVID-19 infections - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/ARGENTINA/jbyprqkdove/chart.png)
TERRIBLE INCREASE
Experts link the increase in cases to the easing of a nationwide lockdown amid rising economic and political pressure on center-left President Alberto Fernandez. Argentina's quarantine has been in place for almost 170 days in various forms.
Around a dozen provinces have had to re-tighten restrictions in recent days due to the increase in infections. In some districts, health systems have collapsed, with neither the resources nor the personnel to support them.
""Two weeks ago we were practically without cases but when the quarantine was relaxed, the cases increased terribly. We are already at a limit of beds and resources,"" said Raúl Caraballo, a doctor in Santa Fe.
The current rolling seven-day average number of cases in Argentina is around 10,000 daily with around 200 daily deaths.
""People relaxed a lot and contagions increased in Chaco,"" said Adriana Perroni, an intensive care specialist in that northeastern province. ""Here we are seeing a lot of deaths of younger people, especially in the healthcare field.""
Rosa Reina, president of the Argentine Society of Intensive Care, told Reuters that the rise in cases had been very abrupt, with provinces going from few cases to having intensive care beds at over 80% capacity and an oversaturated workforce.
""If we do not prevent more hospitals admissions, it is very possible that we will very quickly become overwhelmed.""

The Riverside County Sheriff's Department responded to a report of an assault with a deadly weapon on Monday at 12:33 a.m. Deputies found a woman suffering from gunshot wounds at a home in the unincorporated area of Aguanga, 100 miles (161 km)southeast of Los Angeles. Paramedics rushed her to the hospital, the sheriff's department said in a statement. 
Six others with gunshot wounds were also found at the residence in the 45000 block of Highway 371, the statement said.
""All six victims at the location died as a result of their injuries. Despite life-saving efforts by medical personnel, the female who was transported also died from her injuries,"" the statement said. ""In total, seven victims died as a result of this incident.""
More than 1,000 pounds (453.6 kg) of marijuana and several hundred marijuana plants were found at the scene, the sheriff's department said.
""Evidence located at the scene indicated the location was being used to manufacture and harvest an illicit marijuana operation,"" the statement said.
While cannabis remains classified as an illegal narcotic under federal law, California in 2018 legalized its commercial distribution. As the most populous U.S. state, California opened the largest legalized, regulated and taxed marijuana market in the country.
A search of the area failed to immediately locate suspects. An investigation was underway and no further information was immediately available, sheriff's department Corporal Lionel Murphy told Reuters.
""This appears to be an isolated incident and there is no threat to the general public,"" the sheriff's department said.

A draft resolution presented by the Palestinian envoy, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, does not include a call to condemn, or act against, the Emirates over the U.S.-brokered deal.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also issued instructions on Tuesday banning any offensive statements or actions towards Arab leaders, including UAE rulers.
Announced on Aug. 13, the accord was the first such accommodation between an Arab country and Israel in more than 20 years, and was forged largely through shared fears of Iran.
The draft Palestinian resolution to be debated by Arab foreign ministers said the Israel-U.S.-Emirates announcement ""doesn’t diminish Arab consensus over the Palestinian cause, the Palestinian cause is the cause of the entire Arab nation”.
""The trilateral announcement doesn’t change the principal Arab vision based on the fact that the two-state solution on the 1967 borders is the only way to achieve peace in the Middle East,"" the draft said.
The tone is markedly different from that of Abbas, whose office on Aug. 13 called the accord ""betrayal"" and a ""stab in the back of the Palestinian cause."".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump have described the accord as historic, and urged other Arab countries to follow suit.
Emirati leaders said the deal shelved Israeli plans to annex territory in the occupied West Bank.

The ""military de-confliction"" talks, announced by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg last week, aim to prevent an escalation arising from incidents such as a collision last month between Greek and Turkish warships.
The warships had been shadowing a Turkish vessel surveying for oil and gas in disputed Mediterranean waters west of Cyprus, an operation that Greece condemned as illegal. Ankara and Athens each claim the area is part of their continental shelf.
Military delegations from the two NATO members had been due to hold talks at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday, following an initial contact last week, but the Turkish sources said the meeting had been delayed until Thursday.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu accused Greece of backtracking on an agreement to hold the technical talks - which will not address the underlying territorial dispute, but could discuss establishing a hotline between the two militaries and consistent use of naval call signs.
""If Greece believes in itself, if it has the courage and trusts its thesis, then ... let it come and sit at the table,"" Cavusoglu told a news conference in Ankara. 
Athens says that any discussion requires the departure of Turkish vessels from disputed waters, and a Greek source told Reuters their presence was causing tensions and a ""concentration of a great number of military forces in the area"". 
Greece seeks dialogue but not ""under threats, blackmail and provocations,"" Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou said.
Greece has also been pushing the European Union to sanction Turkey. European Council President Charles Michel said on Friday the bloc's leaders will decide on a ""carrot and stick"" approach to Turkey during a Sept. 24-25 meeting.
A NATO official said talks had begun to ""establish mechanisms for military de-confliction"", but declined to elaborate.

BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - Brazilian House Speaker Rodrigo Maia said on Tuesday that lawmakers are currently finalizing the text of a bill targeting those that finance ""fake news"" attacks on social media sites, adding it could be voted on by the end of this year.
The draft of the Brazilian bill was approved in the Senate on June 30, but the lower house created a working group to suggest modifications. Those changes will be finalized in two weeks, Maia said.
""(Social media) platforms will always say that they have no responsibility, but like any means of communication, they will have to create a path to responsibility too,"" Maia said during a webinar organized by the Getúlio Vargas Foundation.
In the run-up to Brazil's local elections this year, Maia, a member of a center-right party and opponent of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, said Brazil must punish individuals who use social media to try and silence and threaten others.

1053,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>","U.S. to block cotton, tomato product imports from China's Xinjiang over forced labor","By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday will move to block imports of cotton and tomato products from western China's Xinjiang region over allegations that they are produced with forced labor, officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection told Reuters.
The actions, which hit two of China's major commodity exports, are expected to be formally announced later on Tuesday by CBP Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan, along with five other import bans involving Xinjiang forced labor abuses in an unprecedented move likely to stoke tensions between the world's two largest economies.
The ""Withhold Release Orders"" allow the CBP to detain shipments based on suspicion of forced labor involvement under longstanding U.S. laws aimed at combating human trafficking, child labor and other human rights abuses.
The Trump administration is ratcheting up pressure on China over its treatment of Xinjiang's Uighur Muslims. The United Nations has said it has credible reports that 1 million Muslims have been detained in camps in the region, where they are put to work.
China denies mistreatment of the Uighurs and says the camps are vocational training centers needed to fight extremism.
CBP Executive Assistant Commissioner Brenda Smith told Reuters that the effective import bans will apply to the entire supply chains involving cotton, including cotton yarn, textiles and apparel, as well as tomatoes, tomato paste and other products exported from the region.
""We have reasonable but not conclusive evidence that there is a risk of forced labor in supply chains related to cotton textiles and tomatoes coming out of Xinjiang,"" Smith said. ""We will continue to work our investigations to fill in those gaps.""
U.S. law requires the agency to detain shipments when there is an allegation of forced labor, such as from non-governmental organizations, she said.
The bans could have far-reaching effects for U.S. retailers and apparel producers, as well as food manufacturers. China produces about 20% of the world's cotton and most of it comes from Xinjiang. China also is the world's largest importer of cotton, including from the United States.
""ABUSIVE WORKING AND LIVING CONDITIONS""
In March, the U.S. lawmakers proposed legislation that would effectively assume that all goods produced in Xinjiang are made with forced labor and would require certification that they are not.
In July, Washington issued an advisory saying companies doing business in Xinjiang or with entities using Xinjiang labor could be exposed to ""reputational, economic, and legal risks"".
The State Department also said it sent a letter to top American companies including Walmart Inc (N:WMT), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) warning them over risks faced from maintaining supply chains associated with human rights abuses in Xinjiang region.
In an announcement seen by Reuters, the CBP said it identified forced labor indicators involving the cotton, textile and tomato supply chains ""including debt bondage, unfree movement, isolation, intimidation and threats, withholding of wages, and abusive working and living conditions.""
The agency also is blocking cotton produced by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and apparel produced by Yili Zhuowan Garment Manufacturing Co Ltd. and Baoding LYSZD Trade and Business Co Ltd. It says these entities use prison labor from Chinese government administered ""re-education"" internment camps.
In addition, CBP is blocking imports of products made at the Lop County Industrial Park as well as the Lop County No. 4 Vocational Skills Education and Training Center. The moves follow the detention on July 1 of hair extensions and other goods from the Lop County Meixin Hair Product Co..
The CBP orders also block imports of computer parts made by the Hefei Bitland Information Technology Co Ltd, based in Anhui, China.

Although sea-borne migration to Spain is down nearly 19% this year, arrivals to the Canary Islands have surged 573% to 3,933 migrants, data from Spain's interior ministry shows.
A coast guard spokeswoman said 81 North African men were rescued from three small boats and taken to the port of Arguineguin on Gran Canaria, while another 29 reached the island on their own by boat. 
A Spanish Red Cross spokesman said another boat with around 10 migrants had also arrived.
At the crammed makeshift camp in Arguineguin, police with batons rushed to the area after a group of migrants moved a fence that encircles the camp, and made the protesters retreat without force. Some jumped the fence but were quickly told by police to go back into the camp. 
Migrant reception centres across the Canary islands are stretched to capacity and around 420 people are being held at the camp, the Red Cross said. Some of them have been there for several days enduring hot temperatures, sleeping on blankets on the concrete floor, amid increasing despair.
Analysts have suggested that beefed-up security in the Mediterranean is pushing more people to risk the perilous crossing to the Canaries, located around 60 miles west of Morocco.
Following local politicians' request for more help, the Spanish government said it plans to open more migrant centres on the island as the camp is meant to house migrants only for the first days, an immigration department spokeswoman said. 
An interior ministry source said the government had not been transferring migrants from the archipelago to mainland Spain for several years, and their deportation processes were mostly handled locally.

Laila Anita Bertheussen, 55, was arrested in March 2019, triggering the resignation shortly afterwards of then-Justice Minister Tor Mikkel Wara of Norway's anti-immigrant Progress Party.
Prosecutors believe Bertheussen set fire to her family's car, wrote threatening graffiti on their house and committed other acts of vandalism, with the purpose of generating public sympathy for herself and her partner.
In the months preceding the arrest, Bertheussen had said a play showing in Oslo, which was critical of Wara, posed a threat by showing images of the familiy's house, triggering a brief police investigation at the time of the theatre group itself.
When their home was later vandalized, Bertheussen said this vindicated her view, although she was eventually accused in all the cases herself.
""It will be argued that it was the theatre play that drove the accused to commit these acts,"" prosecutor Marit Formo told the court on the first day.
Threats were also sent to another government minister, leading to additional charges.
Standing upright throughout Tuesday's court procedings, Bertheussen declared herself not guilty on each of the 15 counts she faces. If found guilty, she could face up to 16 years in prison.
The court case is scheduled to run until Nov. 13.

LONDON (Reuters) - British ministers and medics are urging the public to get serious again about the coronavirus after fears the outbreak was slipping out of control in some areas.
Close to 3,000 new cases were recorded on Sunday and again on Monday - a sudden jump from numbers much closer to 1,000 for most of August, and the highest since May.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said young people who were too complacent about social distancing could endanger older relatives.
""Don't kill your gran by catching coronavirus and then passing it on,"" he told a BBC radio programme aimed at younger audiences on Monday.
Appearing before a parliamentary committee on Tuesday, he was concerned about the rise in cases. ""It is so important ... people don't become relaxed about this virus,"" he said.
Several media reported that the government was planning to cut the maximum number of people allowed to gather in a house in England. As things stand, groups of up to 30 people from two households are allowed to socialise indoors.
Some 41,554 people have died within 28 days of testing positive for COVID-19 in Britain, the worst fatalities toll in Europe, though in recent weeks infection numbers had been lower than in several European neighbours.
England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam warned of a ""creeping geographic trend"" as higher infection rates were being seen in many parts. ""That is really a signal that we've got to change this now, got to start taking it seriously, very seriously again,"" he told Channel 4 News.
The director of testing at the national test-and-trace scheme, Sarah-Jane Marsh, apologised to anyone who was unable to get a COVID-19 test at present, after reports that people in some areas were unable to access a testing facility.
""All of our testing sites have capacity, which is why they don't look overcrowded, it's our laboratory processing that is the critical pinch-point. We are doing all we can to expand quickly,"" Marsh said in a Tweet.

The two men admitted to killing dozens of villagers in northern Rakhine state and burying them in mass graves, according to the New York Times, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the non-profit Fortify Rights, citing statements the men made on videos filmed in Myanmar this year.
Reuters has not seen the videos cited by the news organisations. The New York Times said it could not independently confirm that the two soldiers committed the crimes to which they confessed.
Myanmar government and military spokesmen did not answer calls seeking comment.
The reports said the men had been in the custody of the Arakan Army insurgent group, which is now battling Myanmar government troops in Rakhine state, when they made the admissions and were later taken to The Hague in the Netherlands, where they could appear as witnesses or face trial.
It was not clear from the reports how the men fell into the hands of the Arakan Army, why they were speaking, or how they were transported to The Hague and under whose authority.
A spokesman for the International Criminal Court (ICC), based in The Hague, said it did not have the men in custody.
""No. These reports are not correct. We don't have these persons in the ICC custody,"" said the spokesman, Fadi el Abdallah.
Payam Akhavan, a Canadian lawyer representing Bangladesh in a filing against Myanmar at the ICC, said the two men had appeared at a border post requesting the protection of the government and had confessed to the mass murder and rape of Rohingya civilians in 2017.
""All I can say is that those two individuals are no longer in Bangladesh,"" he said.
A spokesman for the Arakan Army, Khine Thu Kha, said the two men were deserters and were not held as prisoners of war. He did not comment further on where the men were now, but said the group was ""committed to justice"" for all victims of the Myanmar military.
Myanmar has repeatedly denied allegations of genocide, saying its military operations in 2017 were targeting Rohingya militants who attacked police border posts. 
The ICC is investigating the crime against humanity of forced deportation of Rohingya to Bangladesh, as well as persecution and other inhumane acts.
A statement from the ICC Prosecutor's Office said: ""The office does not publicly comment on speculation or reports regarding its ongoing investigations, neither does the office discuss specifics of any aspect of its investigative activities.""

Myanmar is also facing charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice, also in The Hague, though that body does not bring cases against individuals or hear witnesses.

Iran said at the time that the fire was the result of sabotage and had caused significant damage that could slow the development of advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges.
""Due to the sabotage, it was decided to build a more modern, larger and more comprehensive hall in all dimensions in the heart of the mountain near Natanz. Of course, the work has begun,"" said Ali Akbar Salehi, according to state TV.
Natanz is the centrepiece of Iran's enrichment programme, which Tehran says is for peaceful purposes. Western intelligence agencies and the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog (IAEA) believe Iran had a coordinated, clandestine nuclear arms programme that it halted in 2003. Tehran denies ever seeking nuclear weapons.
The Natanz uranium-enrichment site, much of which is underground, is one of several Iranian facilities monitored by inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. nuclear watchdog.
A confrontation between arch foes Tehran and Washington has worsened since 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy.

Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear programme in exchange for the removal of most international sanctions. In reaction to U.S. sanctions, Tehran has gradually distanced itself from the nuclear pact.

KABUL/PESHAWAR (Reuters) - U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has held a meeting in Doha with the head of the new Taliban team due to open peace talks with a team representing the Afghan government, the Islamist insurgent group said on Tuesday.
The negotiations, the result of an agreement between Washington and the Taliban, are to begin in Doha after the release of the last half-dozen or so of 5,000 Taliban prisoners.
The Afghan negotiators had been expected to fly from Kabul to Doha this week, but are awaiting a signal from the Afghan government that the release - to which Western governments have objected - is going ahead.
In Doha, the head of the Taliban's political office, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, and the new head of the Taliban's negotiating team, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, met with Khalilzad and Qatar's deputy prime minister on Monday, Taliban spokesman Dr Mohammad Naeem said in a statement shared on Twitter.
""Issues related to the prisoners' release and immediate start of the intra-Afghan talks were discussed,"" Naeem said.
Talks with American officials had for the last two years been led by Baradar, who signed a peace deal with Washington this year that paved the way for an international troop withdrawal and intra-Afghan negotiations. 
Last week, however, Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhunzada announced that a new, 21-member team would be headed by Haqqani and not Baradar, a co-founder of the Taliban, who has been left out entirely.
Three Taliban commanders based in Afghanistan told Reuters that senior fighters on the ground had in recent weeks expressed reservations about Baradar's dominance in the talks.
However, Taliban officials told Reuters the team had been changed to give it power to take decisions on the spot.
Haqqani, the Taliban's former shadow chief justice, also heads its powerful council of religious scholars, according to two senior Taliban officials who did not want to named.
One official said Akhunzada trusted Haqqani more than anyone else in the group: ""(His) presence basically means our supreme leader himself will attend the peace talks.""

A diplomat following the peace process from Kabul told Reuters, on condition of anonymity: ""Baradar might be effective, but Haqqani is senior. What we know is this was done to have a more authoritative team that can take the decision over there.""

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Tuesday sentenced a Christian man to death on blasphemy charges.
Asif Pervaiz, a garment factory worker, had been accused by his supervisor of sending derogatory remarks about the Muslim Prophet Muhammad to him in a text message.
Insulting the prophet carries a mandatory death penalty in Pakistan, a predominantly Muslim country.
Pervais was convicted after a trial in Lahore that ran since 2013. His lawyer Saif-ul-Malook told Reuters he would appeal the sentence.
The court order, seen by Reuters, said Pervaiz would first serve a three-year prison term for ""misusing"" his phone to send the derogatory text message. Then ""he shall be hanged by his neck till his death."" 
He was also fined 50,000 Pakistani rupees ($300), the order said. 
Pervaiz told the court his supervisor made the accusation only after he had refused to convert to Islam, Saif-ul-Malook said. The complainant's lawyer, Murtaza Chaudhry, denied this was the case.
Human rights groups say blasphemy laws are often misused to persecute minorities or even against Muslims to settle personal rivalries. Islamist extremism has been on the rise in Pakistan and such accusations can end up in lynchings or street vigilantism.
A U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin on a blasphemy trial in the northwestern city of Peshawar in July was shot dead in the courtroom by a teenager who told bystanders he killed him for insulting the Prophet Muhammad. [nL4N2F92HQ]

Two people were treated by medics and at least one was taken to hospital, said Sergei Boyko, an opposition politician and ally of Navalny, who is being treated in hospital in Germany after what Berlin said was an attempt to kill him by poisoning.
Boyko, who is running for the city council of Novosibirsk in Siberia in an election on Sunday, said it was unclear what substance had been thrown in the campaign office but that police had said it was not toxic. 
Boyko's election campaign group described it as a chemical that was caustic and foul-smelling. 
CCTV footage shared by Navalny's allies showed two hooded men sprinting away after the incident. The activists had gathered to listen to a talk on how to monitor elections, Boyko said. 
Boyko is one of a number of supporters of Navalny running in local elections across Russia at the weekend. 
Navalny was admitted to hospital last month after collapsing on a plane to Moscow from Siberia, where he had met with allies running in the elections. 

He was airlifted to Germany for treatment and Berlin has since said he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. Russia has said it has seen no evidence that he was poisoned.

MOSUL, Iraq, (Reuters) - When the Iraqi city of Mosul went into lockdown in March, Mohammed Sattar, who lost both his legs when his house was shelled in 2017, found himself unable to see the old friends whose support he and his family relied on. 
Lockdown was eased two weeks ago, but the economic crisis resulting from the pandemic has left Sattar's friends unable to help him to the same degree. 
The 39-year-old says his best hope is the government compensation that hundreds of civilians in Mosul were promised after being injured during the campaign by Iraqi and U.S. forces to liberate the city from Islamic State. But three years on, Sattar still waits.
Sattar used to work as a porter at Mosul's Bab Al-Saray market, pushing merchants' goods on a wooden cart through the Old City's narrow streets.
Today, his former home, where his mother and sister died in the bombing is nothing but a pile of rubble. All his belongings and all his memories were destroyed, he said.
""Since the liberation, I depend on God and on charitable people"", he said. Since lockdown eased he goes to the market where he once worked and where he receives food, other necessities and small amounts of cash from old friends.
""At times, I was unable to feed my children"", Sattar says of the lockdown. He lives with three of his boys while a fourth child is being raised by relatives. 
Mirwa Salim, who heads the Fajir Al-Hadba volunteer group that assists victims of the war, said it is taking a lot of time for those eligible to receive compensation.
""Recently, more compensation requests were processed, but under very difficult conditions. Each case needs about two or three years. Some of them have not yet received any compensation"", he said. 
The head of the compensations' committee of Iraq's Nineveh governorate, Oglah Al-Juhayshie, said that ""patients have to provide a medical report to prove their case, sometimes we have to get a written statement from their doctor."" 
This can prove difficult, he added, given that the medic who treated the applicant three years ago at the time of their injuries might have passed away, moved to an unknown address or was a member of the Islamic State.
When Sattar tried to apply, he managed to provide certificates from some agencies but he was then asked to bring a doctor's certificate.
""Where am I supposed to get it, given that the doctor who amputated my legs was an American?,"" he asked.

Al-Juhayshie said if a victim cannot get a medical report and can't reach the doctor who treated him, he can get a medical report from the forensic authority in Mosul, and witnesses from the neighbourhood and the mayor.

Drivers abandoned four trucks carrying the migrants from Nigeria, Togo, Mali and Ghana with no food or water about 230 km (143 miles) north of the Sahara crossroad town of Niger's Dirkou after spotting military vehicles.
Three days later, an IOM rescue team found the group, which included children, by chance on Sept. 3. Many were dehydrated, injured and in need of immediate medical assistance.
Spokesman Paul Dillon told Reuters it was not unusual for smugglers, who tend to take payment upfront from people desperate to reach Europe, to abandon their passengers if they fear they will be intercepted.
""Sometimes smugglers return without their passengers. It's not a rare event,"" he said. ""They know the consequences of leaving people stranded in the desert. It's very troubling this disregard for human life.""
Since 2016, IOM has helped rescue over 20,000 migrants from the Sahara desert - one of the most perilous parts of the journey for West Africans risking their lives to seek jobs in Europe.
The rescue teams have helped 321 people so far this year, excluding the latest group. 
But sometimes they just find remains.
""Past SAR operations have recovered bodies buried in the sand,"" Dillon said, referring to joint operations with Niger authorities. ""It's a vast space and there are many, many routes north and we don't have resources for patrols,"" he added.

The royal bath at Meroe, a basin that fills during the annual flooding of the Nile, was at risk from unprecedented water levels, and teams have been working since Monday to protect the site from being swamped, said Hatem al-Nour, director of Sudan's antiquities and museums authority.
Meroe is an ancient city on the east bank of the River Nile about 200 km (125 miles) northeast of the capital Khartoum. It was the capital of the Kush dynasty that ruled from the early 6th century B.C. 
At Nuri, about 350 km north of Khartoum, tombs buried 7-10 metres underneath pyramids had been affected by a rise in groundwater, Nour said.
The Nuri pyramids include the tomb of Taharqa, who ruled over lands in modern day Sudan and Egypt in the 7th century B.C. They are an ""invaluable historical relic"", Nour said.
As in Egypt, local dynasties buried members of the royal family in pyramid tombs.

Floods in Sudan have left at least 102 people dead and destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of homes, according to the interior ministry. Authorities have declared a three-month state of emergency.

The crisis is seen as the biggest threat to Lebanon's stability since its 1975-90 civil war. 
One person was killed and two were wounded in the clash on Monday night in al-Tariq al-Jadida, a mainly Sunni neighbourhood of Beirut. The army said machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades were used in the confrontation which a military source said spiralled out of a personal dispute between individuals.
A gunfight also broke out on Monday in northern area of Lebanon, forcing the army to intervene. In another incident in the Bekaa Valley town of Baalbek, a man was killed in a revenge-driven killing, the National News Agency (NNA) reported.
The incidents, along with other deadly violence in the last month, reflect a breakdown in state authority, the military source said, adding: ""There is no longer respect for the state.""
Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Latif Derian told interior minister General Mohammed Fahmi that citizens must be ""alert and wise and not be drawn into strife, as no dispute is solved with weapons"". 
Lebanon's economic crisis, caused by years of industrial-scale state corruption and mismanagement, has worsened hardship in the nation of about 6 million, as the currency has collapsed, driving up unemployment and plunging many into poverty.
The crisis forced the government to quit and Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib has yet to name a new cabinet, which he has said will be in place by mid-September, under pressure from France, which is leading an international push for reforms.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brussels has asked its residents to pick a new name for the King Leopold II road tunnel in a step aimed at coming to terms with Belgium's colonial past and addressing gender inequality. 
A statue of Leopold II - whose colonial rule at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries cost millions of lives in central Africa - was removed by activists in Brussels in June amid Black Lives Matter protests.
Now Brussels wants to rename part of its traffic ring road after renovations next year.
""We know that Leopold II is a very controversial figure in our history. We need to start a course of decolonisation of the public space,"" the region's minister in charge of mobility and public works, Elke van den Brandt, said. 
She said an expert panel, including specialists in colonial history and women's rights, would select a shortlist of names for the tunnel. Just 6% of streets in Brussels are named after women, official data shows.
Brusselites will choose the new name from the shortlist. Results will be announced later this year. 
Many Belgians remain ignorant of their country's harsh colonial rule that used slave labour to harvest goods including rubber. The proceeds laid the foundation for the modern-era prosperity of Belgium, a country of 11.5 million people and home to European Union institutions. 
""This is a very good idea because we start being made aware in school of the crimes that (Leopold II) committed. Changing to a woman's name, I find that good for equality,"" said 17-year-old high school student Romain Noppe. 
Rwandan nurse Theogene Fatakanwa, 49, who lives in Brussels and regularly uses the tunnel, agreed. ""If it is a matter of changing (the name) because of the history of Congo, then we are on a good path,"" she said. 
But 71-year-old Brusselite Alain Moons said: ""Even if (Leopold II) has done things that are not right, that is no reason to erase history.""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Yudy Tovar would like to believe that hope is the last thing ever lost. But Tovar, who was forcibly recruited and sexually abused as a teenager by Colombia's now-disbanded FARC rebels, says the chances for justice in hers and thousands of similar cases are close to nil.
She is among thousands of survivors who will be watching closely when former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) leader Rodrigo Londono testifies in court on Tuesday about the presence of minors in the group. 
Londono, better known by his nom de guerre Timochenko and now the head of the group's legal political party, is one of 15 former guerrilla leaders set to voluntarily testify before the special justice tribunal created to try war crimes under a 2016 peace deal.
""This is so they can tick boxes, so they can say they did speak, but nothing will happen,"" Tovar, now the spokeswoman for the White Rose group of women ex-rebels, told Reuters. ""It's our truth against theirs and obviously theirs has more weight. They'll get away with it.""
Tovar, who has spoken in Congress and at official national events on behalf of victims, was forcibly recruited in 2005 as she left school in central Tolima province. 
Within days the then-16-year-old was raped by a commander. In the 18 months before she escaped the rebels, 12 other fighters also raped her.
Londono has denied the FARC had a policy of forced recruitment, using his own entrance to the group at just 17 years old as an example.
""According to the laws of the FARC, entrance is voluntary,"" he told local radio recently, before admitting there have been some cases of ""deceptive"" recruitment. Londono and the FARC did not respond to a request for comment.
""How will justice be done this way, if they won't even accept the errors they committed?"" said survivor Angela, forcibly recruited at 22 and who asked her real name not be used.
Angela served five years in prison on rebellion charges, but says she is not recognized as a victim by the government because she cannot prove her recruitment was forced.
The government victims unit and the attorney general's office estimate there are 8,090 children and adolescents forcibly recruited by various armed groups. About 40% have received reparations totaling about $15 million.
But advocates say that figure is several orders of magnitude too low.
Activist Herbin Hoyos, himself a former FARC hostage and the founder of popular one-time radio program ""Voices of Kidnapping"", says rebels who deserted the group provided him with documents and photographs showing uniformed children as young as eight.

""We calculate approximately 39,700 minors,"" Hoyos said. ""I don't see a possibility for justice ... here it's the victims, the children who have to prove to the commanders they were recruited.""

Chakraborty is being investigated by federal agencies in connection with death of her boyfriend, Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, but it was unclear whether today's arrest was connected with that case. The spokesperson did not give any more details.
Rajput's death and the circumstances around it have been at the centre of frenzied media coverage in India in recent weeks, eclipsing stories around the country's growing coronavirus infections, a plane crash that killed 18 people and a sharply contracting economy. 
In a message to media after news of Chakraborty's arrest broke, her lawyer Satish Maneshinde said it was ""a travesty of justice"". 
Maneshinde did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
Chakraborty is under investigation after Rajput's family accused her of being responsible for his death.
She has been accused of abetting suicide, criminal conspiracy and theft in a report filed by India's Central Bureau of Investigation last month.
Television channels showed Chakraborty waving to the media before getting into a police car and exiting the NCB office in Mumbai. Her brother Showik was arrested by the agency last week, local media reported.

NEW DELHI/BEIJING (Reuters) - India and China have accused each other of firing in the air during a new confrontation on their border in the western Himalayas, in a further escalation of military tension between the nuclear-armed nations. 
Hundreds of troops are in eyeball-to-eyeball proximity along the remote border, which erupted in a clash in June that killed 20 Indian soldiers in hand-to-hand fighting.
Both sides have observed a long-held protocol to avoid using firearms on the sensitive, undemarcated frontier, though this agreement has not prevented casualties.
On Monday night, troops of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) attempted to close in on a forward Indian position at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), or the de factor border, in the Ladakh sector, the Indian army said in a statement. 
""And when dissuaded by own (Indian troops), PLA troops fired a few rounds in the air in an attempt to intimidate own troops,"" the army said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that the Indian side acted with restraint.
""At no stage has the Indian Army transgressed across the LAC or resorted to use of any aggressive means, including firing,"" it said. 
But China said the Indians had breached the informal border through the southern bank of the Pangong Tso lake, where tension has been rising for more than a week. 
""The Indian troops brazenly made gunshot threat to the patrolling Chinese border guards who came forwards for negotiations, and the Chinese border guards were forced to take countermeasures to stabilise the situation,"" said Zhang Shuili, a representative of the PLA's western theater command. 
China's foreign ministry said Indian troops had illegally crossed the LAC and were the first to fire shots. 
""This is a serious military provocation,"" spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. 
Military commanders and diplomats have held several rounds of talks since July to reduce tension, but have made little progress to thin out forces in the arid high-altitude that both nations claim and consider as vital to their security.
The latest uptick in tension around the alpine Pangong lake began late last month when Indian forces mobilised to deter Chinese troops, whose movements suggested they aimed to occupy a hilltop India regards as its territory, Indian officials said.
Each nation has urged the other to restrain forward troops who have been locked in a faceoff since April, after India said China intruded deep into its side of the LAC.
Beijing denies the charge. 
""We request the Indian side to immediately stop dangerous actions...and strictly investigate and punish personnel who fired shots to ensure that similar incidents do not occur,"" the PLA's Zhang said in the statement about Monday's incident. 

India and China fought a border war in 1962 and continue to lay claim to thousands of square kilometres of territory stretching from the snow deserts of Ladakh in the west to mountain forests in the east.

MADRID (Reuters) - Wearing colourful masks, the pupils of the Mariano Jose de Larra primary school in Madrid laughed and played on Tuesday morning before their teachers made them form two lines at the gates to measure their temperature.
It was the first day back at school for millions of Spanish children after a six-month break, bringing parents feelings of both relief and worry about a possible rise in coronavirus infections.
""I'm a teacher and I still haven't brought my children back to school because it's not safe yet,"" said Maria Varas, who teaches music. ""For many days we've been working long hours, but it doesn't just depend on us. Families, society, they've got to join us in this.""

With younger people now accounting for more infections than any other group, officials have sought to calm fears that the return to school will trigger a surge in contagion and imposed mandatory masks, smaller classes and regular hand washing. 
They say a repeat of the epidemic's late-March peak, which pushed hospitals to breaking point and killed close to a thousand a day, is unlikely.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's foreign minister Retno Marsudi cautioned the United States and China on Tuesday not to entangle her country in their regional struggle for influence, telling the two superpowers: ""We don't want to get trapped by this rivalry.""
Retno, the chief diplomatic envoy for Southeast Asia's largest country, made the comment in an interview with Reuters ahead of a series of key meetings of regional foreign ministers this week, some of which will include their U.S. and China counterparts.
Military activity in the South China Sea has increased this year alongside hostile rhetoric and antagonistic policy moves from China and the United States, raising concerns among some Southeast Asian states that the risk of armed conflict is rising.
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi have ratcheted up their diplomacy in the region in an effort to persuade members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to be more sympathetic to their positions.
As well as Indonesia, ASEAN comprises nine other states: Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Brunei.
Retno said ASEAN must remain steadfastly neutral and united.
""ASEAN, Indonesia, wants to show to all that we are ready to be a partner,"" said Retno. ""We don't want to get trapped by this rivalry.""
China claims most of the South China Sea as sovereign territory. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei have rival claims to the resource-rich waters.
The United States this year has escalated ""freedom of navigation"" operations in waters claimed by China, including bringing two aircraft carriers into the region for the first time since 2014 and lifting submarine deployments and surveillance flights.
NAVAL EXERCISES
China's Navy has also increased the tempo of naval exercises in the waterway, including testing four medium-range anti-ship ballistic missiles dubbed ""aircraft carrier killers"". Its vessels, and those of allied maritime militias, have also harassed Southeast Asian fishing boats in disputed waters.
Retno told Reuters the escalating militarisation of the South China Sea - and broader U.S.-China animosity - was troubling.
""One word: worrying,"" she said. ""That is the political reality that we have to face.""
She said a joint statement last month by all 10 ASEAN foreign ministers showed that Southeast Asian states were united, dedicated to peace and not taking sides as China-U.S. relations deteriorated.
""(ASEAN has) a good culture, but we have to nurture it. We can't take it for granted that these values will live forever.""
Meanwhile, Retno said she would raise the plight of the Rohingya refugees who fled persecution in Myanmar with the country's foreign minister. On Monday, Indonesia rescued almost 300 Rohingya refugees who had fled their makeshift homes in the teeming camps of Bangladesh by sea. Other refugees have been turned away by ASEAN states.
""It is very important to continue talking with Myanmar about preparing safe, dignified and voluntary repatriations. Until now there's no progress,"" she said.

""When it comes to the humanitarian issue, we do hope that other countries render that assistance. This is not the responsibility of two countries.”

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Two Australian foreign correspondents were flown out of China for their safety, helped by Australian consular officials after being questioned by China's state security ministry, the Australian government said on Tuesday.
The correspondents for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the Australian Financial Review (AFR) sought shelter in the embassy in Beijing and the consulate in Shanghai as diplomats negotiated with Chinese officials to allow them to leave the country, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said.
Negotiations over the two journalists, the ABC's Bill Birtles and the AFR's Michael Smith, reached the highest level of the Australian government, a source told Reuters.
Chinese police entered the homes of the two men, who lived in Shanghai and Beijing, after midnight last Wednesday and told them they were barred from leaving China, Smith said.
""We were concerned it was a coordinated move. That indicates to us it was political. We were the only two journalists left in China working for Australian media,"" Smith told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""It felt very, very political. It very much felt like a diplomatic tussle in the broader Australia-China relationship,"" Birtles told ABC television on Tuesday.
The Australian government had earlier warned the two men to leave China, as tension escalated over the detention of another Australian citizen, Chinese state television anchor Cheng Lei.
Cheng was detained on suspicion of criminal activities endangering national security, China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday. 
Police arrived before the men could catch flights booked for Thursday, however.
""At 12.30 a.m. I was woken by a huge pounding on my front door,"" Smith recalled.
Seven police officers entered his home, surrounding him and recording him on video as they read out a statement designating him a person of interest in a national security investigation, though he was not the subject of the case.
""They put a spotlight on my face. It was intimidating. I was getting quite scared,"" he said.
Australian consular officials decided ""it was best"" the duo be able to stay with Australian officials on Australian premises while the issues were tackled, Payne told radio station 2GB.
Smith said he was taken in a car with diplomatic plates and a consular officer collected his packed bags.
Both men stayed with Australian officials for five days until a resolution was reached in which the two agreed to be interviewed by Chinese security officials.
Smith was driven by diplomatic escort to a Shanghai hotel on Monday afternoon, where he was questioned for an hour about Cheng, whom he had once encountered briefly but never spoken to, and Hong Kong, among other topics.
Australian consular officials accompanied the two to Shanghai airport and to the gate.
""DEEPLY REGRETTABLE""
""This incident targeting two journalists, who were going about their normal reporting duties, is both regrettable and disturbing,"" the Australian Financial Review said in a statement. 
Their departure leaves Australian media organisations with no correspondent in China for the first time since the 1970s.
""It is disappointing that after many years, Australia will not have a media organisation present in China,"" Payne told reporters.
On Tuesday, China's foreign ministry said the questioning of the men was a normal enforcement of the law, to which authorities had strictly adhered during their investigations.
Australia has a tense diplomatic relationship with China, which worsened this year after Beijing vowed trade reprisals and said it was angered by Australia's call for an international inquiry into the source of the coronavirus pandemic.
Australia had issued a travel warning in July that citizens could be at risk of arbitrary detention in China, advice Payne said ""remains appropriate and unchanged"".
The incident comes as foreign journalists face greater difficulty in China. The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC) says a record number of 17 were expelled, through cancellation of credentials, in the first half of 2020.
""The effort to keep foreign journalists in China against their will marks a significant escalation of an ongoing, sustained Chinese government assault on media freedoms,"" the FCCC said in a statement.

""The FCCC denounces this extraordinary erosion of media freedoms leading foreign journalists to fear that they could be targets of China's hostage diplomacy,"" it said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Environmental factors such as air pollution and heatwaves exacerbated by climate change contribute to around 13% of all deaths in Europe, the European Environment Agency (EEA) said on Tuesday.
A total of 630,000 deaths in the European Union's 27 countries plus Britain were attributable to environmental factors in 2012, the latest year for which data are available, EEA said in a report.
""These deaths are preventable and can be significantly reduced through efforts to improve environmental quality,"" it said.
Air pollution is the biggest environmental health risk in Europe, contributing to more than 400,000 premature deaths each year. Prolonged exposure to pollutants can cause diabetes, lung disease and cancer, and early evidence suggests air pollution may be linked to higher death rates among COVID-19 patients.
Europe's pollution levels plummeted amid lockdowns imposed during the coronavirus pandemic, but the dip is expected to be temporary and most EU countries are on course to miss their targets to cut air pollutants in the next decade.
EEA said the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the connection between the environment and human health, demonstrating the increased risk of passing diseases from animals to humans as a result of environmental degradation and meat production. 
""COVID-19 has been yet another wake-up call, making us acutely aware of the relationship between our ecosystems and our health,"" EU health chief Stella Kyriakides said in a statement.
The European Commission has proposed EU targets to make agriculture more sustainable, by ringfencing natural habitats and curbing pesticide use, although farming groups have warned the goals could curb crop yields.

EEA said drinking water quality is consistently high across the EU, but it raised the alarm over the release of antibiotics through waste water treatment plants, which can spread antimicrobial resistance. Infections from drug-resistant bacteria cause roughly 25,000 deaths in the EU each year.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte was visiting Beirut a week after a trip by French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been leading international efforts to push through major reforms in Lebanon to end decades of state corruption and mismanagement.
""Now is the time to look ahead and build trust between the citizens and institutions, and to turn a new page in Lebanon's history,"" Conte said after talks with Lebanese President Michel Aoun, adding Italy and the European Union were ready to help.
He comments were carried in Arabic by the Lebanese national news agency and broadcasters.
During last week's visit, Macron said Lebanese politicians, who usually bicker for months over forming a new government, had promised to agree on a new cabinet under Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib in just two weeks, by mid-September.
The swift formation of a new government is the first step in a list of demands laid out in a French political roadmap that should open the way for Lebanon to receive billions of dollars in aid needed to get the heavily indebted nation back on its feet.
Those aid pledges of help, first made at an international conference in 2018, were never delivered because Lebanon's previous governments never carried out promised reforms to the system.
Adib will need to have a cabinet in pace by early next week to stay on track but, unlike in previous efforts to form a government, there has been little public discussion of ministerial names and public party haggling over posts.
Lebanese media and political sources say Adib has proposed a smaller than usual cabinet of about 14 ministers, instead of the usual 24 or so. But the prime minister-designate, a former ambassador to Berlin, has not made any public statements.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The top United Nations human rights official called on Russia on Tuesday to conduct, or cooperate with, a full independent investigation into Germany's findings that opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent.
Navalny has been removed from a medically induced coma and is responding to speech, Berlin's Charite hospital said on Monday. The hospital has been treating Navalny since he was airlifted to Germany after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight last month.
Moscow says it has seen no evidence he was poisoned.
""It is not good enough to simply deny he was poisoned, and deny the need for a thorough, independent, impartial and transparent investigation into this assassination attempt,"" Michelle Bachelet, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement.
""It is incumbent on the Russian authorities to fully investigate who was responsible for this crime – a very serious crime that was committed on Russian soil.""
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said her government has concluded that Navalny, 44, was poisoned with Novichok, the same substance that Britain said was used against Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, both of whom survived, in an attack in England in 2018.
The number of cases of poisoning, or other forms of targeted assassination, of current or former Russian citizens, either within Russia itself or on foreign soil, over the past two decades is profoundly disturbing,"" Bachelet said.
Her spokesman, Rupert Colville, cited the Skripal case and the poisoning of Russian defector Alexander Litvinenko, who was killed in London in 2006.
""These are not materials that you can buy in a pharmacy or a farm shop or a hardware store,"" Colville said of Novichok and Polonium-210, with which Litvinenko was poisoned.
Proper legal processes have not been carried out in previous incidents, resulting in ""close to total impunity"" in Russia, he said.

Decades-old tensions between Turkey and Cyprus, which is backed by Greece, have come to a head this year in disputes over commercial rights in the east Mediterranean, an area thought to be rich in natural gas.
""As far as your relations with Turkey are concerned, we are ready to promote dialogue, pragmatically based on mutual interests and in search of decisions, which will be fair and based on international law,"" Lavrov said at a meeting with Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades in Nicosia. 
NATO allies Turkey and Greece are at loggerheads the extent of their continental shelves.
Ankara also disputes the rights of Cyprus to explore for natural gas in the sea area around the island, saying that some of the areas infringe on its continental shelf. Turkey also says the island's estranged Turkish Cypriot community also has rights over any finds.
Cyprus was divided in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by the military then ruling Greece, splitting the island's Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities on separate sides. 

Turkey has no diplomatic relations with Cyprus, instead backing the breakaway Turkish Cypriot statelet in the north of the island.

“Today, our victory campaign has begun,” she said, before hoisting the party's flag at the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) headquarters in Naypyitaw at an event broadcast on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
The election is set to serve as a test of the country’s first democratic government in half a century and is seen by analysts as an important test of Myanmar's transition away from direct military rule as it grapples with crises on multiple fronts.
Suu Kyi, who rules as state counselor, had planned to launch her campaign in the commercial capital of Yangon but cancelled the trip on Monday on advice of the health ministry. 
Wearing a red mask decorated with a peacock, the emblem of the NLD, and a plastic face shield, she thanked supporters for flying the party's red flag at their homes across the country.
“I’d like to say that to make our victory flag long-lasting means making the nation’s peace, development, and prosperity long-lasting,” she said.
The NLD, which won a landslide at 2015 polls that ended half-a-century of military and military-backed rule, is expected to win again though by a lesser margin.
The party remains overwhelmingly popular despite criticism over its failure to curb the power of the army or end escalating ethnic conflicts. It has also faced international condemnation over a 2017 military crackdown on the Rohingya Muslim minority.
Preparations for the Nov. 8 polls have been overshadowed by a worsening outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which is adding pressure on the economy. The World Bank has predicted economic growth to drop from 6.8 percent to just 0.5 percent this financial year.
The country had gone weeks without a local transmission and many regulations had been relaxed until mid-August when cases were detected in the western state of Rakhine.
The number of cases has tripled since to 1,562 and eight deaths. The health ministry reported 93 new cases on Tuesday.
Authorities have enforced a second partial lockdown in Yangon, issuing stay-at-home orders for select townships and banning dine-in services at restaurants and bars. Schools across the country have been closed and flights in and out are limited.
Last week, officials sealed off the capital, Naypyitaw, where the government is based, imposing mandatory quarantine and coronavirus tests for any visitors.

Gatherings of more than 50 people have been banned, and political parties say they are planning smaller campaign events.

Ireland exited lockdown at a slower pace than most of Europe and a pausing of the final stage of its initial reopening plan since July has made it the only country in Europe not to fully reopen pubs.
Bars that serve food were allowed to open for the first time since March alongside restaurants at the end of June under strict conditions. The disparity led to small protests from some publicans over the last week.
The cabinet is expected to agree to the reopening date at a meeting on Tuesday, the paper said. National broadcaster RTE reported that cabinet would discuss a range of dates, also including Sept. 14 and Sept. 28.
A spokeswoman for the government could not immediately be reached for comment.
Ministers have twice set a reopening date for pubs but postponed it after a rise in COVID-19 cases.
Data on Monday showed that Ireland's average number of cases has continued to rise slowly over the past week and is at a higher level than when the government significantly tightened nationwide coronavirus restrictions last month.

The country's chief medical officer warned residents of Dublin and Limerick on Monday to limit their social interactions as much as possible to control concerning spikes in cases in two of Ireland's largest cities.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Mogadishu is a city of ruined glory: crenellated towers crumble by the sea and sand whirls against the pockmarked archways of the roofless old cathedral. But one young man, returning to his family's homeland, walks through the streets and dreams of their future. 
Omar Degan, 30, was born in Italy to Somali parents who left three years before civil war broke out in 1991. He studied architecture in Italy and Hong Kong before returning to Mogadishu in 2017, part of an influx of young diaspora Somalis returning to rebuild their country. 
""I feel extremely sad and angry when I see Mogadishu the way it is now,"" he said, walking through streets scarred by fighting and choked with rubbish. ""It used to be the most beautiful city in Africa.""
The population has swelled since Islamist al Shabaab insurgents pulled out of the city nine years ago, leaving it to African Union peacekeepers and Somali security forces. But Degan worries a building boom is taking place with little regard for civic life. Right now the only public space in the city is the sugar-white sandy beaches. 
""There is no accountability, there are no rules and regulations promoting spacing and design. No public parks, not enough public space,"" he explained. 
The government is trying: it reopened the National Theatre in July and the National Museum in July but repeated insurgent attacks mean citizens cannot just wander in and out: security has to be tight. Al Shabaab still mounts attacks in the city almost daily.
Degan wants the government to set aside some of the city's rapidly vanishing land for public spaces where families can gather in the evening. He had found powerful allies: the former mayor of Mogadishu, and the prime minister. But a suicide bomber killed the mayor a year ago and the prime minister was fired after a vote of no-confidence.
For now, Degan is concentrating on smaller projects, some of which he does pro bono. He's designed a school with gardens in central Somalia, and a public library in the town of Las Anod.
In Mogadishu, the cool white walls of the Salsabil restaurant he designed are adorned with pictures showcasing old Somali houses and men in the traditional mawais, a length of cloth wrapped around the waist. 

""Public space, especially in a post conflict reconstruction context, it means a lot because it really helps the people to take ownership,"" Degan said. ""Having a public space, will help the reconciliation and the peace that Somalia needs and is looking for.""

At a candidacy speech for the premier's role, Suga said the country's low birth rate was a long-term challenge, and pledged to create an ""environment where women can stay healthy and play an active role in the community"".
His comments drove up shares in makers of fertility treatments, with ASKA Pharmaceutical Co Ltd rising 16%.
""In order to broadly support households that want childbirth, we will make infertility treatment applicable to insurance,"" Suga said.
The outgoing prime minister Shinzo Abe’s policies to boost the role of women in the economy and politics, dubbed “womenomics”, was a pillar of his efforts to cope with Japan’s low birth rate and ageing population. 
But Japan's gender gap widened under Abe's adminstration, and the country's birth rate hit another record low last year.
The Abe administration, which has called the rapidly graying population and falling number of births a “national crisis,” introduced free preschool education and daycare services for childen from last year. 
But the government still faces criticism that working mothers are on the long wait lists for their children to be admitted.

While he plans to adopt Abe's existing policies in areas from the economy to the coronavirus pandemic response, Suga said fertility treatment support would be one of his campaign promises.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The rearranged Tokyo Games must be held ""at any cost"" in 2021, Japan's Olympic Minister Seiko Hashimoto said on Tuesday.
Speaking at a news conference, Hashimoto said the Games should be held for the benefit of the athletes, regardless of the challenges posed by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The Japanese government and the International Olympic Committee took the unprecedented decision in March to postpone the Games, originally scheduled to begin in July, until 2021 because of the virus.
""Everyone involved with the Games is working together to prepare, and the athletes are also making considerable efforts towards next year,"" Hashimoto said during a news conference.
""I think we have to hold the Games at any cost,"" she added.
""I want to concentrate all our efforts on measures against the coronavirus.""
Officials from the Japanese government, local Tokyo government and the Olympics organising committee met for the first time last week to develop steps to counter the coronavirus at the Games. 
In an interview with Reuters in July, Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto said organisers were preparing to host the Games next year even if the global coronavirus pandemic hasn't eased substantially.
Organisers are looking at over 200 proposals on how best to deal with the virus, including easing travel restrictions for foreign athletes, anti-virus measures at the Athletes' Village and how to handle spectators.
During his regular press briefing on Tuesday, Tokyo 2020 spokesman Masa Takaya was not as bullish as Hashimoto about next year's Games but said things were moving in the right direction.
Organisers were encouraged that sports events were being held successfully around the world in recent months and that there was the possibility of more fans being allowed into stadiums for Japanese baseball and soccer games, he added.
""This has been a big, big encouragement for the staff members of Tokyo 2020,"" said Takaya.

""We feel that is another step towards ... where we can see sports in action in our society.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Blue Sandford turned 17 in a police cell. Last year, she began an indefinite school strike. Now, the British environmental activist has written a book for fellow teens who want to act on climate change but do not know where to start.
In ""Challenge Everything,"" which was published in Europe and North America on Tuesday, Sandford explains how the failure of governments to heed warnings from climate scientists prompted her to join civil disobedience movement Extinction Rebellion, which launched fresh protests in Britain last week.
Sandford, who was arrested for blocking a road in London's Trafalgar Square at previous demonstrations in October, uses the book to lay out a vision of a sustainable society rooted in a sense of community and connection with nature. 
""We can't all just go and get arrested and that be the end of the story,"" said Sandford, 17, who was arrested again at the end of August in Parliament Square, a focus of the latest protests.
""I think we need to start from a place of science and empiricism and figure out the truth about the climate and ecological crisis, and then act.""
Having spent much of her life living with her family on an off-grid farm on an Inner Hebrides island off the coast of Scotland, Sandford attended school in London. 
She chose to leave formal education in June last year in solidarity with a wave of Friday afternoon school strikes inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.
Sandford has since joined protests to try to stop woodland outside London, where she played as child, being felled for a planned high-speed rail link known as HS2.

""I don't really want to be a climate-change activist,"" Sandford told Reuters television. ""I feel like I've sort of been forced into it because nothing else is working.""

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka has ""better control"" over a fresh fire on a loaded supertanker off the island nation and is looking for any signs of potential oil leaks from the ship.
A fire first broke out last Thursday in the engine room of the very large crude carrier New Diamond and spread to the bridge of the vessel, which was chartered by Indian Oil Corp for importing 2 million barrels of oil from Kuwait. That blaze was doused on Sunday. 
However, new flames erupted on Monday. The re-ignition of the fire occurred on the ""right side of the vessel near the funnel at the rear,"" and is not near the tanks carrying crude oil, Navy spokesman Captain Indika de Silva said.
De Silva said that the fire was still burning but the fire fighting team has better control of the blaze.
""All members of the salvage team have arrived at the scene as more boundary cooling efforts are being done,"" he said, adding ""additional assets, salvage personnel and fire fighting equipment is on the way.""
Sri Lanka has deployed scientists and experts from its Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) to assess the environmental damage caused by the fire.
One team will examine the ocean area where the burning ship is located and another is examining the coastal areas in the island’s eastern seaboard for signs of pollution, said Jagath Gunesekara, deputy General Manager of MEPA.
The New Diamond is about 30 nautical miles, or about 56 km (35 miles), east of Sangaman point, Sri Lanka's easternmost point.

Gunesekara said the experts will assess if the oil leaked from vessel into the sea or damage the beaches and marine life.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A collapse at a marble quarry in a remote area of Pakistan on Monday has killed at least 17 people, and 11 others are missing, police said, adding that the terrain may have been unstable due to the use of heavy explosives used to break apart the stone.
Rescue workers, including Pakistani soldiers, continued to dig through the rubble to find survivors on Tuesday. 
The quarry is located in the Ziarat area of Mohmand in western Pakistan, along the border with Afghanistan. The area is known for its high quality white marble, both sold in Pakistan and exported to other countries.
Between 40 and 50 people were at the site at the time of the collapse which occurred Monday evening, Tariq Habib, district police chief of Mohmand district told Reuters.
""Usually a large number of people work in these marble mines but luckily a majority had finished work and returned home,"" he said.
Nine people were injured. The number of fatalities was unclear because some families took bodies of loved ones directly to their homes from the site, said Sameen Shinwari, a doctor at the Ghalanai District Headquarters Hospital, about 50 kilometres away.
Cellular signals and other communication facilities are unreliable in large parts of Mohmand district, including the area where the quarry is located.
Deadly mining accidents are not uncommon in Pakistan. 
At least 10 workers were killed in a rockslide at a marble quarry in the northwestern district of Buner in February. Thirty workers were killed in explosions at two coal mines in the southwestern city of Quetta in 2018.
In 2011, 45 workers were also killed by an explosion at a coal mine outside Quetta.

The Creek Fire, which has engulfed the Fresno area in central California and caused the emergency evacuation over the weekend of more than 200 people vacationing at a popular reservoir, was still not contained as of Monday afternoon, fire officials said.
The blaze, growing under ""extreme weather conditions,"" had devoured nearly 79,000 acres (32,000 hectares) of land, while a cause remained under investigation, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) said in a statement. 
Officials in Madera County issued evacuation orders and urged the county's 157,000 residents to leave if they felt unsafe.

The Oak Fire in Mendocino County started burning around 1:26 pm on Monday afternoon, according to CalFire, and three hours later it had already torched 1,000 acres (400 hectares) and destroyed one structure.
Videos on social media showed the fire consuming pick-up trucks as it spread along Highway 101 near Willits, California.

The outages will impact 172,000 customers in 22 counties, mostly in the Sierra Foothills, PG&E said, adding the shut off was a safety measure due to the extreme high and dry winds. 
The California Independent Systems Operator, which runs most of the state’s power grid, again urged consumers to cut back on energy consumption and said it was monitoring wildfires throughout the state threatening power lines.
In Southern California, east of San Diego, more than 400 firefighters battled the Valley Fire, which burned more than 17,000 acres (6,900 hectares)in Cleveland National Forest. Video shared on social media showed firefighters dousing the flames, the air thick with ash and fire embers. 
The blaze was 3% contained on Monday evening. Officials announced the deployment of military aircraft on Monday afternoon to help fight the flames.
A fire in San Bernardino County, southeast of Los Angeles, that officials said was caused by a pyrotechnic device used during a gender reveal party, kept burning through the night and was 7% contained as of Monday morning. 

On Sunday, California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Fresno, Madera, Mariposa, San Bernardino and San Diego counties due to the wildfires, which also prompted the U.S. Forest Service to temporarily close some national forests including the Sierra National Forest, the Angeles National Forest and the San Bernardino National Forest.

1098,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 01:00AM ET</span>",China Proposes Global Data Rules to Counter U.S. Moves on TikTok,"(Bloomberg) -- China on Tuesday outlined a slate of rules designed to prevent foreign governments from acquiring data stored locally, seeking to counter Washington’s accusations that services like TikTok and WeChat share sensitive user information with Beijing.
Foreign Minister Wang Yi unveiled the proposals governing global data security after raising the plan with his Group of 20 counterparts last week, part of China’s attempts to set global standards for the digital sphere. They involve forbidding governments from gaining access to data acquired by companies’ overseas operations, according to a statement posted on the ministry’s website.
The guidelines reinforce Beijing’s long-held concept of data sovereignty, or limiting information flow across borders, an idea gaining momentum as concerns over national security increase. The Trump administration has banned ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.’s WeChat and sanctioned Huawei Technologies Co., accusing them of sharing Americans’ data with the Chinese government.
“To reduce the deficit in global digital governance, countries face a pressing need to step up communication and coordination, build up mutual trust and deepen cooperation with one another,” Wang said in the statement.

Washington’s moves against TikTok and WeChat underscore how the concept of an internet decoupling is becoming reality. The control of data -- everything from private details like locations and emails to sophisticated mined information such as personal profiles and online behavior -- is a key facet of China’s broader concept of cyber-sovereignty.
The world’s No. 2 economy already requires foreign companies store data domestically, which is why the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). have built massive datacenter operations in conjunction with local partners.
The Trump administration has sought to set up “clean networks” to prevent China from accessing user data, arguing that Chinese law compels companies to share information with authorities in Beijing. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo highlighted the trust deficit in remarks last month.
‘Distrust Them’
“You have to distrust them,” Pompeo said when asked if the U.S. can trust China. “You have to challenge everything that they say. You need to go verify it when they make a promise.”
There are now few global standards governing cross-border data flows. China wants to fill the gap, saying it’s willing to contribute its “wisdom.” Data security should be viewed “objectively and rationally” to maintain “open, secure and stable global supply chains,” it said.
Under the proposal, Beijing won’t require Chinese companies to share data from overseas operations in violation of another nation’s laws.
Information technology wouldn’t be used to damage other countries’ critical infrastructure or steal important data, the ministry said. Tech companies would not build backdoors into their products and services to illegally obtain user data -- something Washington has accused Huawei in particular of doing, and that the Chinese company has repeatedly denied.The plan also called for measures to prevent and stop the infringement of personal data, and said technology shouldn’t be abused to conduct large-scale surveillance of other countries or illegally collect personal information of citizens. Cross-border data retrieval by law enforcement should be resolved through judicial assistance and other channels, the proposal said.

Speaking in Taipei at a forum attended by top Taiwanese security officials and senior Western diplomats, Tsai said Taiwan stood at the forefront of defending democracy from ""authoritarian aggression"".
While Taiwan is committed to boosting its defensive capabilities, maintaining regional peace and security needs collaborative efforts, she added.
""The rapid militarisation of the South China Sea, increasing and frequent grey-zone tactics in the Taiwan Strait and East China Sea, coercive diplomacy used against countries and corporations...are all destabilising the Indo-Pacific region,"" Tsai said, without directly naming China.
""It is time for like-minded countries, and democratic friends in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond, to discuss a framework to generate sustained and concerted efforts to maintain a strategic order that deters unilateral aggressive actions."" 
She called for a strategy that avoided war, yet conveyed the resolve to protect democracies by encouraging cooperation, transparency and problem-solving through dialogue. 
China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan to accept its sovereignty over the island, which has responded by seeking closer ties with what it calls ""like-minded"" democracies.
This is primarily the United States, but also includes Australia, Britain, Canada, the European Union and Japan, none of which maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.

Apart from the United States, Taiwan's main arms supplier, the other nations generally only offer occasional moral support, such as calling for the World Health Organization to grant proper access to non-member Taiwan.

Chinese authorities arrested the 12 people on Aug. 23 after intercepting a boat off the coast of the southern mainland province of Guangdong. Local media have reported they were headed to Taiwan to apply for political asylum.
""The question is not a question of simply getting (them) back,"" Lam told a regular weekly press conference.
""If these Hong Kong residents were arrested for breaching mainland offences then they have to be dealt with according to the mainland laws and in accordance to the jurisdiction before any other things could happen.""
Lam added that her government had ""a duty to render assistance"" to Hong Kong residents ""caught in all sorts of situations"" abroad and the government's representative office in Guangzhou, Guangdong's capital, will look into ways to provide that assistance and liaise with mainland authorities.
News agency AFP reported on Monday lawyers representing some of those captured have been denied access to their clients. Lam did not address that particular aspect when asked. 
Neither mainland nor Hong Kong authorities have publicly confirmed who has been arrested, but local media have identified some of them as facing prosecution for involvement in pro-democracy protests last year. 
One man, Andy Li, was recently arrested under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing on the semiautonomous Asian financial hub on June 30. Another is a dual national with Hong Kong and Portuguese citizenship. 
The Guangdong Coast Guard, which announced the arrests on its social media platform late on Aug. 26, said two of the detained were surnamed Li and Tang, without providing further details.
It is not clear what charges they face, beyond potentially illegal border crossing.

Lam also reiterated a remark made last week which stoked further worries that Hong Kong had taken a more authoritarian turn, saying the city had no separation of powers, and that its executive, legislative and judicial powers were derived from Beijing.

RIYADH/BEIRUT (Reuters) - A Saudi Arabian court on Monday jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years for the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, state media reported, four months after his family forgave his killers and enabled death sentences to be set aside.
The trial was criticised by a U.N. official and human rights campaigners who said the masterminds of the murder remained free.
Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, where he had gone to obtain documents for his impending wedding. His body was reportedly dismembered and removed from the building and his remains have not been found.
The murder caused a global uproar and tarnished the reformist image of Prince Mohammed, the kingdom's de facto ruler and son of King Salman.
State media reported that five people were handed 20-year prison sentences, one person was sentenced to 10 years and two people received seven-year sentences for the killing.
None of the defendants was named.
The Khashoggi family's lawyer Motasem Khashoggi told Al Sharq Al Awsat newspaper that the family welcomes the ""fair and deterrent"" ruling and is satisfied by it.
""The verdict is fair and deterrent to any criminal ... we as a family opted for applying (Islamic) Sharia laws since the beginning and there is no court in the world that applies sharia rules like in Saudi Arabia,"" Khashoggi told Al Sharq Al Awsat newspaper.
""We have delegated our command to God and to our rulers, who have fulfilled their promise, all our thanks, appreciation, gratitude and loyalty goes to them,"" he added. 
But Khashoggi's fiancee said the eight jailed were not the only ones responsible for the murder.
""The Saudi authorities are closing the case without the world knowing the truth of who is responsible for Jamal's murder,"" Hatice Cengiz wrote in a statement. ""Who planned it, who ordered it, where is his body?""
In December, the court sentenced five people to death and three to jail, saying the killing was not premeditated but carried out on ""the spur of the moment.""
CRITICISM FROM ABROAD 
Some Western governments, as well as the CIA, had said previously they believed Prince Mohammed had ordered the killing.
Saudi officials denied he played a role, although the prince in September 2019 indicated some personal accountability, saying that ""it happened under my watch"".
In May, the family of the slain journalist said it forgave his murderers, paving the way for a reprieve for the five defendants sentenced to death.
In Saudi Arabia, which lacks a codified legal system and follows Islamic law, forgiveness from a victim's family in such cases can allow for a formal pardon and a stay of execution.
A U.S. State Department official said Washington had seen reports of the sentencing and was ""closely monitoring Saudi legal processes"" in the case. ""We call on Saudi authorities to ensure that all involved in Khashoggi’s killing, which King Salman rightly labeled a 'heinous crime,' are held accountable,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.
Many Saudis hailed Monday's ruling in comments on Twitter, a platform favoured by pro-government supporters. Some said the ruling ended one of the most difficult political cases the kingdom has faced. Others said the ruling made Saudi Arabia the ""land of justice"", a ""country where rights are never lost."" 
But Agnes Callamard, the U.N. special rapporteur for extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, accused Saudi Arabia of making a ""mockery of justice"" by not punishing more senior officials who, she said, were behind the murder.
She said on Twitter the trial was not fair or transparent and ""the responsibility of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has not even been addressed.""
Adam Coogle, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, said the conviction of individuals ""does not hide the fact that the Saudi legal process has shielded top officials from any and all scrutiny."" 
""How can the regime be accused of the murder and at the same time it is responsible for the trial?"" said Yahia Assiri, founder of London-based Saudi rights group ALQST.
Turkey, which launched its own trial against 20 Saudi officials in July, said the verdict in Saudi Arabia fell short of expectations, urging Saudi authorities to cooperate with Turkey's investigation.

""We still don't know what happened to Khashoggi's body, who wanted him dead or if there were local collaborators – which casts doubt on the credibility of the legal proceedings in KSA,"" presidency communications director Fahrettin Altun said on Twitter, referring to Saudi Arabia.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Thousands of trainee doctors in South Korea returned to work on Tuesday after ending a more than two-week strike as the country continued to post three-digit rises in new daily coronavirus infections.
The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 136 new cases as of midnight Monday, after the rate fell to a three-week low of 119 a day earlier. The total infections rose 21,432, with 341 deaths.
The daily tally has steadily dropped since it reached a peak of 441 last month after the government imposed unprecedented social distancing rules to blunt a second wave of outbreaks from churches and political rallies. 
Efforts to blunt the latest epidemic has been complicated by the strike launched on Aug. 21 by some 16,000 intern and resident doctors against the government's medical reform proposals. 
The trainee doctors restarted work after agreeing to end the walkout on Monday, though many medical students continued to resist final licensing exams as part of the protest.
The intern and resident doctors are the backbone of healthcare services in emergency rooms and intensive care units, and hospitals increasingly grappled with delays and disruptions amid constant growths in COVID-19 patients. 
Authorities are weighing whether to extend the social distancing curbs ahead of Chuseok, one of the country's biggest holidays this month, which would see tens of millions of people travel nationwide.
President Moon Jae-in said the daily numbers are expected to drop below 100 by the holiday, though health officials have urged against visits and gatherings. 

""Despite moderate declines in daily cases, cluster infections have increased fivefold compared to last month, and continued to emerge from various groups, including religious, medical and sport facilities as well as offices and social gatherings,"" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a meeting.

The activists, mostly masked women, defaced office signs with hammers, pinned up banners and painted slogans on walls late last week, angry with what they decry as insufficient government action to root out the crimes, most of which go either uninvestigated or unsolved by the country's weak justice system.
Their anger intensified on Monday after leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador chided the activists earlier in the day for defacing images of Francisco Madero, an assassinated former president revered by many as a hero of the country's 1910-1920 revolution.
""Those who damage the image of Madero, or don't know his history, are doing so unconsciously, or are themselves conservative,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters at his regular morning news conference, stressing that he sympathizes with the activists but opposes vandalism.
In response, the protesters daubed paint on portraits of more historic figures. 
Standing in front of one of the painted-over portraits, one feminist activist denounced Lopez Obrador for what she described as his misplaced sense of outrage.
""How can you get outraged about this picture, but not about how my own daughter was abused?"" she shouted, banging her hand against the canvas, in a video broadcast by Mexican media outlet Animal Politico. 
Since last week, the head of the government's human rights agency has been forced to work out of different offices due to the protests.
More than 70,000 people have been reported missing in Mexico since the country's military was deployed in 2006 to confront organized crime. Most are believed to have been kidnapped by armed criminal groups. 

Meanwhile, murders of women because of their gender, categorized as femicides, have risen more than 5% during the first half of this year from the same period last year.

Correa, who was in power for a decade until 2017 and currently lives in Belgium, announced last month his candidacy for the vice presidency as part of a coalition to challenge President Lenin Moreno - a Correa protege who later fell out with him.
He had filed the appeal, the last one allowed by Ecuadorian law, before the National Court of Justice to annul the ruling that sentenced him to prison and took away his citizenship rights.
The three-judge panel denied the request by Correa, 15 other officials from his government and businessmen linked to the case.
""The sentence was ratified in all its parts, requiring compliance with the penalties imposed in the appeal hearing, which are eight years in prison ... and comprehensive reparations to the state for $14.7 million,"" the Ecuadorean prosecutor's office wrote via Twitter.
Correa, 57, denies the accusations of financing campaigns with bribes between 2012 and 2016 and has called the case an example of political persecution by Moreno, who was elected in 2017.
""In record time they draw a final sentence to disqualify me as a candidate,"" Correa wrote on Twitter. ""Remember: the only thing they condemn us to is to win.""
The former president also has a pending arrest warrant for the alleged kidnapping of a political opponent.

Ecuadoreans will go to the polls on Feb. 7, 2021, to elect a president and vice president and 137 assembly members.

Speaking with Agence France-Presse, IOC VP John Coates said next year's games will held regardless of whether the world has a handle on the pandemic or not.
The 2020 Tokyo Games were originally scheduled to start this July, but were pushed back to next summer due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The IOC had earlier said they would not delay the games again, beyond 2021.
""The Games were going to be their theme, the Reconstruction Games, after the devastation of the tsunami,"" Coates told AFP, referring to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.
""Now very much these will be the Games that conquered COVID, the light at the end of the tunnel.""
The Olympics officially were postponed in March due to the pandemic. Currently, the Tokyo Olympics are set to start July 23, 2021 and will run until Aug. 8, 2021.
In July, Tokyo 2020 chief executive Toshiro Muto said it would be possible for the Games to be held with a reduced audience, according to the BBC. Every effort will be made by the committee to avoid contesting events with no spectators at all.
Muto told the BBC an adjusted opening and closing ceremonies would not only reduce the number of staff but the delegations from each country as well.
As the medical world progresses on a vaccine for COVID-19, it is not considered a prerequisite for the Games to be held.
""If a vaccine is ready, that will be a benefit, but we're not saying we can't hold the event without it,"" he said to the BBC.
Since the opening of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, the event has never been postponed. It has been canceled three times -- each because of world war -- in 1916, 1940 and 1944.

More than 11,000 athletes from over 200 countries were scheduled to take part in the 2020 Tokyo Games.

Chinese border guards took ""countermeasures"" to stabilise the situation, Zhang Shuili, spokesman for the military's western command theatre, said in a statement published by the military's official news website early on Tuesday.
The statement did not make clear what those measures were or whether Chinese troops also fired warning shots. 
Both sides have observed a long-held protocol to avoid using firearms on the sensitive, high altitude frontier running through the western Himalayas, though this agreement has not prevented casualties.
Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in hand-to-hand fighting in a clash in June, an incident that led to China and India deploying additional forces along the frontier.
""We request the Indian side to immediately stop dangerous actions...and strictly investigate and punish personnel who fired shots to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again,"" Zhang said in the statement. 
The Indian embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside of business hours.

Most opposition parties have said they will not take part in the vote on grounds that it is rigged, but a faction led by two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles has opened talks with the government about ensuring a fair election.
""Engaging in fraud and fostering disunity only collaborates with the dictatorship,"" Guaido said in comments broadcast on social media. 
The pact was supported by the four main opposition parties as well as 33 other parties and political organizations. One of its points calls for ""deepening and escalating the international pressure"" without elaborating.
The United States expanded its sanctions on Venezuela last year by targeting oil exports and seeking to block fuel imports to pressure Maduro into stepping aside, though he has held on thanks to military backing. 
Washington has stood by Guaido, who last year assumed an interim presidency after declaring Maduro a usurper in the wake of his disputed 2018 re-election.
Capriles is asking the European Union to send in observers for the vote for a new parliament.
""Europe has a historic opportunity to help this country recover its democracy,"" Capriles said in an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pais published on Monday.
Capriles has suggested that the Dec. 6 election should be postponed due to COVID-19 and to ensure proper conditions for the vote, though Maduro over the weekend said there was no chance of a change in the date.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza last week said he sent a letter inviting the European Union and the United Nations to send observers and describing ""ample guarantees"" to ensure a fair election.

“We have now been talking for six months and can no longer afford to go over well-trodden ground,” Frost said in an emailed statement before negotiations with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier in London. “We need to see more realism from the EU about our status as an independent country.”
The two men will meet after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned he is ready to leave without a trade deal when the Brexit transition period finishes at the end of the year. Both sides are seeking to secure an accord in time for an Oct. 15 meeting of EU leaders.
But talks have been at an impasse for months over two key issues: state aid -- where Britain wants to depart from EU rules to allow it to subsidize particular industries -- and fisheries, where the bloc is seeking unchanged access to British waters after Brexit, something the U.K. is resisting.
Leaving without a deal “would be a good outcome for the U.K.,” Johnson said in an email to supporters on Monday. “As a government we’re preparing, at our borders and at our ports, to be ready for it.”
Despite the warnings, Frost said it is still possible for the two sides to reach an accord.
“There is still time to reach a good agreement, and I look forward to this week’s face-to-face negotiations where I hope progress can be made,” he said.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Hundreds of people joined a car caravan in Colombia's capital, Bogota, on Monday to protest the economic and social policies of President Ivan Duque, as labor unions try to revive mass demonstrations amid continued coronavirus restrictions.
The protest was the first called by the unions since the country finished more than five months of lockdown meant to stem the coronavirus, which has infected nearly 670,000 people and killed more than 21,400 in the Andean country.
Several weeks of large marches last November and December drew hundreds of thousands of protesters and led to isolated violence and the first curfews in major cities in a generation.
Masked protesters on Monday rode in cars and on motorcycles and bicycles decorated with green balloons and signs in a bid to comply with government restrictions on crowds.
""We have an extremely successful report, it has encouraged us to possibly organize another demonstration on September 21, another in October and commemorate last year's march on November 21,"" Diogenes Orjuela, head of the Central Union of Workers (CUT), told Reuters.
The participants honked horns to reject a recent government decree that allows pension and health contributions to be made based on hours worked, which the government says will recognize workers who earn less than minimum wage.
""It's an absolute trick of the government, to take advantage of the crisis to carry out a reform,"" Orjuela said.
He also voiced concern about a government loan of up to $370 million to airline Avianca and a recent spate of mass killings that the government has tied to drug violence.
The coronavirus quarantine has shuttered thousands of businesses and sent unemployment soaring to nearly 25% in urban areas. 
Marchers last year demanded a laundry list of changes from the government, including protection for rights activists and better implementation of a peace deal.

TEXCOCO, Mexico (Reuters) - Bright green stalks of weeds are sprouting from the ground where planes were supposed to take off at a new Mexico City airport as officials let nature take over in their bid to transform the marshy swath of an ancient lake into a giant park.
The ghostly skeletons of a partly built control tower and flight terminal are recognizably in the style of Norman Foster, the British architect commissioned by Mexico's last president to build a futuristic international airport at a cost of some $13 billion on 4,800 hectares just east of the capital.
Upon taking office in December 2018, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador axed the project, citing the results of an informal referendum, after arguing it would be costly to prevent sinking on the waterlogged soil. 
Instead of the slick design from Foster, whose award-winning glass and steel web-like buildings dot the globe, Lopez Obrador opted to expand an existing military airport.
The abandoned construction zone is now part of a project to conserve 12,200 hectares of marsh on what was once massive Lake Texcoco before Spanish colonizers in the 1600s began draining the water to prevent flooding in their burgeoning settlement.
About half that area is slated for public use, including sports and events space - more than twice the size of New York's Central Park.
Architect Iñaki Echeverria, who is overseeing the project, aims to open a portion of the park by March next year and offer full access by 2024.
""The restoration began the moment the construction stopped. This shows nature's incredible resiliency,"" he said. 
Officials point to recent flooding as proof that maintenance would have been difficult, and say less than 20% of construction was completed. They paid some 13 billion pesos ($603 million) to cancel more than 600 contracts left in limbo.
During a visit last week, a moat of green water had risen around a flying-saucer-like building where a control tower juts 20 meters (66 ft) high, less than a third of its intended height.
Birds glided in a pond beneath columns of crisscrossing steel bars that were meant to become a terminal greeting some 70 million passengers a year. The steel will be sold as scrap.
Conservation efforts in the area date to the 1970s, when the government grappled to contain dust storms that swept from the dry lake basin over Mexico City. 
The current project has been hailed by Lopez Obrador as a ""new Tenochtitlan,"" referring to the centuries-old Aztec capital built in the middle of a sprawling lake, where Mexico City is today. 
Part of Echeverria's work is convincing city-dwellers that the wetlands are worth visiting. 
""People who think there's nothing there, don't know it well,"" he said.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, who has enough backing from the LDP’s powerful factions to win the party vote, is expected to formally file for the race to replace Abe. Two other contenders -- former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba and ex-Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida -- have also said they will run to succeed Abe, who’s stepping down for health reasons.
After the filing at about 10 a.m., campaign speeches start from about 1 p.m. Suga made clear in announcing his candidacy last week that he wanted to keep in place the premier’s ultra-easy monetary policy known as “Abenomics.” Any sign of a departure from it could send the yen surging and stocks sliding, triggering a re-evaluation of the outlook for the nation.
The LDP is set to vote on its new leader on Sept. 14 and then use its majority in parliament to elect that person as the next prime minister on Sept. 16. Last week, the LDP opted for a party voting process that gives more power to lawmakers, favoring Suga. Five of the LDP’s seven factions have lined up behind Suga, who served as the backroom enforcer during Abe’s record-breaking run as prime minister.
The LDP vote is among 394 lawmakers and 141 representatives -- three each from the country’s 47 prefectures. The factions led by Kishida, with 47 members, and Ishiba, with 19 members, are the only ones not lining up behind Suga, who also leads a non-aligned group of about a dozen lawmakers.
While Suga had recently trailed in opinion surveys about Japan’s next leader, the public appears to be coming around to him. Support for Abe’s government soared 27 percentage points to 62.4% in a survey released Monday by news network JNN, with 48% of respondents saying Suga was the most appropriate choice to take over.
Abe’s abrupt decision in late August to step down due to a chronic digestive condition after almost eight years on the job left the party scrambling to find a new leader in about two weeks. The new prime minister will have no more than a year to try and revive Japan’s economy from a pandemic-induced contraction before calling a general election against a recently unified opposition.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has for many years pushed for closer ties with Belarus under the auspices of a unified state, and raised the idea again last month.
Lukashenko has in the past rejected such moves, accusing Russia of wanting to swallow up his country, but now faces protests and the threat of Western sanctions over an Aug. 9 presidential election which opponents say was rigged.
Russia has stood by Lukashenko throughout the protests and says he will visit Moscow for talks in the coming days. 
""(Russia) will now quickly finish what they weren't able to for 20 years, and it is very worrisome"", Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said in televised comments. 
The process of integration between the two former Soviet republics ""can hardly be stopped"", he said, adding that Lukashenko, who denies electoral fraud, had ""neither moral nor political justification to do that"".
Linkevicius, whose country declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990 and is now a member of the European Union and NATO, said a closer relationship between Minsk and Moscow could lead to Russian military being based in Belarus.

Such moves would require a ""mandate from the people"", without which it would be ""a route towards more tensions,"" he said.

Video posted by the Democrat and Chronicle newspaper showed the demonstrators later being wrapped in blankets and led away from the protest site.
Prude, a 41-year-old Black man, died after an encounter with Rochester police in March. His family last week released body camera footage from his arrest, showing a group of officers putting a mesh hood over Prude's head - apparently to prevent his spit from possibly transmitting the novel coronavirus - as he kneels naked and restrained on the street.
Release of the video was followed by protests in Rochester, turning the city of 200,000 people in the northwest corner of the state into the latest flash point in a summer of civil unrest over racism and police brutality.
The Rochester Police Department said they made no arrests on Sunday night as some 1,000 protesters marched through the city after officials vowed to reform policing and address mental health issues. 
The protests in Rochester, like others that have raged across the country since the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police in May, have become fodder for the presidential election campaign.
President Donald Trump, who has been trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden in opinion polls and has been painting himself as a ""law-and-order"" president, tweeted Monday morning about recent protests.
""Rochester N.Y., Brooklyn N.Y., Portland - All had bad nights, all weakly run by Radical Left Democrat Governors and Mayors! Get the picture?"" Trump tweeted.
Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren responded to Trump's tweet in a statement that also praised ""the true spirit of Rochester."" 
""Lastly, I ask that all involved ignore the commentary from the President,"" Warren said. ""It is clear ... his only desire is to bait people to act with hate and incite violence that he believes will benefit him politically."" 

Biden has accused Trump of stoking violence in American cities gripped by protests over police brutality and has defended peaceful protests, while calling for rioters and looters to be prosecuted.

Greece, which emerged from its third international bailout in 2018 and has been struggling with the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis, wants to spend part of its multi-billion euro cash reserves on its defence sector.
""We are in talks with allies to boost our armed forces,"" government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters, adding that Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis will outline his plans during an annual economic policy speech on Saturday. 
A Greek government official told Reuters last week that Greece is in talks with France and other countries over the acquisition of fighter jets. Greece has also been trying for more than a decade to consolidate and privatise its loss-making defence companies.
Mitsotakis will meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Corsica on Thursday, before a Southern European leaders summit (MED7) on the French island of Corsica. The two leaders are expected to discuss the European Union's strained relationship with Turkey, Macron's office said.
Petas said that cooperation in the defence sector between the two countries will also be on the agenda. 
Turkey and Greece have long disagreed over the extent of their continental shelves. Tensions rose last month after Ankara sent an exploration vessel into disputed waters, accompanied by warships, days after Greece signed a maritime deal with Egypt.
Ankara has since been extending the vessel's work in the wider region, issuing advisories which Athens calls illegal. 
The Greek conservative leader discussed the latest twists in the row with European Council President Charles Michel, who chairs summits of EU leaders, during a phone call on Monday.

Michel will visit Athens on Sept. 15, Petsas said.

Abdulkadir Masharipov, an Uzbek national, was handed the equivalent of 40 life sentences without parole, plus an additional 1,368 years in prison, Anadolu said.
Police detained Masharipov on Jan. 17, 2017, and said he had acted on behalf of Islamic State. The jihadist group claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was revenge for Turkish military involvement in Syria.
The Reina nightclub shooting was one of a string of attacks in Turkey believed to have been carried out by Islamic State.
Masharipov had previously repudiated statements to police in which he admitted guilt for the attack, and had disputed the evidence against him, saying he was not the person photographed holding an assault rifle in the club.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - An American bishop-elect has resigned just weeks before he was due to start the job, following an allegation that he had sexually abused a minor, Catholic Church officials said on Monday. 
Father Michel Mulloy, 66, was appointed by Pope Francis on June 19 to be bishop of Duluth, Minnesota and was due to be formally installed in a ceremony on Oct. 1.
It is almost unheard of for a bishop-elect to resign between the time of his appointment and installation. The episode pointed to the continuing impact the abuse scandal is having on the 1.3 billion-member Roman Catholic Church.
It was not immediately possible to contact Mulloy or his lawyers for comment on Monday, a public holiday in the United States.
A Vatican statement said Pope Francis had accepted Mulloy's resignation, but gave no more details. 
The diocese of Rapid City, South Dakota, where Mulloy had served as a priest, released a statement saying it had last month ""received notification of an allegation against Father Mulloy of sexual abuse of a minor in the early 1980’s"". 
The diocese said that when it received the allegation, police were informed and Mulloy was instructed to refrain from public ministry while a Church investigation determined if the allegation was credible.
A diocesan board made up of mostly lay members reviewed the investigation's findings and concluded that the accusation ""met the standard"" for further investigation, the diocese said. 
Mulloy submitted his resignation after he received a summary of the allegation, the diocese added.
A spokesman for Rapid City's police force said there was no active investigation into the bishop-elect. Police in Duluth did not immediately respond to calls for comment.
For the past two decades the Roman Catholic Church around the world has been hit by a raft of sexual abuse cases and has spent billions of dollars in settlements, expenses that in many cases have led to the closing of parishes and schools.
The U.S. Church is still reeling from a Pennsylvania grand jury report that revealed that priests had abused about 1,000 people over seven decades in that state alone.

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>","Explainer: Wrangling over Northern Ireland threatens Brexit, again","LONDON/DUBLIN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain's Brexit negotiations with the European Union have repeatedly snagged - and sometimes collapsed - over Northern Ireland. Why?
THE BORDER
A hard border with customs, security and passport control between the United Kingdom's Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is unacceptable as it threatens the delicate balance brought by the 1998 peace process that ended three decades of conflict between Irish Catholic nationalists and pro-British Protestant unionists.
That created a problem: will the only land border between the EU and post-Brexit UK become a back door into the bloc's cherished single market?
THE SOLUTION: BOTH WORLDS
Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed to regulatory and customs alignment with the EU for Northern Ireland only, but with the addition of a consent mechanism through which the Northern Ireland assembly could vote to exit the arrangements.
So while Northern Ireland would formally remain part of the UK customs territory it would also be aligned to EU rules and remain a de-facto member of the bloc's single market. 
In effect then, the customs and regulatory border is in the Irish sea - between Britain and Northern Ireland.
CHECKS/STATE AID
Squaring the circle on paper was the easy bit: it remains unclear what checks will be needed, and how they should be administered, on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Britain.
Cabinet office minister Michael Gove has set out a Trader Support Service to help businesses in Northern Ireland comply with new bureaucracy of bringing in goods from Britain.
There are also questions over state aid. Any state-aid rules made by the British government would apply to Northern Ireland, as it is part of the United Kingdom.
But if those rules broke EU rules, then Brussels would be able to challenge them in Northern Ireland and by extension across the whole of the United Kingdom. Any dispute would be settled by EU courts.
That is unacceptable to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his top advisers who say they are not scared by a no-deal exit.
FT REPORT:
The Financial Times reported that sections of Britain's internal market bill — due to be published this Wednesday — are expected to ""eliminate the legal force of parts of the withdrawal agreement"" in areas including state aid and Northern Ireland customs, according to three people familiar with the plans.
WHAT DOES THE UK SAY?
Britain said on Monday it remained fully committed to implementing the withdrawal agreement it agreed with the European Union, describing proposed changes as limited clarifications.
London wants there to be no need for export declarations for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Britain and it wants ministers to have the power to step in if required.
The government wants to make sure there is clarification to ensure that EU state aid law will apply in Northern Ireland but not in the rest of Britain. It wants a secretary of state to set out guidance to make clear that is the case.
WHAT DOES IRELAND SAY?
Ireland said that undermining the Withdrawal Agreement would be a very unwise way to proceed.
""International agreements and international treaties have to be honored and they trump any domestic legislation than any country may pass,"" Irish Deputy PM Leo Varadkar said.
""That agreement is in place to make sure we don't see the emergence of a hard border between north and south, something we all want to avoid,"" he said.
WHAT DOES THE EU SAY?
The EU reacted by saying Britain would be shooting itself in the foot if it rolled back on commitments sealed under its divorce treaty with the bloc as it would undermine London's credibility in any international agreements, including on trade.
Should the legal amendments not undermine Northern Ireland's links to the EU's single market or the bloc's own state aid policies, ensure proper controls for customs, live animals and animal products, as well as rules of origin on the sensitive border the bloc might end up not objecting to them. 

However, the devil is in the detail as the matter is fraught with multiple political and technical challenges.

Assad spoke during a meeting in Damascus with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
Lavrov told a news conference Syria needed international help to rebuild its economy. Borisov said Russia was helping Syria to fix its power plants but said oil output could not resume as the fields were in areas outside government control.
Syria and Russia, whose military support since 2015 helped Damascus reverse gains by Islamists and other rebels in an almost decade-long war, had said the two sides planned to boost trade ties and would review energy, mining and power projects.
""The government was determined to continue to work with Russian allies to implement signed agreements and to ensure the success of Russian investments in Syria,"" Assad said, according to state media.
Borisov said Moscow had presented proposals in July to expand economic ties and expected an agreement would be sealed in December on his next visit to Syria's capital. He said Moscow wanted to help Damascus break the blockade of U.S. sanctions.
Syria has pinned hopes on Russia, its main foreign ally, while Western diplomats say Russia's military involvement in Syria has secured Moscow major regional influence and a bigger foothold in a naval base in Syria's Tartus port.
""Russia turned the tide for Assad and with the regime now facing its gravest challenges, Moscow is in a better position than any other time to further squeeze Assad,"" said one Western diplomat who follows Syria.
Although Assad has now regained most of the territory he had lost in the war, the economy is in tatters, leaving many Syrians in poverty as the currency has lost 80% of its value.
Russia has criticised the new U.S. sanctions that took effect in June under the so-called Caesar Act.
Washington says the sanctions, which penalise foreign firms dealing with Syrian government entities, aim to cut revenue for Assad's government and push him back into U.N.-led talks to end the conflict.

He said the suicide car bomb had exploded outside the special forces base.
U.S. Africa Command spokesman Air Force Colonel Christopher Karns said one U.S. soldier had suffered non-life threatening injuries and was in stable condition.
In a statement, Karns said the U.S. military had assessed that at least one al Shabaab fighter was killed during the attack, which also involved mortar fire.
Al Shabaab said it had killed U.S. personnel.
""We attacked U.S. and Somali forces called Danab in Jana Cabdalle village with a suicide car bomb. We killed four U.S. officers, and 16 Somali forces which they trained,"" Abdiasis Abu Musab, its military operation spokesman, said in a statement.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing has held off renewing the expiring press credentials of journalists at U.S. media outlets, including Bloomberg, CNN and the Wall Street Journal, the news organisations reported, amid a tussle with Washington over journalist visas.
The move comes as Chinese journalists in the United States wait for their lapsed work visas to be renewed. The Chinese journalists have been allowed to stay in the United States during a 90-day grace period that expires in early November, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Wall Street Journal's Jeremy Page, who is British, as well as American CNN reporter David Culver and two non-American Bloomberg journalists were issued letters allowing them to continue working in China with their expired press credentials for about two months, the outlets reported respectively.
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday on Twitter that ""we would be glad to continue our excellent cooperation with the U.S. journalists here if Chinese journalists are treated fairly in the U.S.""
""#CNN journalist and a few other U.S. journalists' visa extension applications are being processed, during which they can continue to live and work here with no problems at all"", she added.
The U.S. State Department said China's Foreign Ministry had recently informed the U.S. embassy it intended to further limit access for foreign journalists by denying press card renewals and refusing to process pending visa applications for those expelled earlier this year. 
""The United States is of course troubled that these proposed actions ... will worsen the reporting environment in China, which is already suffering a dearth of open and independent media reporting,"" spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. 
Visas allowing foreign journalists to live in China are linked to their press credentials.
A CNN spokeswoman confirmed that one of its Beijing-based journalists was recently issued a visa valid for two months.
""However, our presence on the ground in China remains unchanged, and we are continuing to work with local authorities to ensure that continues,"" she said.
Journalist visas in China typically last for one year.
A Bloomberg spokeswoman declined to comment. A representative for Wall Street Journal parent Dow Jones did not respond to a request for comment.
The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said that at least five journalists at four U.S. news organisations had been affected, and that the foreign ministry had indicated that the letters issued instead of press cards could be revoked at any time.
""These coercive practices have again turned accredited foreign journalists in China into pawns in a wider diplomatic conflict,"" it said.
""The FCCC calls on the Chinese government to halt this cycle of tit-for-tat reprisals in what is quickly becoming the darkest year yet for media freedoms,"" it said in a statement.
Beijing and Washington, whose relations have deteriorated sharply over a range of issues, have exchanged several tit-for-tat actions involving journalists.

The hospital, which has been treating Navalny since he was airlifted to Germany after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight last month, said his condition has improved and he is being weaned off mechanical ventilation.
""It remains too early to gauge the potential long-term effects of his severe poisoning,"" Charite said in a statement.
Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, was airlifted to Germany last month after collapsing on a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk to Moscow. It made an emergency landing in Omsk so that Navalny could be stretchered off.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has said her government has concluded Navalny, 44, was poisoned with Novichok, the same substance that Britain said was used against a Russian double agent and his daughter in an attack in England in 2018.
Moscow says it has seen no evidence he was poisoned.
The incident has put the future of Germany's Nord Stream 2 pipeline with Russia in doubt as a growing number of polticians call for support for the project to be withdrawn unless Russia helps to clear up the circumstances around Navalny's poisioning.
Merkel's spokesman said on Monday she does not rule out imposing sanctions on the pipeline in response to the suspected poisoning.
Novichok is a deadly group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s.

Britain says Russia used Novichok to poison former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the city of Salisbury two years ago. Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attack, which the Skripals survived. A member of the public was killed.

PARIS (Reuters) - More than five years after Islamist militants killed 12 of their colleagues, staff at French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo say they re-published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad to tell the world they are ""still standing"" - albeit with a security detail. 
Police officers guard the entrance to the magazine's new, bunker-like office, and some staff have bodyguards shadowing them.
""We say 'Good morning' to the cops when we arrive in the morning,"" said Laure Daussy, a writer who joined the magazine soon after the attacks. ""That's not something you ought to get use to.""
The gunmen are dead, but on Sept. 2 a Paris court began hearing the trial of 14 people accused of being their accomplices. To mark the start of the trial, Charlie Hebdo republished the cartoons which, when first published, turned it into a target of searing anger and a global symbol of free speech. 
""It's to show that we are still standing, still alive, still doing Charlie,"" said Antonio Fischetti, who has worked for Charlie Hebdo since 1997. 
Anticipating strong sales, the magazine said it printed 200,000 copies of last week's issue. While before it struggled to stay afloat with weekly sales of 30,000, the first edition after the attacks sold 8 million copies. Weekly sales have now settled back to around 55,000, the magazine said.
Tens of thousands of people protested in Pakistan on Saturday over the re-publication, chanting ""Death to France.""
In France, criticism has been muted.
The rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris, Hafiz Chems-eddine, wrote after the cartoons were republished that Charlie Hebdo should continue to express itself.
Abdallah Zekri, director of the French Council for the Muslim Faith, called on French Muslims to ignore the re-published cartoons. ""I think it's an operation by Charlie Hebdo for PR, for marketing,"" Zekri told the Franceinfo broadcaster. ""I leave that to its conscience."" 
BUNKER
While the years since the attack have not blunted Charlie Hebdo's willingness to provoke, they have brought a keener understanding of the cost this carries, according to current and former staff.
The magazine moved its offices to an undisclosed location that several staff described as a windowless bunker. The magazine also employs a private security firm at a cost of about 1 million euros per year to guard the newsroom.
Body guards provide by state law enforcement agencies are assigned to some cartoonists and writers, according to several Charlie Hebdo staff.
An interior ministry spokesman said the ministry had no information to give on the subject of Charlie Hebdo's security arrangements.
Pierrick Juin, a Charlie Hebdo cartoonist, who joined after the attacks, said he tends not to say where he works when he's on reporting trips. ""You don't know how it's going to be received,"" he said.
On the day of the Charlie Hebdo attack, veteran writer Fischetti was out of the office at his aunt's funeral. 
The biggest change since then, he said, was the mood in the magazine's offices. 
""When I first joined Charlie at the end of the 90s there was this carefreeness. It was a gang of buddies who goofed around, had fun, had a laugh.""

""Now, we're no longer in that carefree era. We've lost that for ever.""

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday pardoned a United States Marine convicted of killing a transgender woman in the country nearly six years ago, sparking condemnation from activists who described the move as a ""mockery of justice"".
Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton was jailed in 2015 for killing Jennifer Laude near a former U.S. navy base. A trial court signed off on his early release last week for good conduct, but was blocked by an appeal from Laude's lawyers.
""Cutting matters short over what constitutes time served, and since where he was detained was not in prisoner's control - and to do justice - the president has granted an absolute pardon,"" Foreign Minister Teodoro Locsin announced on Twitter.
One of Laude's lawyer was dismayed by the pardon and questioned Duterte's commitment to a foreign policy that he insists is independent and not dictated by U.S. interests. 
""We see the welfare of our countrymen are set aside,"" lawyer Rommel Bagares told DZBB radio.
Cristina Palabay of human rights group Karapatan described Dutere's independent foreign policy as ""bankrupt"". 
""We view this as not only a mockery of justice but also a blatant display of servility to U.S. interest,"" Palabay told Reuters. 
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Duterte had ""erased the punishment"" but the conviction of Pemberton stands.
""He is still a killer,"" he said.
Roque was a lawyer in the prosecution of Pemberton and last week criticized his early release, likening Laude's killing to the ""death of Philippine sovereignty"".
Duterte's tirades and threats against United States are frequent and famous, but he has yet to downgrade ties and in June decided against scrapping a bilateral troop deployment agreement central to the defense alliance. 
Speaking on television, Duterte said Pemberton was treated unfairly. 
""This is how I see it,"" he said. ""So release him. Pardon.""
He added: ""There is a time you are called to be fair.""

OSLO (Reuters) - The wreckage of a major German warship has been discovered off the coast of Norway some 80 years after it was sunk in a World War Two battle, Norwegian power grid operator Statnett and a maritime archaeologist said.
Identified this year from images and sonar scans of its hull and of details such as the position of gun turrets, the cruiser Karlsruhe was first detected in 2017 just 15 meters (50 feet) from a subsea power cable that has been operating since 1977.
Built in the 1920s, the ship was later fitted with a Nazi-era swastika that was also captured in subsea images taken by Statnett and its partners, and first televised by Norwegian public broadcaster NRK.
The 174-metre vessel, part of the German force that invaded Norway in April 1940, was struck by a British submarine torpedo shortly after starting its return voyage from the southern Norwegian port of Kristiansand.
The ship's crew subsequently evacuated and the vessel was finally sunk by the Germans themselves, resting upright on the seabed at a depth of 490 meters, some 13 nautical miles (24 kilometers) off the coast.
""You can find Karlsruhe's fate in history books, but no one has known exactly where the ship sunk,"" Norwegian Maritime Museum archaeologist and researcher Frode Kvaloe said.
Statnett said its subsea power cable, which connects Norway with Denmark, would have been laid further away from the wreckage if its location had been known at the time of construction.
The Apr. 9, 1940, attack marked the start of the Nazi invasion of Norway, forcing the government and the king to flee to Britain, where they were exiled until Germany's capitulation in 1945.

Khomenko filed a complaint to police. Reuters has seen an order from an official at the Investigative Committee, which handles investigations into major crimes.
The official instructed him to get his injuries assessed by a medical specialist. Khomenko said he did, but has not heard anything back about whether a case would be opened.
His experience is not unique. Valentin Stefanovich, deputy head of the Spring human rights group, said it had identified 500 cases of police torture across the former Soviet republic since Lukashenko won a disputed presidential election on Aug. 9.
The Interior Ministry and the Investigative Committee did not reply to requests for comment about the specific injuries sustained by protesters who Reuters spoke to and who alleged abuses.
When asked whether cases would be opened against police, the Committee's spokesman said it had carefully reviewed all the allegations, but had not yet identified any cases of police torture that would merit a criminal investigation.
New complaints were still being made, he added. The Committee said on Aug. 17 that 700 people had filed complaints over physical injuries they alleged they received while being detained or in custody.
United Nations human rights investigators said on Sept. 1 that they had received reports of hundreds of cases of torture, beatings and mistreatment of anti-government protesters by police in Belarus and urged the authorities to stop any such abuse. 
Interior Minister Yuri Karayev told state television on Sunday that 30 security personnel were still in hospital with serious injuries.
""They talk about the cruelty of Belarusian police, and I would like to say this: there are no police anywhere in the world that are more humane (and) moderate.""
MEDICAL RECORDS
The protesters accuse Lukashenko of rigging his landslide election victory and demand that he step down, presenting him with the biggest crisis of his 26-year rule.
The president has praised the work of the police. On Aug. 13, he signed an order awarding medals ""for impeccable service"" to some 300 law enforcement officials, including riot officers, police van drivers and prison guards.
On Aug. 17, he also said that some protesters taken to the Okrestina detention center in Minsk had attacked police. He did not provide any evidence.
""It won't be popular, but I'll say it: the people on the receiving end at Okrestina were the people at Okrestina itself who hurled themselves at the cops. You know who I'm talking about,"" he told a crowd of workers at the MZKT plant based in Minsk.
Olga Chemodanova, an official at the interior ministry which is in charge of the center in Okrestina, said she could not exclude the possibility that such attacks took place, but that it was a matter for the Investigative Сommittee.
The Investigative Committee was not immediately available for comment on this issue.
Khomenko said police detained him after stopping him in the street and noticing a picture on his phone of a red and white flag, a popular protest symbol. He acknowledged the image, but said he had not been taking part in the protests.
Reuters interviewed 12 Belarusians who claimed they were subjected to police abuse during their detention or while in custody.
A review of medical records from six of them showed a range of injuries including external and internal bruising, traumatic brain injury, concussion, a vertebral fracture and a damaged knee.
Three doctors at the Emergency Hospital in Minsk who requested anonymity told Reuters that one person with a damaged rectum had been treated there.
Two of them said the patient, whose identity they did not disclose, had said he had been raped with a truncheon. They did not provide the individual's medical records.
Vladimir Rodchenko, a 32-year-old computer programmer, said he had been detained on Aug. 12 for holding up a sign with a portrait of a child who was injured during protests in the western city of Grodno.
The police there said they were looking into the incident, according to local media.
He said officers beat him repeatedly with truncheons across the buttocks and his right leg when he arrived at the police station, and across his arms, legs and stomach during questioning.
He said he had been unable to walk afterwards and was carried to a gymnasium where he and other detainees were made to kneel face down.
He spent nine days recovering in the Emergency Hospital in Grodno and has filed an official complaint demanding a criminal investigation be opened.

Reuters has seen an order from an official from the Investigative Committee, which, as in the case of Khomenko, requested that Rodchenko have a medical examination. He said he did, but has not yet heard whether a case would be opened.

Porto Velho, BRAZIL (Reuters) - Xita, a tiny monkey with sad brown eyes, clutches her newborn tight. Both are fighting for their lives.
Vets at the Clinidog clinic in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) city of Porto Velho believe the mother and baby were run over by a car as they fled fires raging across the world's largest rainforest.
""She arrived stressed, screaming and smeared with blood,"" said Carlos Henrique Tiburcio, the owner of the clinic, as he wrapped the pair in a small, white cloth.
Creatures of the Amazon, one of the earth's most biodiverse habitats, face an ever-growing threat as loggers and farms advance further and further into the rainforest.
In the dry season ranchers and land speculators set fires to clear deforested woodland for pasture. Blazes can rage out of control, fueled by the swirling wind and dry foliage. Wildlife flee from the smoke and flames.
Weak and dying animals arrive at Tiburcio's clinic where four volunteers work tirelessly to save them.
""This time of year, when fires are constant due to the absence of rain, the animals seek shelter in desperation to escape death and end up in the city, putting themselves at risk of being run over or captured,"" said Marcelo Andreani, whose job is to rescue injured animals and bring them to the clinic.
""Human respect for nature is ending,"" lamented Andreani, who works for the state environmental police.
The team diagnoses Xita, a Rondon's marmoset, with a traumatic brain injury. She is wrapped and fed, and her condition slowly improves. Sadly, her baby doesn't make it. 
An anteater arrived with a broken left paw after a clash with a fierce porcupine. The patient had been found hiding in a garage and, again, the vets think it might have been fleeing fires as anteaters rarely turn up in the city.
The fracture required surgery. Under anesthetic, a giant tongue rolled out of the anteater's mouth, earning it the affectionate nickname Linguaruda, or Long-tongue.
After surgery, one of the vets took Linguaruda home to keep a closer eye on her recovery. At one point, she climbed into the bathroom sink to rest.
In five days, Linguaruda was strong enough to return to the wild - the best outcome her rescuers could wish for.
""Our personal and professional satisfaction is immense when we manage to save a life, especially when we manage to rehabilitate an animal and return it to nature,"" Tiburcio said.
""I look at the sky and say, 'Thank you, Father, for everything you did for (me) to be the Lord's instrument.""
Linguaruda was freed near a forest trail, where it eagerly clambered among the trees once more.

1138,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 08:11AM ET</span>",Belarusian protest leader detained by masked men: Tut.By news portal,"By Andrew Osborn and Maria Vasilyeva
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Unidentified masked men detained prominent Belarusian protest leader Maria Kolesnikova in central Minsk on Monday morning and drove her off in a minivan, the Belarusian Tut.By media outlet cited a witness as saying.
Kolesnikova, a member of the opposition coordination council, is the last of three female politicians left inside Belarus who joined forces before an Aug. 9 presidential election to try to challenge veteran incumbent Alexander Lukashenko.
A vocal critic of Lukashenko, she has played an important role in weeks of mass demonstrations and strikes by protesters who accuse Lukashenko of rigging his re-election.
He denies that allegation and has accused foreign powers of trying to topple him in a revolution.
Three European Union diplomats told Reuters that the EU is preparing to impose economic sanctions on 31 senior Belarus officials, including the interior minister, later this month in response to the election and subsequent crackdown.
Facing the deepest crisis of his 26-year rule, Lukashenko retains the support of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has promised to send in police to support him if needed. 
Kolesnikova's abduction, if confirmed, comes as Belarusian authorities appear to be stepping up their efforts to try to halt the protests and obstruct the work of the opposition's coordination council which they have accused of plotting to overthrow Lukashenko. 
On Sunday, tens of thousands of people demonstrated across the country demanding Lukashenko step down. Security forces detained 633 protesters, Belarusian authorities said.
MASKED MEN
An eyewitness, Anastasia, was cited by the Tut.By media outlet as saying she had seen Kolesnikova pushed into a dark-coloured van by masked men in plain clothes in central Minsk.
She said Kolesnikova's mobile phone had dropped to the ground during the tussle and that one of the masked men detaining her had picked it up before the van sped off. 
Kolesnikova's allies said they were checking the report of her detention, and that they were unable to get in touch with some other members of her team too and were concerned about their safety. 
Police in Minsk were cited by Russia's Interfax news agency as saying they had not detained Kolesnikova.
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius likened what had happened to Kolesnikova to something that the Stalin-era secet police in the Soviet Union would have done.
""Instead of talking to the people of Belarus, the outgoing leadership is trying cynically (to) eliminate (them) one by one,"" he wrote on Twitter.
""The kidnapping...is a disgrace. Stalinist NKVD methods are being applied in 21st century Europe. She must be released immediately"". 
Before the election, Kolesnikova had joined forces with opposition presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya who later fled to Lithuania, and with Veronika Tsepkalo, who has since left for Poland. 
Another leading activist, Olga Kovalkova, arrived in Poland on Saturday, saying she had been told she would face arrest if she stayed in Belarus.

The crisis is hitting the Belarus economy. Central bank figures published on Monday showed the former Soviet republic had burned through nearly a sixth of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, or $1.4 billion, in August, as it fought to prop up its rouble currency during the wave of unrest.

1139,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 08:10AM ET</span>","Exclusive: EU to blacklist 31 Belarus senior officials over election, diplomats say","By Robin Emmott
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union aims to impose economic sanctions on 31 senior Belarus officials including the country's interior minister by mid-September, three EU diplomats said, in response to an Aug. 9 election that the West says was rigged.
Almost a month into mass demonstrations against the outcome of the contest, in which President Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory to prolong his 26-year-old rule, the EU aims to punish the government crackdown and support calls for fresh elections.
""We initially agreed on 14 names but many states felt that was not sufficient. We have now reached consensus on another 17,"" one EU diplomat said. ""These are senior officials responsible for the election, for violence and for the crackdown.""
EU foreign ministers gave their broad political approval for the sanctions - EU travel bans and asset freezes - at a meeting in Berlin late last month but did not decide who to target.
As repression continued against the opposition on Monday, the European Commission said EU sanctions would be imposed very soon, but did not give details. 
""There is the political will and determination to have (sanctions) concluded as soon as possible,"" a spokesman for the EU executive told a news briefing. ""It's not a question of whether, only when.""
Greece and Cyprus, which are pushing for separate sanctions on Turkey in a dispute in the Eastern Mediterranean, still need to give their support to the Belarus blacklist. 
All 27 EU countries must agree on such measures and Athens and Nicosia could use their support for the Belarus blacklist to obtain tough measures on Turkey, the diplomats said.
LUKASHENKO SPARED, FOR NOW
Names could still be added or taken off the list, but the diplomats said formal agreement is likely to come on Sept. 21, when EU foreign ministers hold their next scheduled meeting. The sanctions coming into effect on Sept. 22.
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia imposed their own sanctions on Belarus officials in late August. EU diplomats declined to say how closely the Baltic and the EU lists are, for fear of alerting those in question to move assets out of banks. 
Interior Minister Yuri Karaev and his deputy are expected to be on the EU list, along with senior election commission, security and justice officials and ministers.
Unlike the Baltic lists, Lukashenko will not be sanctioned. Germany, who holds the six-month presidency of the EU, wants more time for dialogue and to leave open the possibility of adding the president's name at a later stage.
The EU, which has an arms embargo on Belarus, in 2015 eased economic sanctions on Belarus that were first imposed in 2004, seeking better relations with Lukashenko, but now hopes to move quickly to reintroduce so-called restrictive measures. 
The EU has been cautious about moving too quickly on punishing officials, wary of an intervention from Russia.

Belarus is the ally closest to Russia of all former Sovietrepublics, and Lukashenko's fate lies in the hands of the Kremlin, which must decide whether to stick with him as his authority has ebbed. Lukashenko has threatened to retaliate with reciprocal measures should any EU sanctions be imposed against Belarus.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates is planning to make its first official visit to Israel on Sept. 22 to build up the countries' agreement to normalize relations, a source familiar with the provisional itinerary said on Monday.
Israeli officials declined to comment and UAE officials did not respond to calls seeking comment.
The two countries announced on Aug. 13 they would normalize diplomatic relations in a U.S.-brokered deal that was hailed as a breakthrough by Washington and Israel but spurned by the Palestinians.
The UAE delegation's trip to Israel, which has yet to be finalized, would come in reciprocation of a groundbreaking trip to Abu Dhabi last week by senior Israeli and U.S. envoys, the source told Reuters. 
The source said the UAE was expected to finalize the trip after a date is announced for a ceremony, likely in Washington, where the countries' leaders will sign their normalization accord. That ceremony is likely to take place in mid-September, the source added.
The source declined to be identified by name or nationality due to the sensitivity of the evolving contacts.
The trip would be the first publicly acknowledged visit to Israel by an official delegation from the UAE.
Israel exchanged embassies with neighbors Egypt and Jordan under peace deals decades ago. But until the UAE accord, all other Arab states had demanded Israel first cede more land to the Palestinians.

An Israeli minister said on Monday annual trade between Israel and the UAE is expected to reach $4 billion.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Two prominent Thai activists arrested last month for their roles in anti-government rallies were released on Monday after spending five days in prison for bail breaches, after police told a court there was no grounds to detain them. 
Human Rights lawyer Anon Nampa, 36, and student activist Panupong Jadnok, 24, were sent to a Bangkok remand prison last week when a court ruled their recent political activities were against their bail conditions, which the pair rejected.
But police from the precinct that initially arrested the pair revoked the detention request, saying an investigation into their conduct while on bail showed there was no need to hold them, a Criminal Court statement said on Monday.
""The court considered this and issued an order for their release,"" it said.
Both have participated in near-daily protests in the past two months to demand the military steps back from politics and the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who first came to power in a 2014 coup..
Prayuth last month begged protesters ""not to create chaos"" and said problems can he solved together.
Panupong and Anon have been arrested several times and were among more than a dozen protesters charged recently with inciting unrest and breaching coronavirus-related regulations banning gatherings.
""This is a good lesson to those wielding powers in this country that their use of power must be just,"" Anon told reporters. 
Asked if concerned about mounting cases against him, Anon said: ""Not at all, to catch a fish it's normal to get wet"".
Panupong said their fight would continue.
""They can only lock us up physically but they cannot lock out our ideals and our fighting spirit,"" he said.
Anon is also among several activists who made a bold public call for reform of the monarchy, until recently a taboo issue in Thailand.

A student group plans a major protest on Sept. 19 and Anon said he and Panupong ""will certainly participate""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel does not rule out imposing sanctions on a pipeline set to bring Russian gas to Germany in response to the suspected poisoning of a Kremlin critic with a Soviet-style nerve agent, her chief spokesman said on Monday.
Merkel is under mounting pressure from members of her conservative party to suspend the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a huge project to double Russian gas exports to Germany that is more than 90% complete and due to start operating from early 2021.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in remarks published on Sunday that Russia must help clear up the circumstances around the poisoning of Alexei Navalny or face the possibility of Germany withdrawing its support for Nord Stream 2.
Asked on Monday if Merkel agreed with Maas, who is from her junior coalition partner the Social Democrats (SPD), on the pipeline, her spokesman Steffen Seibert said: ""The chancellor shares the remarks made by the foreign minister.""
It was the clearest indication yet that Merkel could take action against the pipeline, which she has previously supported.
However, Seibert also said it was too early to decide on whether to impose sanctions against Russia over the poisoning.
Navalny, a critic of President Vladimir Putin, was airlifted to Germany for hospital treatment after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight last month. Germany says he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent similar to the one used in an attempt to kill a former Russian spy in England two years ago.
Moscow says it has seen no evidence that he was poisoned.
It may prove difficult to halt the Nord Stream 2 project, which is led by Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) with Western partners, so late in the day.
The project has split the European Union, with some member states such as Poland saying it will increase the bloc's energy reliance on Russia and undermine Ukraine as a transit state for Russian gas pipelines to Europe.

The United States, which is keen to increase liquefied natural gas (LNG) sales to Europe, also opposes the pipeline and has targeted some companies involved in it with sanctions.

The hearings on the case of Shamima Begum will take place on Nov. 23 and 24, the court said on Monday.
Begum, who was born to Bangladeshi parents, left London in 2015 when she was 15 and travelled to Syria via Turkey with two schoolfriends. In Syria, she married an Islamic State fighter and lived in the capital of the violent jihadist group's self-declared caliphate.

LONDON (Reuters) - Julian Assange resumed his battle in a London court on Monday to avoid extradition to the United States to face criminal charges over the activities of his WikiLeaks website, after months of delay due to the coronavirus lockdown.
The U.S. authorities accuse Australian-born Assange, 49, of conspiring to hack government computers and of violating an espionage law in connection with the release of confidential cables by WikiLeaks in 2010-2011.
Assange, clean-shaven and wearing a suit at Monday's hearing, formally declined to be extradited to face a superseding indictment issued by U.S. authorities in June.
Assange is seen by his admirers as a champion of free speech who exposed U.S. abuses of power. His critics say that by publishing unredacted documents, he recklessly endangered the lives of intelligence sources.
He has also attracted more recent criticism over the release by WikiLeaks during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign of documents stolen from the Democratic National Committee, damaging nominee Hillary Clinton. He denies accusations by U.S. investigators that WikiLeaks obtained those documents from Russian hackers. The issue is not part of the legal proceedings.
Assange made international headlines in 2010 when WikiLeaks published a U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache (NASDAQ:APA) helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff. The site later published vast troves of U.S. military records and diplomatic cables.
""POLITICAL"" CHARGES
The extradition hearings started in February but were then postponed for a few months before being further delayed because of a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Assange's lawyers argue that he would not receive a fair trial in the United States on political charges. They have also said he would be a suicide risk if sent to the United States, where they say he could face 175 years in prison.
The pursuit of Assange was part of President Donald Trump's ""effective declaration of war on leakers and journalists"", they argued in court papers. ""He was an obvious symbol of all that Trump condemned, having brought American war crimes to the attention of the world.""
Assange's legal travails in Britain date to 2010, when he began fighting an attempt to extradite him to Sweden to answer questions about allegations of sexual assault, which have since been dropped. In June 2012, facing imminent extradition, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy. 
He spent seven years holed up there. His partner, Stella Moris, revealed this year that he had fathered two children while inside the embassy.

After Ecuador revoked his asylum, he was dragged out of the embassy in April 2019 and served a short British prison sentence for violating bail terms. He remains jailed pending the outcome of the U.S. extradition request.

Ethiopia's upper house said on Saturday plans by the Tigray region to hold an election on Sept.9 for regional parliament and other positions were unconstitutional, setting up a potential clash between the central government and the powerful Tigray People's Liberation Front.
The TPLF, which runs the northern province, has said the vote will go ahead despite pressure from the central government.
Several of those barred from flying to Tigray said the action appeared intended to prevent coverage of the election.
Those barred from the flight also had their phones and laptops confiscated, one of the passengers said.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's office did not respond to requests for comment. 
Elias Mehari, a 35 year-old businessman was heading home to Tigray regional capital Mekelle to see his wife and son when two plain clothed security agents prevented him from boarding his flight in Addis Ababa on Monday. 
""They thought I was a journalist, they took my ID and violently prevented me from boarding the flight,"" he told Reuters over the phone. ""Now they locked us up as they claim the elections are illegal, but I was just going home to see my family."" 
Hager Teklebirhan, a journalist with Ethiopia media Awlo was among the journalists stopped from going to Mekelle.
""We were heading to Tigray to cover the elections, but security officers stopped us at the gate, took our IDs and we were prevented from boarding,"" he told Reuters.
At least three other journalists received a phone call from Ethiopian authorities over the weekend warning them not to travel to Mekelle, they said. 
William Davison, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, was also stopped from flying, he said.
Abiy has overseen sweeping democratic reforms since taking power in Africa's second most populous nation two years ago. 
But the federal government - and major opposition parties - agreed in March to postpone national and regional elections due in August until the COVID-19 pandemic was under control.
A new date still has to be set. 
Tigray, whose leaders dominated the previous administration and have often bitterly denounced Abiy, announced it would hold elections anyway.

Police launched a major search operation in the eastern Cote-d'Or area, involving 40 officers and a helicopter, after a man spotted two people on his pasture on Saturday night, but the suspects got away.
""The operation is over, now we are investigating our findings. For now there are no clues,"" a police spokesman said.
The killings involve mutilation of the animals' bodies, which are often found with an ear cut off, an eye gouged out and genitals cut away. No meat is ever taken from the carcasses. 
From the start of the year to early August there had been about 10 cases across France, but in recent weeks, and despite intense media attention, the killings and mutilations have increased and French media have reported more than 20 killings. 
Police have published a facial composite of one suspect, a male, and advised horse owners to monitor their meadows daily, not to leave halters on horses in the field and to install cameras if possible. It also called on owners to signal all suspicious behaviour near horse pastures.
Later on Monday, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin and Agriculture Minister Julien Denormandie will visit a horse breeder in the Oise region north of Paris where horses have been attacked. They will meet with horse breeders and investigators and will discuss plans to stop the attacks. 

Police have said they have no idea what motivates the attacks and that it could be a satanic rite, a macabre trophy hunt or an internet challenge.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines reported its lowest number of new daily coronavirus cases in nearly eight weeks on Monday, but officials sought to temper optimism and warned of a prolonged battle as the pandemic rages on.
The health ministry confirmed 1,383 new infections, bringing total cases to 238,727, the highest in Southeast Asia, but the least since July 14. It reported 15 new deaths, taking total fatalities to 3,890.
Officials warned against complacency as the economy reopens.
""This challenge of COVID-19 could extend to next year. First of all, we cannot be complacent and ignore the threat,"" Vivencio Dizon, who leads the government's testing program, told a news conference.
Only three-quarters of testing laboratories submitted results on Monday, however, less than the 82% average in the past week.
The Philippines from mid-March to June imposed one of the world's strictest lockdowns, during which new daily cases were reported in the low hundreds. But infections started soaring soon after, as authorities eased restrictions in a bid to revive the country's troubled economy.
The capital and nearby provinces are still under coronavirus restrictions until end-September, limiting the movement of non-essential personnel and banning social gatherings to prevent more infections. International travel and movement between regions remains restricted. 
""We are in the process of flattening the curve but this process can easily be reversed,"" Ranjit Rye, a University of the Philippines professor and part of a research group whose projections and recommendations have guided the government's lockdown measures.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan negotiators have pushed back a planned trip to Doha for long-awaited peace talks with the Taliban as logistical issues are still being worked on in the Qatari capital, delaying the start of the talks, a government and a diplomatic source said on Monday.
After months of delays largely due to a disagreement over prisoner demands by the insurgent Taliban, a government decision to set most prisoners free last week led the major players involved to expect talks would finally begin. 
Negotiators had initially expected to fly to Doha late last week in anticipation of talks starting as soon as Monday.
However the team would not leave on Monday, one government and one diplomatic source told Reuters. 
One of the sources, a senior government official, said the negotiating team may fly on Tuesday. 
He added that the cause of the delay was partly due to the Taliban and officials in Doha sorting out final logistical questions over the opening ceremony, including who should be given time to speak and how flags should be arranged.
These matters carry symbolic weight for the two sides, each of whom have questioned each other's legitimacy to present themselves as governing powers. 
The second issue was finalizing plans for around six prisoners to leave Afghan prisons and be transferred to Qatar, in a compromise struck with the Taliban last week, the two sources said. Western governments have objected to their release.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that there were no ""major issues"" causing the delay, adding that they were waiting for the six prisoners to be released, but technical teams from both sides were working on the issue.
Major players including United States Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has helped usher the talks since Washington signed a troop withdrawal pact with the Taliban in February, are also in Doha in advance of the talks.

The 27-year-old suspect was detained in Selly Oak area of the city at 4 a.m., West Midlands police said. Detectives said the stabbings which took place in four locations over two hours were linked but appeared to be random and were not thought to be gang-related or connected to terrorism.
""Officers worked through yesterday and into the early hours of this morning in a bid to trace the man we believe responsible for these terrible crimes,"" said Birmingham Police Commander, Chief Superintendent Steve Graham (NYSE:GHM).
""Clearly this is a crucial development but our investigation continues. We still need to speak to any witnesses who saw what happened who’ve not yet spoken to us, or anyone who may have video footage or photos of the incidents or the attacker.""
A 23-year-old man died after being stabbed, and a man and a woman, aged 19 and 32, are in hospital in a critical condition after also being attacked. Five others were less seriously injured.

Relations between the nuclear-armed Asian giants have hit a multi-decade low since clashes at their western Himalayan border in June that killed 20 Indian soldiers. 
Both sides have since stepped up monitoring of their largely unsettled 3,488 km (2167 miles) border.
The five missing men are from the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which is also claimed by China that calls it South Tibet, and the Indian Army said it told China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) about them on Saturday.
""We spoke with them on the hotline and told them that it's suspected that some people have crossed across to your side and we will be grateful if you could hand them over back, as per what we do normally,"" Lieutenant Colonel Harsh Wardhan Pande, and Indian defence ministry spokesman, told Reuters.
""There is no earmarked line going through the forest or the mountains, so they keep moving here and there. So they might have gone there, it's a very normal thing.""
He said they were yet to hear back from the Chinese. The PLA could not immediately be contacted for comment.
Separately, a Tibetan member of an Indian special forces unit who died days ago in a mine blast near the site of a border flare-up with Chinese troops in the western Himalayas was cremated on Monday.

His death has provided a rare glimpse into a little-known group of elite, high-altitude warriors drawn mainly from Tibetan refugees living in India.

SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - South Korea hunkered down as Typhoon Haishen travelled northwards along the country's east coast on Monday, a day after the powerful storm battered Japan's southern islands where four people are missing following a landslide.
The storm, carrying top sustained winds of up to 112 km (70 miles) per hour, cut power to more than 17,500 households in the southern tip of the Korean peninsula as it made landfall in the southern city of Ulsan, the country's weather agency said. 
The wild weather uprooted trees and caused landslides near apartment buildings on Geoje Island, off the southeastern tip of the peninsula, according to footage sent by residents to local broadcaster KBS.
At least one person was injured after their car overturned in strong winds in Busan, the country's second largest city, where there was also flooding, the safety ministry said in a statement.
More than 1,600 people were evacuated in preparation for the storm, while more than 76 flights across 7 airports, including Jeju International Airport, were cancelled.
Two nuclear reactors in the city of Gyeongju, around 375 km (235 miles) southeast of Seoul were shut down, according to Yonhap news agency. Entries to national parks and some national train services have been suspended, the ministry said.
In Japan, the Kyodo news agency reported that four people were missing and more than 50 people were injured in the wake of the typhoon. 
The four went missing in the village of Shiiba, in Miyazaki prefecture, after a mudslide hit the office of a construction firm, Kyodo said.
Among the injured were a woman who fell down a flight of stairs in the dark and four people who sustained cuts after the glass windows of an evacuation centre were blown in.
Kyushu Electric said about 290,000 houses were still without power as of 1 p.m. (0400 GMT).
Almost 2 million people had been ordered to evacuate the region, which was still recovering from heavy rains and flooding in July that killed 83 people.
Typhoon Haishen comes just days after Typhoon Maysak smashed into the Korean peninsula, leaving at least two dead and thousands without power.
NORTH KOREA
North Korea, which bore the brunt of both Maysak and Typhoon Bavi a week earlier, is also in Haishen's trajectory with the storm expected to draw near the port city of Chongjin Monday afternoon.
Live footage on state TV, a rarity that has now been broadcast for three weeks, showed trees shaking and waves rising in Tongchon county in Gangwon province bordering the South. The state broadcaster reported that all Tongchon residents had been evacuated. 
North Korea's agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable to severe weather, and this summer's storms and floods have raised concerns over the country's tenuous food situation.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday toured coastal areas hit by Maysak, and ordered party members to join the recovery effort.

LHOKSEUMAWE, Indonesia/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Almost 300 Rohingya refugees believed to have been at sea for six months landed in Indonesia’s Aceh province early on Monday, Indonesian authorities said.
Acehnese police said a wooden boat carrying the Rohingya was spotted by local fishermen several kilometres (miles) off the coast of Lhokseumawe, before landing at Ujung Blang Beach just after midnight
“There are 297 Rohingya according to the latest data, among them 181 women and 14 children,” Iptu Irwansya, a local police chief, told reporters.
Junaidi Yahya, head of the Red Cross in Lhokseumawe, said the group was currently being held in a temporary location.
“We hope they can be moved to the evacuation centre today, but their health, especially related to COVID-19, is our main concern,” said Yahya.
Among the group was one sick 13-year-old who police said was taken to hospital in an ambulance.
Images of the Rohingya arrivals show lines of women in masks carrying their possessions in plastic bags, and men huddled on the floor of a thatched roof shelter.
Monday’s arrival follows the arrival of another vessel in late June when Acehnese fishermen rescued more than 100 Rohingya refugees, including 79 women and children, after Indonesian authorities had initially threatened to push them back.
Fleeing persecution in Myanmar and refugee camps in Bangladesh, the Rohingya have for years boarded boats in an attempt to seek refuge in other Southeast Asian nations.
Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project, a non-profit group focusing on the Rohingya crisis, said the passengers that arrived in Aceh on Monday had set sail from southern Bangladesh at the end of March or early April, bound for Malaysia. 
But both Malaysian and Thai authorities pushed them back, she said, as borders tightened due to coronavirus pandemic.
Smugglers split the passengers into several boats, some of which managed to land in Malaysia and Indonesia in June, but several hundred remained at sea until Sunday night.
The smugglers called their families to demand payments in the weeks before they were taken to shore, she said.
“The smugglers seemed to not want to try to disembark them because not everyone had paid ... They were basically keeping them hostage on the boat,” she said.

Suga, who is widely seen as the top contender to succeed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, told the Yomiuri newspaper the ""the coronavirus pandemic is a huge problem that could not be handled by the health ministry alone.""
The sprawling Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which accounts for the largest budget of all the ministries, is responsible for the country's coronavirus pandemic measures.
Suga also told the Yomiuri it was essential to streamline the government's digital strategies, managed separately by each respective ministry.
The remarks indicate the longtime Abe aide is eager to go his own way and push for structural changes within the government, even as he pledges to carry on with the outgoing premier's ""Abenomics"" economic initiatives.
""As working from home has become more common in the times of the coronavirus pandemic, I think it's evident that the government and private sector need to digitise,"" he told a news briefing on Monday.
The remarks echo ideas floated by Heizo Takenaka, a former economy minister with close ties to Suga, who has said the government should focus on its recent goal of promoting digitalisation in Japan.
""I really hope Suga would push forward digitisation and environmental sustainability, which together would eventually lead to regional revitalisation,"" Takenaka told Reuters.
""It would be good to see something like a digital agency being set up, even if it's only temporarily,"" he added.

Suga is widely expected to win the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) leadership election on Sept. 14, a date set after Abe's decision to step down. The winner is virtually assured of becoming premier because of the LDP's parliamentary majority.

Twenty evacuees were taken to hospitals, the Madera County Sheriff's Department said on Twitter on Sunday, as the Creek Fire that started on Friday night rapidly grew to burn some 45,000 acres (18,210 hectares), forcing evacuations and road closures in the Fresno area in central California. 
""We're completely trapped. There's fire on all sides, all around us,"" said Jeremy Remington, as he stood on a beach surrounded by fire in the Mammoth Pool Reservoir in a video posted on Twitter. Remington was later airlifted to safety, local news reported. 
The blaze was 0% contained on Sunday afternoon, while nearly 15,000 firefighters were battling some two dozen fires across the state, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). 
Late on Sunday, California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in the Fresno, Madera, Mariposa, San Bernardino and San Diego counties due to the wildfires.
His office said that the declaration was prompted by the Creek Fire.
Eight people have been killed and some 3,300 structures have been destroyed over the past three weeks in wildfires across the state. 
Three major fires, including the Creek Fire, were burning in Fresno, San Bernardino and San Diego counties, CalFire said in a statement, adding it had increased staffing in preparation for ""critical fire weather."" 
The agency also said that the El Dorado Fire burning in the San Bernardino county was caused by a smoke generating pyrotechnic device, used during ""a gender reveal party"". The fire started on Saturday morning.
The San Diego County Sheriff's Department issued a voluntary evacuation order on Sunday afternoon as the 5,350-square acre Valley Fire raged unchecked on the eastern edge of the metropolitan area of more than 3 million people. 
""The sky is so thick by my house; the sky is a dirty brown cloud and I live about 25 minutes to the west of the fire,"" Twitter user Cris Mel said in a post. ""It’s kind of a struggle to breathe.""
A dangerous heat wave was baking swaths of the western United States through the weekend, and many locations in California registered record-high temperatures on Sunday. 
The temperature reached 121 degrees F (49 C) on Sunday afternoon in Los Angeles County, a record for the National Weather Service office that covers the metropolitan area.
""This is an historic heat wave for southwestern CA and one that will be remembered for a long time,"" the service said in a statement. 
State officials on Sunday repeated calls to Californians to turn off appliances and lights to help avoid blackouts from an overwhelmed power grid.
Southern California Edison Co (A:SCE_pe) (SCE), which services 5 million customer accounts in the region, was advising customers of potential rotating outages between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Sunday. 
Rotating outages — in which utilities purposely cut power temporarily to avoid broader outages — are rare. They last occurred in the region in August. Before that, they had not occurred in 20 years, said SCE spokesmen Reggie Kumar.

1160,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 06, 2020 10:45PM ET</span>",Japan Cabinet Support Leaps as Prime Minister Abe Heads for Exit,"(Bloomberg) -- Support for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet soared after he announced his resignation and his right-hand man Yoshihide Suga emerged last week as the most likely candidate to replace him, according to two polls published Monday.
Cabinet support rose 27 percentage points to 62.4% in a survey carried out by news network JNN, and by 15 percentage points to 52% in a poll by the Yomiuri newspaper. The polls signal public support for Abe’s overall record-setting run as premier, and an acceptance of the handover to Suga, who is expected to take over in mid-September and continue Abe’s policies, including monetary easing.
While the popularity of Abe’s cabinet had been sagging for months amid a series of scandals and criticism of its handling of the pandemic, 74% of respondents said they had a positive overall view of his nearly eight-year tenure, while 24% said they saw it negatively.
Abe said late last month that because of a chronic digestive ailment he would step down once his ruling Liberal Democratic Party picks a successor. Suga has already received enough support from the powerful factions in the party to win the race set for Sept. 14 over the two other declared contenders -- former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba and former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida.
The LDP leader is virtually guaranteed to become premier, thanks to the party’s majority in parliament. The body is expected to vote on a new prime minister on Sept. 16.
Asked who would make the most appropriate successor to Abe, 48% of respondents to the JNN poll picked Suga, putting him far ahead of his nearest rival, Ishiba, on 27%.
The surge in support could prompt the new premier to call a general election soon after taking office. LDP General Affairs Chairman Shunichi Suzuki told a BS TV Tokyo program Sunday that an early election was a possibility. Another option would be to wait about a year until the new prime minister has served out the remainder of Abe’s term as party leader, Suzuki said.
An election must be held before October 2021 and Suga has often appeared negative about the idea of holding a vote at this stage of the pandemic. The Yomiuri poll found 55% of respondents didn’t see a need for an election until the lower house term expires in a year. Only 16% said it should be held before the end of 2020.
“It depends on the situation,” Suga told Fuji TV Sept. 3 when asked about the prospects for a snap poll. “We’re in the middle of the coronavirus crisis. The people of this country want us to deal with it properly.”

1165,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 06, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>","Hong Kong Tycoons, Banks Claimed Millions in Virus Subsidies","(Bloomberg) --
Hong Kong’s property tycoons and global firms including Ernst & Young and Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. have received tens of millions of dollars in government-funded wage subsidies meant to protect jobs that would have otherwise been lost during the coronavirus pandemic.
While the companies are entitled to claim the subsidies, the payments to developers controlled by billionaire tycoons and financial firms employing highly-paid professionals have raised concerns about the fairness of the program. White-collar jobs have largely stayed intact during the crisis, with the brunt of the city’s recession falling heavily on low-skilled and low-paid workers in the construction, retail and food industries.
To receive the subsidies, companies just had to promise not to reduce headcount below a pledge number, and use all the proceeds to pay salaries. That stands in contrast to wage subsidy programs in other countries like Australia, where firms had to show a steep drop in revenue to qualify. In the U.S., companies including burger chain  Shake Shack Inc  (NYSE:SHAK). returned funds after facing a backlash for tapping a program to support small businesses.
“This is very infuriating, the government turns a blind eye and doesn’t introduce any unemployment benefits to many jobless workers who have trouble even surviving,” said Mung Siu Tat, chief executive at the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions. “But it continues to transfer benefits to big, powerful conglomerates with handsome profits.”
Among companies receiving subsidies in the first tranche of the HK$80 billion ($10 billion) program were Victor Li’s CK Asset Holdings Ltd., which got at least HK$22 million, and the billionaire Cheng family’s New World Development Co., which received HK$56 million via its property arms to cover salaries between June and August, according to government data compiled by Bloomberg.
CK Asset and New World were named by the Hong Kong Retailer Management Association as two of the five most uncooperative landlords in providing rental concessions to struggling tenants in April during the second coronavirus outbreak.

Meanwhile, Henderson Land (OTC:HLDCY) Development Co. was paid HK$50 million through its property-related subsidiaries, and property agency Jones Lang LaSalle got HK$173 million.
CK Asset, Henderson Land and JLL didn’t respond to multiple calls and emails requesting comment. JLL said various industries including real estate had been affected by Covid-19 and the program would help ensure the sustainability of businesses in Hong Kong.
New World Development said it hadn’t applied for the program, but its affiliated companies had done so based on their own operational needs and all subsidies were directed to employees, particularly front-line staff, construction workers and bus drivers.
Hong Kong’s big property companies have suffered losses, their latest earnings show. Wharf Real Estate Investment Co.’s retail rental income slumped by almost a third in the first half of the year, leading to a loss and a HK$7.4 billion hit to its portfolio. Revenue from Hong Kong property sales at CK Asset plunged by more than 60%.
Read more: Hong Kong Crisis Deals $7.7 Billion Blow to Property Tycoons
Even so, seven of Hong Kong’s real estate tycoons sit atop a combined fortune of $120 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd., Central’s biggest landlord, obtained HK$22 million through the program. The company decided to participate after “a thorough review,” it said in a statement. It pledged to maintain headcount of at least 830 employees and launch a HK$100 million relief fund to help people most affected by the pandemic.
The government handouts are based on 50% of actual wages, with a cap of HK$9,000 per employee each month.
The coronavirus pandemic, coming after months of social unrest, has exposed the cracks in Hong Kong’s economy. The city, one of the most expensive and unequal in the world, has little in the way of welfare. The most direct financial assistance Hong Kong workers have received during the pandemic was a one-time HK$10,000 cash handout to all residents 18 and above.

Job losses have largely been concentrated in low-skilled labor as the virus shutdowns and travel restrictions smash the economy. Unemployment in retail, accommodation and food services has more than doubled in the past year, climbing to 10.8% in July. The construction industry has the highest proportion of workers -- 11.3% -- out of a job. Most of the developer subsidiaries that applied for subsidies don’t specifically employ construction workers, except one entity owned by New World.
To be sure, other countries have hit snags with their financial assistance programs. In the U.S., more than a dozen publicly traded companies with revenue of more than $100 million, including Shake Shack and Potbelly (NASDAQ:PBPB) Corp. received loans through a relief program aimed at small businesses.
In the ensuing controversy, Shake Shack returned its $10 million loan to the government. The L.A. Lakers, one of the NBA’s most-profitable franchises, returned a $4.6 million loan they received under the Paycheck Protection Program, ESPN reported in April.
In Singapore,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). returned job support funds it received from the government on its own will, local media reported.
Other recipients of Hong Kong’s subsidies include accounting giants Ernst & Young and KPMG, and large law firms Mayer Brown and Deacons. Various Ernst & Young entities received more than HK$79 million, according to Bloomberg calculations.
In a statement, Ernst & Young said the wage subsidies were “a vital measure to ensure the employment and livelihood of the people of Hong Kong” and it supported the program “as a measure to safeguard the well-being of our people as well as to help boost our employees’ confidence and team morale.”
The amount Ernst & Young received averaged almost HK$26,000 per worker over the three-month period, while the fast-food chain Cafe de Coral got about HK$18,000 for mostly low-paid cashiers, cooks and kitchen hands.
Hong Kong-based Bank of East Asia (OTC:BKEAY) Ltd., which got HK$114.8 million, said it applied for the subsidies to support the government’s initiative to protect jobs and “to contribute positively toward the recovery of the Hong Kong economy.”
Deacons, which received more than HK$18 million, has “taken measures to protect our staff from the impact that the global pandemic has had on businesses,” the firm said in a statement. “The Employment Support Scheme has enabled us to ensure that our staff across the business, including professional, business support and trainees, are protected.”
Both companies said they used the money to pay wages.
Apart from the no-means-test approach, the subsidy program has drawn criticism as employees don’t necessarily get all the benefits. There have been cases where employers -- many of them large restaurant chains -- have cut wages or given staff fewer hours even after obtaining the subsidy, according to Mung. The union has received 216 complaints from workers for reasons including being fired or ordered to take unpaid leave despite their employers getting the aid.
In response to the backlash, the government has vowed to boost deterrence against companies from significantly laying off employees in the second tranche of the program. The application for the next tranche opened last week.
Notably absent from the list of firms receiving subsidies were the major Wall Street and European banks.
“They realize they are in the firing line and need to show the public they are behaving as good corporate citizens,” said Paul Smith, a former global president of the CFA Institute, the global association of investment professionals. “How companies behave in the pandemic will affect their brand value in years to come. Companies that appear greedy and accept government money when they don’t need to will be damaged.”

KIGALI (Reuters) - Rwandan President Paul Kagame denied on Sunday that his government had kidnapped from abroad Paul Rusesabagina, whose widely acclaimed heroism inspired a Hollywood movie but who has been detained on terrorism and other charges. 
At a virtual news conference in the capital, Kigali, Kagame did not say exactly how Rusesabagina had been taken into custody but suggested he had been tricked into travelling to Rwanda before he was arrested. 
""It was not the case,"" Kagame said, referring to accusations of kidnapping. 
""There was no kidnap. There was no any wrongdoing in the process of his getting here. He got here on the basis of what he believed and wanted to do, and he found himself here ... that's how it happened.""
Kigali announced Rusasebagina's detention on Aug. 31, parading him before the press in handcuffs.
The country's criminal investigations agency, the Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB), has said Rusesabagina will face charges including terrorism, financing terrorism, arson, kidnap and murder. 
The Rwandan government has accused Rusesabagina of having a hand in alleged attacks by National Liberation Front (FLN) rebels in southern Rwanda along the border with Burundi in 2018.
A former hotel manager during Rwanda's 1994 genocide, Rusesabagina used his job and his connections with the ethnic Hutu elite to protect Tutsis fleeing the slaughter.
His heroism inspired the Oscar-nominated film ""Hotel Rwanda,"" in which he was played by actor Don Cheadle.
Rusesabagina left Rwanda shortly after the genocide and later acquired Belgian citizenship. He has been living in Texas.
His relatives have accused the Rwandan government of kidnapping him and a daughter has said Rusesabagina last called them while in Dubai, days before Kigali announced his detention.
Rusesabagina has been a strong critic of Kagame's government, whose credit for returning the country to stability after the genocide and boosting economic growth, has been tainted by accusations of widespread repression.
An official in the United Arab Emirates has told Reuters that Rusesabagina was not kidnapped. 
On Thursday, U.S. Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Tibor Nagy tweeted that Washington expected Kigali ""to provide humane treatment, adhere to the rule of law and provide a fair and transparent legal process."" 
About 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in 100 days in the central African nation in 1994.
Soldiers of the then-Hutu-led government and ethnic militia allies orchestrated the genocide in which victims were hacked to death with machetes, burned alive or shot.

President Nicolas Maduro called for the creation of the assembly to draft a new constitution amid 2017 opposition protests that appeared to threaten his hold on power. 
The opposition boycotted the vote that created the body, which, due to vague wording of the constitution, is given unchecked powers. Opposition members accuse the government of revamping the constitution to give unlimited power to the ruling Socialist Party.
""No, that's one of the premises that could be fulfilled by the National Constituent Assembly, another is to recreate the state,"" said Cabello when asked about drafting a new magna carta in an interview with Culture Minister Ernesto Villegas broadcast online. 
""We gave ourselves a mandate ... until December 31, 2020.""
The group has functioned as a parallel congress that supplanted the legislature, which the opposition won in a 2015 landslide. 
Since 2017, it has stripped lawmakers of their parliamentary immunity, sacked the chief prosecutor, and annulled the election of an opposition governor who refused to recognize it.
The creation of the 545-member assembly was harshly condemned by governments around the world. It cemented Maduro's status as a pariah among Europe and the United States, which accelerated its sanctions against his government.
Cabello in the interview said that the assembly's term was set to expire in 2020 and the Socialist Party expects to regain control of the legislature.
The vote for the new congress is scheduled for Dec 6. 
A broad coalition of opposition parties has vowed to boycott the election, though a separate faction led by two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles is in talks with the government for better electoral conditions.

Participants chanted: ""This is not Serbia"" and ""We do not give away Montenegro.""
The pro-Western Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) led by President Milo Djukanovic, which steered Montenegro through the violent collapse of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, lost the parliamentary election last week.
It will not be able to form a government for the first time since 1990, when a multi-party system was introduced. 
Opposition parties, including the pro-Serb Democratic Front, organised rallies celebrating their victory by waving Serbian flags, and raising three fingers in a gesture known as the Serbian salute. 
Montenegro remains deeply divided over its ties with Serbia -- with some advocating closer ties with Belgrade and others opposing any pro-Serb alliance.
On Sunday people started gathering in Podgorica in the afternoon waving national flags. 
""We came alone from Cetinje to give our support to Montenegro, as always. We do not give away (our) state!"" said protester Milo Martinovic, who wore the traditional red hat of Montenegro. 
The final preliminary count gave the DPS 35.06% of the vote on Sunday. The final official result is expected in the coming days.
An alliance of Serb nationalist parties named For the Future of Montenegro, which seeks closer ties with Serbia and Russia and is backed by the Serbian Orthodox Church, won 32.55% of the vote. 
Another two alliances - a centre-right group called Peace is Our Nation and an alliance led by the URA green party - which won 12.53% and 5.53% of votes, respectively, said they would join pro-Serb parties to form the government.

Opposition leaders, along with democracy and human rights organisations, have accused Djukanovic and his party of running Montenegro as their own corrupt fiefdom with links to organised crime. The DPS and Djukanovic deny those charges.

NATO allies Turkey and Greece have been locked in a dispute over hydrocarbon exploration in the sea's disputed waters and the extent of their continental shelves.
Provocative comments and steps by European politicians on regional matters would not help achieve a solution, Erdogan was cited as saying by his office.
""President Erdogan said the attitude shown by the EU in the Eastern Mediterranean will be a test of sincerity from the perspective of international law and regional peace,"" the statement said.
""President Erdogan called on EU institutions and member countries to behave responsibly and remain just, impartial and objective on all regional issues, notably the Eastern Mediterranean,"" it added.
Michel had said on Friday that European Union leaders will decide on a ""carrot and stick"" approach to Turkey when they meet on Sept. 24-25, proposing a conference to defuse tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Last month Turkey sent a seismic survey vessel for hydrocarbon exploration in disputed waters in the region after a maritime deal between Greece and Egypt. 
On Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Greece and Turkey had agreed to start technical talks to avoid accidental clashes in the region.

The following day, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said Greece would start talks with Turkey to resolve a dispute in the Eastern Mediterranean once Turkish ""provocations"" ceased.

The management of the school, which nurtured many of Hungary's most famous directors and film makers, resigned on Monday in protest over the changes, which have also prompted several top theatre directors to quit their teaching roles.
Attendants of the rally formed a chain in the streets of central Budapest before the crowd gathered at a main square outside Parliament, demanding autonomy for the school and freedom for artistic endeavour and education.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's supporters have long argued that it was time for a shift in culture towards conservative values to end what they call the domination of the arts in Hungary by liberals and left-wingers.
""For a university to be able to operate autonomously is the foundation of democracy,"" said Marta Barbarics, who attended the rally.
""If a university cannot teach in a way as its citizens deem appropriate then there are serious problems and the leadership of a university does not quit for no reason.""

Serbia is Moscow's closest ally in the Balkans, but President Aleksandar Vucic has long annoyed Russia by seeking better ties with the West. 
He took a step in that direction last week by signing an agreement to improve relations with Kosovo, a province that declared independence in 2008, which Belgrade and Moscow do not recognise. A signing ceremony was held at the White House.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova posted a picture on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) of Vucic at the ceremony, alongside a picture of Stone from the 1992 film ""Basic Instinct"", at a police interrogation where her character briefly exposes herself.
""If you are invited to the White House but your chair stands like you are in an interrogation, you should sit like in the picture number 2. Whoever you are. Just trust me,"" Zakharova wrote.
In televised comments while on a visit to Brussels, Vucic said: ""Maria Zakharova speaks mostly about herself, and the primitivism and vulgarity she showed speaks of her, and by God, of those who placed her there.""

1175,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2020 11:48AM ET</span>",Russia first treated Navalny for suspected poisoning then U-turned: doctor,"By Anton Zverev
OMSK, Russia (Reuters) - Russia first treated Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny for suspected poisoning, but doctors changed their minds after six hours when laboratory tests came back that found no traces of poison in his system, one of the doctors who treated him has said.
A dispute over what caused 44-year-old Navalny to collapse on a domestic Russian flight last month is straining ties between Germany, where he is now being treated, and Russia, which denies Berlin's accusation that he was poisoned with Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent. 
The chief toxicologist at the Siberian hospital who was the first to treat Navalny, Alexander Sabaev, said he initially suspected poisoning and that he and his colleagues treated him accordingly.
Navalny was put on a ventilator and into an induced coma and given the emergency drug atropine, Sabaev said. This is in line with usual treatments of Novichok victims, a medical source familiar with the German results told Reuters.
But Sabaev said the Russian laboratory findings were conclusive that Navalny had not been poisoned. He now believes the politician was suffering from a serious metabolic disorder.
""As a toxicologist I am sure. There was no Novichok there,"" said Sabaev. 
The immediate treatment Navalny received helped save his life, say two medical sources, as did the pilot's decision to make an emergency landing in Omsk when Navalny collapsed aboard his plane on the way to Moscow.
""If the plane had not made a forced landing, Navalny would not have survived,"" an Omsk-based medical source said. 
Sabaev told Reuters doctors had given the politician three milligrams of atropine in his time there.
He said that was to treat a problem with his lungs. 
Though Sabaev rejects the German finding, the small dose of atropine - used widely in emergency situations - was the right thing to give him even if the dose was modest and administered for different reasons. 
Novichok nerve agents trigger a wave of deadly effects, including slowing heart rate, fluid on the lung and permanent nerve damage across the body. Atropine is one of the first treatments used to counteract those immediate effects.
Sabaev said he believes Navalny had a metabolic disorder, noting his blood sugar levels were four times higher than normal and that he had pancreatic problems. Other Omsk-based medical sources dispute that diagnosis.
SICK IN SIBERIA 
Navalny, an outspoken opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was airlifted to Germany last month after collapsing on a domestic Russian flight. Before boarding, he drank a cup of tea that his allies said was poisoned.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Berlin has concluded Navalny was poisoned with Novichok, the same substance that Britain said was used against a Russian double agent and his daughter in an attack in England in 2018.
Sabaev said the hypothesis that Navalny had been poisoned was shared by the ambulance team in Omsk. 
""We carried out detoxification measures since we suspected poisoning. This is infusion therapy, this is forced diuresis. This is a transfer to an artificial lung ventilator,"" he said.
It was only after three sets of independent laboratory tests came back which found no traces of any poison or toxins that doctors abandoned the poisoning diagnosis, said Sabaev.
The equipment used by one of the laboratories in Omsk, which was not part of the hospital, was of ""expert level"", made in the United States and technically capable of identifying Novichok if it was present, he said. 
Dr Peter Chai, an emergency medicine doctor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said Russian doctors would have struggled to diagnose Novichok poisoning so soon into Navalny's treatment course.
""Confirmatory testing... takes time with complex analytic techniques. This is a nuanced process and I think it may have been premature to suspect this,"" he said.
Part of the problem is that there are many different versions of Novichok - most are still secret - so the exact chemical structure of the chemical agent in question might not be immediately known outside a few highly secret chemical warfare laboratories, Chai said.
Sabaev said he and his colleagues were ready to share the results of 60 tests in digital form. 
In the 2018 British case of the poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, traces of Novichok were found far and wide. One policeman got sick, and a woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after becoming contaminated. 
Sabaev noted there were no signs that the Russian doctors who had treated Navalny had poisoning symptoms. 

""Everyone is alive and well,"" he said.

TRIENT, Switzerland (Reuters) - Climate activists gathered at Switzerland's Trient glacier on Sunday to urge authorities to take action to reduce CO2 emissions and draw attention to the disappearance of ice shelves and glaciers in the Alps and beyond.
More than 200 people gathered at the foot of the Trient glacier, situated along one of Western Europe's tallest mountain ranges, the Mont Blanc massif, to call attention to the impact of climate change on Switzerland's natural landscape.
Their protest came one day before the Swiss parliament begins debating new legislation on reducing CO2 emissions.
""We know that in the last 30 or 40 years, there are more than 500 glaciers that have disappeared or are in the process of disappearing,"" Myriam Roth, co-president of the Swiss Association for the Protection of the Climate, which launched an initiative in November 2019 aimed at protecting glaciers in Switzerland, told Reuters.
""This kind of mobilisation, which is very public and draws a lot of people from all over, makes the urgency visible. It reminds people that this is happening now.""
Sitting at an altitude of 3,000-3,2000 metres, the Trient glacier has already receded by more than 1,000 metres over the last 30 years.
Switzerland's Turtmann Glacier in the same canton as Trient, split in two last month, losing 300,000 cubic metres in a dramatic collapse https://www.reutersconnect.com/all?id=tag%3Areuters.com%2C2020%3Anewsml_RC27BI9U5BUT&share=true caught on camera.
The government says 90% of the 1,500 glaciers remaining--including Trient--will go by the end of the century if nothing is done to cut emissions.

""What we are asking, in the name of the Climate Alliance, is that strong political decisions be taken so that CO2 emissions can be lowered 60% by 2030,"" said Ivan Maillard Ardenti, whose aid group Bread for All supported the event organised by Switzerland's Climate Alliance.

Columns of protesters defied a government warning to march in front of soldiers and military vehicles. They waved red-and-white opposition flags and shouted ""go away!"" and ""you're a rat!"".
The human rights group Spring-96 said at least 70 people were arrested. Russia's Interfax news agency reported that several people were injured when police broke up a protest outside a state-run tractor factory.
Video footage shown by local media outlet TUT.BY showed women shouting ""shame"" at masked members of the security forces who dragged people away into detention.
Lukashenko has been in power since 1994 and, buoyed by a show of support from traditional ally Russia, has rejected calls for new elections from Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, his main opponent who fled into exile two days after the vote.
Demonstrations have carried on throughout the four weeks since the election, gaining in size on the weekends and drawing tens of thousands of people each Sunday. 
The interior ministry said in a statement that 91 protesters had been detained on Saturday, and said it would beef up security and take ""take all necessary measures to suppress such actions and prevent violations of public order"" on Sunday. 
Tsikhanouskaya, who will travel to Warsaw to meet the Polish prime minister next week, said in a video address on Saturday that the momentum of the protests was irreversible.
""Belarusians have already changed, they have awakened and it is impossible to push them back into the former mindset.""
Western countries have had to balance their sympathy with a swelling Belarusian pro-democracy movement against a desire not to provoke Russia into a military intervention. The crisis has tested European resolve at a moment when countries are also weighing how to respond to the suspected poisoning of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, now being treated in Germany.
In an interview published in the Financial Times on Sunday, Lithuania's foreign minister urged the European Union to impose sanctions on Belarus and counter Russia's influence or risk undermining the credibility of its foreign policy. 
""Sometimes we react too late and our measures are fragmented and aren't making any impression on society or the people in power,"" Linas Linkevicius said.

Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have imposed travel bans on Lukashenko and 29 other Belarusian officials without waiting for the rest of the EU to act, signalling impatience with the West's cautious approach.

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain will not blink first in Brexit trade negotiations with the European Union and is not scared of a no-deal exit at the end of the year, the country's top Brexit negotiator warned the bloc on Sunday.
Britain left the EU on Jan. 31 but talks have so far made little headway on agreeing a new trade deal for when a status-quo transition arrangement ends in December.
""We came in after a government and negotiating team that had blinked and had its bluff called at critical moments and the EU had learned not to take our word seriously,"" negotiator David Frost told the Mail on Sunday.
""So a lot of what we are trying to do this year is to get them to realise that we mean what we say and they should take our position seriously,"" he was quoted as saying.
Talks are due to resume in London on Tuesday but they have stalled over Britain's insistence that it have full autonomy over state aid and its demands over fishing. 
Britain says the EU is dragging its feet in talks and has failed to fully accept that it is now an independent country.
""We are not going to be a client state. We are not going to compromise on the fundamentals of having control over our own laws,"" Frost told the Mail. ""We are not going to accept level playing field provisions that lock us in to the way the EU do things."" 
""That's what being an independent country is about, that's what the British people voted for and that's what will happen at the end of the year, come what may,"" Frost said.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the week ahead would be a wake-up call for the EU. 
""We've got to a position where there's only two points really that are holding us back,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme.
UK fisheries had been ""pretty much decimated"" as a result of EU membership, he said, and the bloc wanted to keep British access to its waters ""permanently low"". 
""That can't be right,"" he said.
On state aid, Raab said Britain had led the charge against government intervention since the 1980s, but the issue was ""an absolutely critical element of policy making"".
At heart, Britain is pressing one of the EU’s most sensitive buttons – the fear that a post-Brexit Britain could become a much more agile, deregulated free-market competitor on its border by using selective state aid.
""More and more people have come to the conclusion that Brexit ideology trumps Brexit pragmatism in the UK government,"" said one EU diplomat.
""If the UK really wanted to jump off the Brexit cliff edge for ideological reasons, there would be no way for the EU to stop this,"" the diplomat said. ""If, on the other hand, the UK’s approach became more pragmatic and realistic, there would probably be a good chance to save the negotiations and agree on a deal.""
Frost said a lot of preparation had been done for a possible exit without a trade deal.

""I don't think that we are scared of this at all,"" Frost said. ""If we can reach an agreement that regulates trade like Canada's, great. If we can't, it will be an Australian-like trading agreement and we are fully ready for that.""

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - The Huanan seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, believed by many to be the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, is sealed behind a blue perimeter fence. A large team of security staff chases away anyone who lingers.
""We are just doing our job,"" said a guard in black who ordered a Reuters reporter to delete footage recorded near the market's main gates. He identified himself as a worker from the city government's epidemic prevention and control team. 
Foreign journalists were invited on an official tour to report on Wuhan's efforts to rebuild its economy after the months-long trauma of COVID-19. The official message: the ""heroic city"" is back to normal and back in business, its schools and tourist sites reopened and its enterprises running at full capacity. 
""No other place is as safe as this,"" said Lin Songtian, president of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, a state-backed group that helped organise the tour.
The location of more than 80% of the country's COVID-19 deaths, the central Chinese city on the banks of the Yangtze river has reported no cases of local transmission since May, and most of the stringent controls imposed during a two-month lockdown have been relaxed.
But Wuhan was accused of acting too slowly in the early stages of the outbreak amid fears of disrupting the economy or displeasing China's leadership in Beijing. Critics say media censorship and the silencing of whistleblowers gave the virus more time to spread undetected. 
Wuhan remains reluctant to allow light to be shed on the origins of a pathogen that has killed nearly 900,000 people worldwide. 
The city still restricts access to locations like the Huanan market, which was linked to the first identified cluster of infections in December. 
At another wholesale market in the far north of city, which is open to the public, Reuters was tailed by security staff and deterred from speaking to stallholders and traders.
""If you don't allow people to visit these places, you give people the impression you have something to hide,"" said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington who studies the politics behind China's health issues. 
ORIGINS
China rejects conspiracy theories surrounding the coronavirus, including claims without evidence that a specialist virology institute in Wuhan manufactured it. But many unanswered questions remain about the origins of COVID-19 and the role played by the trade in exotic wildlife in Wuhan. 
Though authorities closed the Huanan market in January, there is a growing scientific consensus that the virus did not originate there. Some studies suggest it was already in circulation by the time it reached the market, with more than one transmission route.
""I agree with the general idea that the virus jumped into a human before the Wuhan market,"" said David Irwin, professor of medicine and pathobiology at the University of Toronto. ""They may have been a trader that had been exposed either directly to the virus in a host animal or interacted with farmers or other traders outside of Wuhan.""
China has shown little appetite for an international enquiry into the origins of COVID-19 or for allowing more scrutiny of its efforts in the early stages of the outbreak, preferring to focus on the country's rapid economic and psychological recovery.
""There is no doubt that China has been very successful in containing the virus, so why can't they be more open?"" said Huang. ""If you want to dispel those myths... you don't need to worry about people visiting the market or even the virus institute."" 

(This story corrects paragraph five to say the last local COVID-19 transmission was in May, not April)

1180,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2020 08:16AM ET</span>","Hong Kong police fire pepper balls at protesters opposed to election delay, new law","By Jessie Pang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Police fired rounds of pepper balls at protesters in Hong Kong on Sunday as hundreds took to the streets to demonstrate against the postponement of legislative elections and a new national security law imposed by China.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam postponed the Sept. 6 election for seats in the Asian financial hub's Legislative Council for a year in July because of a spike in coronavirus cases. 
The move dealt a blow to the pro-democracy opposition who hoped to win a historic majority in the Council, where only half the seats are directly elected and the other half are appointed members who mostly support Beijing.
""Today is supposedly our voting day, we need to resist to fight back for our vote,” said a 70-year old woman surnamed Wong as she marched with other demonstrators.
The poll would have been the former British colony’s first official vote since Beijing imposed new security legislation in late June. The government insists there was no political motive behind the delay.
Thousands of police were stationed around the bustling Kowloon peninsula as marchers waved placards and chanted popular anti-government slogans such as ""liberate Hong Kong"".These slogans are now banned under the new security law. Police said they arrested at least 90 people, mainly for illegal gatherings, in a notice on their Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
Several well-known activists were arrested during the demonstration including Figo Chan, the vice-convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front and former legislator Leung Kwok-hung, also known as “Long Hair”, according to a post on Chan's Facebook page.
Anti-government demonstrations have declined this year mainly because of limits on group gatherings, imposed to counter the spread of coronavirus, and the security law, which punishes actions China sees as subversive, secessionist, terrorist or colluding with foreign forces.
Critics say the law aims to quash dissent in the city, while supporters say it will bring more stability after a year of often-violent anti-government and anti-China unrest.
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a guarantee of autonomy but critics say the new law undermines that promise and puts the territory on a more authoritarian path.
Advocates of the law say it plugs loopholes in national security left by the city’s inability to fulfil a constitutional requirement to pass such laws on its own.
While street protests have largely lost momentum, anti-government and anti-Beijing sentiment persists, with China's offer of mass coronavirus testing for Hong Kong residents prompting calls for a boycott amid public distrust.
Authorities have cited coronavirus fears to restrict gatherings, which are currently limited to two people, and police have rejected applications for protests in recent months.
Hong Kong has reported around 4,800 coronavirus cases since January, far lower than in other major cities around the world. The number of new daily infections has fallen substantially from triple digits in July to single digits currently.

1181,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>",Nigeria to deliver aid by air in conflict-hit northeast,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigeria's government plans to deliver humanitarian aid supplies by air to people in remote communities in parts of the northeast that have been ravaged by the decade-long Islamist insurgency spearheaded by Boko Haram.
The insurgency, which since 2009 has killed around 35,000 people and forced two million people to flee their homes, has spawned one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. Seven million people need some form of aid, the United Nations estimates.
Humanitarian affairs minister Sadiya Umar Farouk on Sunday told reporters in Maiduguri, capital of the conflict-ravaged Borno state, that Nigerian Air Force helicopters and planes would be used to drop food supplies and items such as blankets.
""There has been an issue of inaccessible areas where humanitarian workers cannot reach the people,"" she said at a news conference on Sunday. ""Air drops are especially good for areas we cannot access by road,"" she added. 
Farouk did not provide details of the number of people authorities expected to reach or the frequency of deliveries. A spokesman for the ministry did not immediately respond to a phone call and text messages seeking further details. 
Security forces in Nigeria, which plays a key role in maintaining stability in West Africa, have in recent months battled strikes by Islamists in the northeast. 
Jihadist group Boko Haram was pushed off most of the land it controlled early in 2015 but the group continued to mount attacks in the northeast, as well as neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger. 
A splinter faction that pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2016 has become the dominant force in the region, mounting sustained attacks on the armed forces in the last few years.

BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Police said they were searching for a man in relation to a two-hour stabbing spree in the city of Birmingham, central England, early on Sunday, that left one man dead and seven people injured, two of them critically.
The knife attacks happened in four locations in the city centre starting from 00:30 (2330 GMT), police said.
""We are treating all four of those incidents as a linked series,"" West Midlands Police Chief Superintendent Steve Graham (NYSE:GHM) said. 
""We are searching for one suspect and inquiries to identify and then trace that suspect are ongoing.""
He said there was no suggestion that the attacks were targeted at any section of the community or were gang related.
""At this stage we can't find a particular motive, but it does appear to be random in terms of the selection of people who were attacked,"" he said. 
Britain's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had no information to indicate the incidents were terrorism related but the public should stay ""very vigilant"". 
The first stabbing was in Constitution Hill, police said, and the suspect then moved from north to south, to Livery Street, Irving Street and ending at Hurst Street.
The final location is an area known as the city's Gay Village, where people had been seated at outdoor tables eating and drinking.
A knife was visible to a Reuters witness beside a drain in Edmund Street, near to the second location.
Graham said it was ""way too early"" to say if the knife was connected to the incident.

The captain of the Maersk Etienne chemical tanker had warned last week that, while the migrants had no critical physical problems, the mental strain for those onboard was getting worse. 
""The situation onboard Maersk Etienne escalated further this morning when three migrants jumped overboard,"" a Maersk spokeswoman said on Sunday.
""The captain and crew were quick to implement recovery procedures and the three persons have now been rescued and brought back onboard the ship where they are being given due care,"" she said.

Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai, leader of the Maronite church, has an influential role as religious leader of the biggest Christian community in Lebanon, where political power is divided between its main Christian, Muslim and Druze sects.
Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib, a Sunni Muslim, is in talks to swiftly form a cabinet by mid September, under pressure from French President Emmanuel Macron. Picking ministers in the past has taken months of haggling.
Macron has led international efforts to fix the country of about six million people that has been crushed by debt and which is reeling from a huge Aug. 4 port blast that shattered Beirut, exacerbating Lebanon's deepest crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war.
The patriarch called for an emergency government that was ""small, qualified and strong"" in his Sunday sermon, saying the new cabinet should not return to past ways of ""clientelism, corruption and bias"".
""Fateful times require a government in which there is no monopoly of portfolios, no sharing out of benefits, no dominance by one group, and no landmines that disrupt its work and decisions,"" he said, adding it must ""negotiate responsibly"" with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
His comments were carried by an-Nahar newspaper website and other Lebanese media.

Talks with the IMF were started this year by the outgoing government, but quickly stalled amid a row between ministers, politicians and banks about the scale of losses in the banking system that has been brought to its knees, sending the currency into tailspin and driving many people into poverty.

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - The gruesome killing on Saturday of a second transgender woman in northern Mexico has unnerved the local transgender community and amplified calls for greater protections in the Latin American nation.
The murder of Leslie Rocha in the border city of Ciudad Juarez came days after a transgender civil society group staged a protest there to demand greater protection.
Those demands were sparked by the murder late of Ciudad Juarez-born transgender activist Mireya Rodriguez Lemus, whose body was found earlier this week in Aquiles Serdan, a town in the northern Chihuahua state.
A transgender woman in Ciudad Juarez, who declined to give her name, said people are ""a little scared, a little terrified"" to go out on the streets. 
""We don't know what to do anymore because there are so many hate crimes against the trans population.""
Deborah Alvarez, a transgender activist who spoke to Reuters earlier in the week, described a community beset by worries about its safety.
""You can't imagine what all us trans people have lived through to arrive here, for us still to see that we haven't been defended,"" she said.
Police in Ciudad Juarez did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Last year 117 people from the LGBT+ community were killed in Mexico, up almost a third compared from 2018 and the highest since 2015, according to local advocacy group Letra S.
""They're torturing them, they're killing them horribly,"" said Rocha's aunt, Leticia Sanchez.
""Justice must be had because they deserve respect even if they aren't women - they deserve support,"" she said. ""Why are they doing this?""

The EU needs to encourage democracy and counter Russia's influence in Belarus, Linkevicius said in the interview, adding that the bloc should provide ""concrete help"" to Belarus' opposition.
""Sometimes we react too late and our measures are fragmented and aren't making any impression on society or the people in power,"" Linkevicius said.
""When we will not stand true on our national commitments, it will shatter our own foundation"", he said. ""Belarusian people should not feel deserted.""
Linkevicius said that he would have preferred the EU to wield sanctions, as Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia had done against President Alexander Lukashenko and 29 other Belarusian officials.
Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called on the United Nations on Friday to condemn the crackdown by Lukashenko on protesters who charge he rigged his re-election victory last month.
Tsikhanouskaya also called on the international community to impose sanctions on the individuals responsible for electoral violations. The opposition leader spoke from the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, where she fled after Lukashenko launched his crackdown.

Lukashenko, in power for 26 years, has faced a wave of opposition protests since his Aug. 9 election victory. He has denied accusations by the opposition and Western countries that the vote was rigged and has resisted demands to step down.

(Reuters) - New York Attorney General Letitia James on Saturday moved to form a grand jury to investigate the death of Daniel Prude, a Black man who died after Rochester police officers used a hood and pinned him to the pavement to restrain him.
""The Prude family and the Rochester community have been through great pain and anguish. My office will immediately move to empanel a grand jury as part of our exhaustive investigation into this matter,"" James said in a statement.
Rochester, a city of 200,000 people in the northwest corner of the state, erupted with protests this week after the Prude family released body camera footage from the arrest of Daniel Prude in March. 
The footage showed a group of officers putting a mesh hood over Prude's head - apparently to prevent his spit from possibly transmitting the novel coronavirus - as he kneels naked and restrained on the street.
The video footage also shows officers forcing Prude's face down on the ground. Prude can be heard shouting, ""Take this ... off my face!"" and ""You're trying to kill me!"" in response to the hood. Officers are heard saying ""Calm down"" and ""stop spitting.""
He died a week later at the hospital.
Seven police officers were suspended on Thursday over the arrest. The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide caused by ""complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint"", with intoxication by the drug PCP, a contributing factor.
Rochester officials have faced questions over why the officers were not disciplined until the videotape became public five months later. On Friday, the Rochester police union chief defended the officers, saying they followed their training in responding to Prude, who was having a psychotic episode.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren both issued statements welcoming the grand jury. A spokeswoman for the Rochester Police Department declined to comment.
""I thank Attorney General James for taking this action because it is a trying time in Rochester,"" Warren said.

Protests are expected again on Saturday in Rochester after nearly 1,000 demonstrators marched downtown on Friday night.

About 50 rescue workers and volunteers, including a specialist team from Chile, had worked for three days to locate anyone after sensors on Thursday detected signs of breathing and heat. 
""Technically speaking, there are no signs of life,"" Francisco Lermanta, the head of volunteer rescue group Topos Chile, said in a news conference on Saturday evening, adding that rescuers had combed 95% of the building. 
The signs of life detected in the past two days, Lermanta said, were breaths of fellow rescuers already inside the building picked up by their sensitive equipment. He said efforts would now focus on clearing the rubble and finding remains.
""We never stop with even one percent of hope,"" Lermanta said, of finding a body. ""We never stop until the job is done.""
The Aug. 4 blast killed about 190 people, injured 6,000 more, and devastated whole neighborhoods. The authorities held ceremonies on Friday to mark a month since the explosion tore into a city already reeling from a crippling economic crisis.
Rescue efforts dominated local and social media, as the Lebanese were transfixed, desperate for a miracle. None came. 
The ruined building where the search was continuing lies between the residential districts of Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael, among the hardest hit areas by the blast and home to many old buildings that crumbled as the shockwave ripped through.

(Reuters) - An animals rights group is suing the U.S. government to thwart a Connecticut aquarium's effort to get five new beluga whales, arguing in court that the aquatic animals would be harmed both from the trip from Canada and from being separated from other whales.
The Darien, Connecticut-based group, Friends of Animals, filed its lawsuit Thursday against U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the National Marine Fisheries Service in U.S. District Court to stop a permit for the Mystic Aquarium.
The aquarium in Mystic, Connecticut, already has three beluga whales and it boasts of the largest 750,000-gallon outdoor habitat for whales in the U.S.
Belugas, also known as white whales, are common in the Arctic Ocean's coastal waters and are also found in subarctic waters, according the National Geographic website.
They are classified as endangered in some parts of the world, and ""near threatened"" worldwide.
""Beluga whales do not belong in captivity,"" the lawsuit says. ""They are highly social and intelligent animals who roam large distances in the wild. Captivity robs them on their most basic needs.""
Neither representatives for the aquarium nor the National Marine Fisheries Service were immediately available for comment.
The proposed, 5-year permit cited in the lawsuit, says the aquarium seeks the animals for non-invasive research. The whales would not be allowed to be displayed used for entertainment for the patrons of the aquarium, and the animals could not be bred.
On its website, the aquarium defends the study of belugas in zoological parks and aquariums, saying that it has increased the understanding of factors that threaten the species.

""Mystic Aquarium is a leader in beluga research, care and behaviors,"" it states.

Up to 30 people were detained for taking part in unsanctioned protests, Russian news agency TASS quoted the Minsk police as saying. 
Draped in red-and-white opposition flags, students staged protests in several places in the capital, including outside the Minsk State Linguistic Institute where police had arrested five people on Friday, local media footage showed. 
Elsewhere masked men dragged away students who had gathered at an eatery in Karl Marx Street in the centre of Minsk, while some of the protesters shouted ""tribunal!"", according to footage shown by news outlet TUT.BY.
Thousands of women later held a separate march through Minsk in the afternoon, shouting ""hands off the children"" as one of their slogans. 
One woman went up to masked security forces standing in a line, showing them pictures of protesters with bruises on their bodies. The government has previously denied abusing detainees after many come out of prison following the election complaining of punishment beatings.
Protesters later converged on a Catholic church in Independence Square, with hundreds crammed inside for a service, in solidarity with Minsk's archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz who was barred from re-entering Belarus on Monday.
After the service finished, priests and protesters marched in a procession around the building known as the Red Church and said prayers on the square, with hundreds of people shining their phones as flashlights.
A former Soviet collective farm manager, Lukashenko has struggled to contain a wave of mass protests and strikes since he won a sixth term at an election last month that opponents say was rigged. He denies electoral fraud. 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, his main challenger who fled into exile two days after the election, will travel to Warsaw to meet the Polish prime minister next week. 
A member of her campaign team and a senior member of the opposition Coordination Council, Olga Kovalkova, on Saturday also arrived in the Polish capital fearing she would be arrested again if she remained in Belarus.
Lukashenko has previously dismissed the coronavirus pandemic as a ""psychosis"" that could be tackled by drinking vodka and taking saunas. 
But on Saturday he appeared to chide the protesters for spreading the disease. 
""We stagger through the streets, rubbing against each other,"" he said at a televised government meeting.
""Where's the social distancing and so on in that? We're doing everything we can to delay the moment when we say goodbye to this disease. That's unacceptable."" 
Thousands took part in protests that coincided with the start of the school year on Tuesday. At the Minsk State Linguistic Institute, students sang ""Do you hear the people sing"", a protest anthem from the musical ""Les Miserables"".

The case of wrestler Navid Afkari has caused an outcry from Iranians and human rights groups. U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called on Iran not to execute the 27-year-old Afkari.
Iran's Supreme Court has upheld the two death sentences against Afkari, who was convicted of stabbing to death the guard and other charges, according to state media.
The killing came during some of the worst unrest in the country in a decade after a rise in fuel prices. Iran's clerical rulers have blamed the street protests on ""thugs"" linked to exiles and foreign foes - the United States and Israel.
The television showed what appeared to be written confessions by Afkari, but he has said in a recording circulated on social media that he was coerced to sign the documents.
""I hit twice, once and then again,"" Afkari was shown saying with a stabbing gesture during a police reconstruction of the killing of the middle-aged victim, Hassan Turkman, a water company security guard.
Afkari's attorney said there was no clear evidence proving his client's guilt.
""There is no picture of the moment of the crime. The alleged video is from an hour before the murder,"" Hassan Younesi said on Twitter.
Iran's state media often air purported confessions by suspects in politically charged cases.
The International Federation for Human Rights and London-based Justice for Iran said in a report in June that Iranian state media have aired more than 355 forced confessions in the past decade. Iranian officials reject such accusations.

When he began filming, Grossman had no idea that Thunberg, who was 15 when she started her protest, would quickly become the figurehead for the global climate crisis campaign.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia's upper house ruled on Saturday that plans by the Tigray region to hold an election on Sept. 9 were unconstitutional, setting up a potential clash between the central government and a powerful ethnic party.
The House of Federation, which rules over constitutional disputes, unanimously declared that the polls for regional parliament and other positions were ""unconstitutional and are therefore void"", the body said in a statement.
Getachew Reda, a spokesman for the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) which runs the northern province, told Reuters in a text message on Friday that the vote would go ahead despite pressure from the central government. 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has liberalised the politics and economy of what was once one of the most tightly controlled countries in Africa since taking power in 2018.
But those reforms have also led to ethnic tension and occasional outbreaks of violence, as politicians in the provinces have asserted their authority against that of the central government.
The TPLF, one of the founding groups in a coalition of ethnic parties that has run the country since the 1990s, stayed out of a new unified ruling party formed under Abiy.
In March, Ethiopia postponed parliamentary and regional elections that had been scheduled for August, citing the coronavirus pandemic. A new date still has to be set. 
The International Crisis Group think tank said last month that the Tigray administration and the central government were on a ""collision course"". Abiy's government would ""consider any new regional administration illegitimate"" if the election went ahead, the group said.

Calderon ruled Mexico from 2006-2012. He has been trying to convert the Freedom and Democratic Responsibility group that he runs with his wife, Margarita Zavala, into a political party to contest the 2021 mid-term congressional elections.
INE's general council rejected the party in a seven-to-four vote, saying late on Friday that its decision was due to Free Mexico ""having more than 5% of contributions from unidentified people.""
The decision can still be challenged before Mexico's Electoral Tribunal, however.
INE President Lorenzo Cordova said the institute had questions about the origin of 8.2% of the group's financing, which is why he voted against it.
Calderon's supporters called the decision a blow to democracy and Calderon, a vocal critic of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, vowed to continue the political battle.
""They are not going to stop us,"" he tweeted after the decision. His wife, meanwhile, said they would ""immediately challenge this absurd resolution.""
The 2021 mid-term lower house elections are due to be held in the middle of next year and will decide whether Lopez Obrador's leftist Morena party will keep control of Congress.

INE's decision comes as Mexican activists have begun gathering signatures for a referendum on charging former presidents with graft, heeding calls by Lopez Obrador, who says he would respect the outcome of a public vote on the issue.

""This instils cautious but reasonable optimism,"" Alberto Zangrillo said in a brief statement.
Berlusconi, 83, tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday and was taken to Milan's San Raffaele hospital the following day after developing a slight fever. A subsequent x-ray revealed that he had developed mild pneumonia in both lungs.
Zangrillo, who stirred controversy in May when he said coronavirus was losing its potency, told reporters he had decided to hospitalise Berlusconi as a precautionary measure given his age and previous health problems. 
The media tycoon underwent major heart surgery in 2016 and has also survived prostrate cancer.

Though mainly focused on a provincial political crisis in the Khabarovsk region more than 6000 km (3700 miles) east of Moscow, demonstrations have also seen support for suspected poison victim Alexei Navalny and opposition protests in Belarus. 
Residents of Khabarovsk started holding weekly rallies after the July 9 detention of Sergei Furgal, the region's popular governor, over murder charges he denies. His supporters say the detention is politically motivated.
The Khabarovsk demonstrations are one of the longest sustained expressions of discontent with the Kremlin, outside of Moscow, during President Vladimir Putin's 21 years in power.
One protester on Sunday carried a placard accusing Putin of ""coming to Furgal with handcuffs, to Navalny with poison"". Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner, is being treated in Germany for what medics there say was poisoning with a nerve agent in Russia. Moscow says it has seen no evidence he was poisoned.

Some of the protesters in Khabarovsk carried the red and white flag that protesters in Belarus are using to signal their opposition to Moscow-backed leader Alexander Lukashenko.

Veran however ruled out the need for a new nationwide lockdown, telling BFM television that France had other means to fight the virus, including testing.
""I cannot envision a general lockdown. The lockdown was a lid on an overflowing cooking pot,"" he said.
Health authorities on Friday reported 8,975 new confirmed cases, almost 1,500 higher than the previous daily peak of 7,578 on March 31, when France was in one of Europe's strictest coronavirus lockdowns.
The death toll in France stood at 30,686 people as of Friday.
As the rise in infections has mainly affected young people, who are less likely to develop complications, there has so far been less strain on French hospitals, which were almost overwhelmed at the end of March.
But after falling steadily for months after an April 14 peak of 32,292, the number of people hospitalised was up by 28 on Friday to 4,671, rising for a sixth day in a row.
""We are not all on the same epidemic wave as last spring. We are on a slower trend but one that must alert us,"" Veran said.
""This week, 55 patients on average were hospitalised in intensive care units (ICU) each day, this means we are on an average of 1,500-2,000 people hospitalised in ICU units per month in our country. This is not neutral and we must be extremely vigilant,"" he added.
Current hospitalisation numbers reflected infections contracted two weeks ago, Veran said. 

""So it is obvious that in the next 15 days there will be an increase, it will not be massive but there will nevertheless be an increase in the number of severe cases and in the number of people hospitalised and in ICU units""

Hundreds of representatives from the junta, political parties and civil society groups attended the start of talks in the capital Bamako which are meant to chart a path forward after the Aug. 18 coup that ousted President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. 
The military takeover was welcomed by many Malians, tired of violence by Islamist and ethnic militias and alleged high-level corruption. But the junta, the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP), is under intense pressure from West African neighbours to swiftly return power to civilians. 
Less than an hour after the opening ceremony began, supporters of the M5-RFP coalition, which led mass demonstrations against Keita before the coup, began to protest, accusing the junta of excluding them from most working groups. 
M5-RFP supporters in the conference hall shouted down the moderator onstage, bringing proceedings to a halt. 
""This smells rotten,"" said Moussa Ouattara, an M5-RFP supporter. ""The CNSP is in all the groups but the M5-RFP is only in one group."" 
The moderator later announced that the M5-RFP would be able to participate in all the working groups, which calmed the coalition's supporters and allowed the event to resume. 
The M5-RFP voiced enthusiastic support for the coup but sharply criticised the junta last week after it wasn't invited to preliminary consultations about the transition.
The talks, which are also being held in regional capitals across Mali, are scheduled to continue on Sunday and then resume again late next week. 

International powers fear the political uncertainty in Bamako could undermine the fight across West Africa's Sahel region against Islamist militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State, as a previous coup in 2012 did.

The Japan Meteorological Agency has urged residents of Okinawa and Kyushu to exercise maximum caution as Typhoon Haishen was on course to approach Okinawa by Sunday and the main southern island of Kyushu afterwards. 
""People in affected areas should not hesitate to evacuate their homes, even though they may be worried about being infected with the coronavirus,"" a meteorological official told a news conference broadcast by NHK on Saturday. 
The typhoon is forecast to have atmospheric pressure of 915 hectopascals at its centre, and sustained winds of up to 198 km (123 miles) per hour on Sunday, the meteorological agency said. 
The typhoon's centre was near Minamidaito, east of Okinawa's main island, on Saturday, moving north at 30 kph (19 mph). 
To prevent damage from the typhoon, Kyushu Railway Co said it will suspend some of its train operations on Sunday and all operations on Monday. 
Water was discharged at 23 dams in six prefectures to prevent damage from floods caused by the typhoon, Kyodo news agency reported. 
Bad weather from the typhoon has forced Japan's coastguard to suspend its search for crew missing from a capsized cattle ship in the East China Sea.
Typhoon Haishen follows Typhoon Maysak, which smashed into the Korean peninsula on Thursday, leaving at least two dead and thousands temporarily without power.

Alain Cocq, 57, who has been suffering from a degenerative disease for 34 years, has said he would livestream his death on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) from Saturday morning.
""So I have finished my last meal ... I drink to your health one last time. The road to deliverance begins and, believe me, I am happy,"" Cocq said in a video posted on Friday night and shot from his medicalised bed at his home in Dijon, eastern France.
""I have made up my mind and I am at peace,"" he added.
He had written to Emmanuel Macron asking to be given a sedative to allow him to die in peace but the president wrote back to him explaining this was not allowed under French law.
France's neighbours Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands have adopted laws that allow medically-assisted dying in some cases. But France has resisted that step, in part under pressure from the Catholic Church.
""Because I am not above the law, I am not able to comply with your request,"" Macron said in a letter to Cocq, which the Frenchman published on his Facebook page.
""Your wish is to request active assistance in dying which is not currently permitted in our country,"" said Macron.
The Claeys-Leonetti law on the end of life, adopted in 2016, authorizes deep sedation but only for people whose prognosis is threatened in the short term.
Cocq has called for a change to French law to allow medically-assisted dying in cases such as his.
He was fed by a drip and his digestive system connected to a colostomy bag. His condition has caused brain aneurysms, and he experiences convulsions if he does not take his medicine. He has said he experiences constant pain.
Macron added a handwritten postscript to his letter, saying: ""With all my personal support and profound respect.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Hundreds of high school students demonstrated in Bangkok on Saturday to demand reform of an education system they say is outdated in the latest of more than a month of anti-authority protests.
Protests that began on Thai university campuses have taken place almost daily since mid-July in an increasing challenge to the government in the Southeast Asian country with some protesters also demanding change to the powerful monarchy.
Over 600 students rallied outside the education ministry in Bangkok. They called for the freedom to be able to speak their minds at school and the relaxation of rigid rules on uniforms and behaviour.
""Thai education has made us puppets,"" 18-year-old Supicha ""Menu"" Chailom said. ""We are not robots of the system, we are the youth and have the right to express ourselves."" 
Protests spread to some high schools last month, with students raising the ""Hunger Games"" three-finger salute during morning assemblies, a symbol of the pro-democracy movement.
Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan told reporters that he respected students' rights. 
""The issues that the youth raised are things we can come to an understanding on as long as we respect each other and the rules,"" he said. 
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the main target of the protests, last week warned protesters they were creating divisions that could cause the collapse of Thailand and leave it ""engulfed in flames"".
He has particularly condemned those who have demanded reforms to the monarchy - once a taboo subject.

On Saturday, Thailand’s government released a cartoon drawn by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who spends most of his time in Europe, that portrayed a happy Thai family living a contended rural life.

The group said late on Friday that nearly 80 people had blocked roads leading to two printworks, at Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, north east of London, and at Knowsley, near Liverpool.
Hertfordshire police said they had made 42 arrests, while Merseyside police said they had made 21.
The Murdoch-owned Newsprinters works also print the Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph and the Financial Times. 
Extinction Rebellion said it took the action to highlight what it regards as the newspapers' failure to accurately report on climate change.
The protests, which continued through to Saturday, were condemned by interior minister Priti Patel.
""This morning people across the country will be prevented from reading their newspaper because of the actions of Extinction Rebellion,"" she said on Twitter.
""This attack on our free press, society and democracy is completely unacceptable.""
A Newsprinters spokeswoman said the disruption meant printing had to be transferred to other sites.
""We apologise sincerely to any readers of The Sun, The Times, the Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph and the Financial Times who may be unable to buy their usual newspaper this morning due to late deliveries,"" she said.
""This attack on all of the free press impacted many workers going about their jobs. Overnight print workers, delivery drivers, wholesale workers and retail newsagents have faced delays and financial penalty. This is a matter for the Police and the Home Office.""
The blockade is part of a week of protests by Extinction Rebellion, including on Wednesday in Parliament Square where demonstrators lay under white sheets to represent corpses.
The group says an emergency response and mass move away from polluting industries and behaviours is needed to avert a looming climate cataclysm.
It said it plans further protests in central London on Saturday.

Both sides deployed additional forces along the frontier running through the western Himalayas after a clash in June, during which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in hand-to-hand fighting. China has not released casualty figures for its troops.
In the highest level face-to-face political contact between India and China since tensions first flared along the border in May, defense ministers Rajnath Singh of India and General Wei Fenghe of China met late on Friday on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting in Moscow.

The explosion, which fire service officials suspect was caused by leakage from the pipeline, occurred on Friday night at a mosque in Narayanganj district, just outside the capital Dhaka. 
Dozens were rushed to Dhaka's state-run specialized burn and plastic-surgery hospital, most of them with severe burns.
Thirteen people, including a child, died after they sustained burn injuries, said Samanta Lal Sen, coordinator of the burn unit. The death toll could rise further as many of them were in critical conditions, he said.
Fire officials said gas that accumulated in the mosque after pipeline leaks likely triggered the blasts.
""We primarily suspect that gas leaked from the pipeline and accumulated inside the mosque since the windows were shut. When the air conditioners was turned on, due to sparks the gas could have exploded,"" said Abdullah Al Arefin, a senior fire service official.
All six air conditioners in the mosque exploded during the incident, he said.

But the United States “is far more heartless and evil than those things,"" he added. 
Instead, it ""imposed new sanctions and pressures on us over these past seven months of coronavirus,"" Rouhani said.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Protesters against a COVID-19 lockdown defied police in Australia's hotspot on Saturday, prompting 15 arrests, even as the state of Victoria continued its gradual improvement in stemming new cases due to the nearly five weeks of restrictions.
Around 200 protesters in the state capital Melbourne rallied with chants of ""freedom"" and ""human rights matter"", surrounded by swarms of police. 
One of the arrests was for assaulting police, while others were arrested or fined for breaching health restrictions, Victoria police said in a statement.
""It is not safe, it is not smart, it is not lawful. In fact, it is absolutely selfish for people to be out there protesting,"" state Premier Daniel Andrews told a news conference.
Victoria reported 76 new COVID-19 infections and 11 deaths on Saturday. Andrews is due to outline plans on Sunday for easing Melbourne's stage 4 restrictions, which shut large parts of the economy, required everyone to stay home except for essential business and imposed a nighttime curfew.
There were two rallies in Sydney and one in Byron Bay in the state of New South Wales, which also breached local restrictions against large gatherings.
Outside Victoria, Australia reported five new coronavirus infections in New South Wales, one in Queensland and one in South Australia.
Over the past two months, infections in the country have more than tripled to 26,207, with Victoria making up around 75% of the total. Australia's deaths from COVID-19 have surged over that period to 748 from 104, with Victoria making up 90%.
""These stark figures show us the serious impact of the second wave of COVID-19 in Victoria,"" Australia's deputy chief medical officer, Michael Kidd, told reporters.
Victoria's new cases were below 100 most days this week, down from a peak of 725 new infections on Aug. 5, but remain higher than health officials had hoped five weeks into a six-week hard lockdown. 
""The tail of the second wave is a stubborn thing,"" Andrews said.
Australia's government and businesses have urged Victoria, which makes up about a quarter of the nation's economy, to lift the restrictions as the country has sunk into its first recession since 1991.
Andrews said he would take a ""steady and safe"" approach out of the lockdown.
""This is a health problem in the first instance and until you fix the health problem, there can be no economic repair,"" he said.
In neighbouring New Zealand, a former prime minister of the Cook Islands, Joseph Williams (NYSE:WMB), died of COVID-19. His was the second coronavirus-related death in the country in two days, following an outbreak in the country's largest city, Auckland, taking the country's total to 24 deaths.

The fire broke out in the engine room of the New Diamond on Thursday morning, and it has spread to the bridge of the ship, which was carrying about 2 million barrels of oil. [L4N2G110B] 
A rescue and salvage effort that also involved the Indian and Russian navies brought the fire under control on Friday, before it could reach the vessel's cargo area. 
Navy Spokesman Captain Indika de Silva told Reuters the ship is being held some 40 km (25 miles) east of Sri Lanka, while firefighting boats spray it with water. 
""The fire is under control but not out yet,"" de Silva said.
""We are keeping the ship in a location that is far enough from the shore in case there is an oil leak, so that our shoreline does not get damaged.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's ruling party is calling for the punishment of officials whose failure to follow orders resulted in ""dozens of casualties"" during typhoons that lashed the Korean peninsula this week, a state newspaper reported on Saturday. 
The isolated country has been grappling with torrential rains, floods and typhoons in one of the wettest rainy seasons on record.
Rodong Sinmun, an official party newspaper, reported that officials in Wonsan, an eastern coastal city hit especially hard by Typhoon Maysak, and surrounding Kangwon Province did not implement instructions to secure buildings at risk and prepare for a potential evacuation of residents. 
""Dozens of casualties have occurred ... because of red tape and tricks among the city and provincial officials who did not accept the party's guidelines,"" the newspaper said.
The party held a meeting to review the officials' wrongdoings and seek strict legal punishment, the newspaper added. 
On Wednesday, state television aired rare live reports of storm surge and torrential rains including from Wonsan, showing a damaged bridge, a flooded square and buildings and a van carrying loudspeakers to broadcast safety warnings.
The Rodong Sinmun separately reported activities to recover destroyed farms in the central county of Unpa, the country's breadbasket, while soldiers were seen repairing homes, bridges and river banks nationwide. 
Concerns are growing about further crop damage and food supplies as the impoverished North braces for another, potentially more powerful typhoon, Haishen, which is on track to batter the peninsula's east coast starting Monday. 
38 North, a U.S. think tank specialised in North Korea, said commercial satellite imagery showed more than 100 military and fishing vessels docked at the eastern port of Sinpo on Friday, much more than the usual 30-40, ahead of the typhoon. 
But the shipyard, a major submarine base where submarine-launched ballistic missiles have been tested, appears to have suffered little damage from the recent storms, the think tank said.

The Paraguayan government said on Wednesday a confrontation in the country's north with members of the Paraguayan People's Army (EPP) had left two ""rebels"" dead. 
The EPP, said to have been trained by Colombian rebels and active in marijuana-growing regions, has been accused of kidnappings and attacks in Paraguay over the past ten years. 
On Friday, Paraguay said those killed had been two teenage women, without giving their age or nationality. 
The Argentine foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday evening after receiving a request from Paraguay that it consulted the country's national registry and established that the deceased were both eleven years old and Argentine citizens. 
Federico Gonzalez, an advisor to the Paraguayan presidency, told reporters that Paraguay's forensic report suggested the deceased were Paraguayan and older. 
""The information we have is that these people were born in Paraguay and later transferred to Argentina, where they obtained these (identity) documents,"" said Gonzalez.
He denounced the girls' parents for ""sending their children into battle with the security forces."" 
Argentina's foreign ministry said it was in touch with authorities in Paraguay, a landlocked nation with a population of around 7 million, to clarify the circumstances of the deaths. 
Gonzales said the EPP camp raided by the security forces had been occupied by some 14 people now being sought in the surrounding area, known as Yby Yau, about 370 km (230 miles) north of capital Asuncion. 
The Paraguayan security operation brought criticism of rightist President Mario Abdo's government from opposition lawmakers and human rights organizations. 
""Instead of offering forensic data and documentary evidence, the government of Mario Abdo rushed to bury the bodies of these girls before they had even been identified,"" the country's main opposition parties said in a statement. 
Paraguay's Human Rights Coordinator said the operation ""bears all the hallmarks of a fresh state crime.""

The British daily reported that EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is said to be insisting that London must agree not to implement any change to UK legislation that could distort trade with the bloc without first consulting Brussels.
Barnier's UK counterpart, David Frost, has rejected the approach, The Times reported.
EU diplomats said earlier that Barnier went to London on Tuesday to tell Frost Britain must move on state aid, or there will not be a Brexit agreement.
The chances of Britain leaving the European Union without a trade deal have risen sharply as negotiations have been threatened by London's insistence that it have full autonomy over its state aid plans.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Rescue workers dug through the rubble of a Beirut building for a second day on Friday hoping to find someone alive more than a month after huge port explosion shattered Lebanon's capital.
By evening, rescue workers, including a team from Chile, had yet to locate anyone after sensors had on Thursday detected signs of a pulse and breathing. But they said they would continue while there was a small chance anyone had survived.
""We are still working in very bad conditions. The building is at risk of collapse. But we are still working,"" George Abou Moussa, director of operations in the civil defence, told Reuters, adding the operation would continue into the night.
The Aug. 4 blast killed about 190 people and injured 6,000. The authorities held ceremonies on Friday to mark a month since the explosion tore into a city already reeling from a crippling economic crisis. 
Francisco Lermanda, a member of the Chilean team, told reporters that search and rescue teams were working to determine whether or not anyone was still alive but would not announce details ""out of respect for the family, out of respect for the people"".
The ruined building where the search was continuing lies between the residential districts of Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael, among the hardest hit areas by the blast and home to many old buildings that crumbled as the shockwave ripped through.
During the day, mechanical diggers lifted chunks of concrete and masonry as workers used shovels and their hands to dig. A crane helped lift steel girders and other heavy debris.
Residents gathered nearby, hoping someone could be found, while some said the government had not done enough to help.
""The government has been completely complacent, has been completely absent,"" said Stephanie Bou Chedid, a volunteer from a group helping victims of the blast.
President Michel Aoun followed up on the operation in a phone call with the civil defence head, the presidency said.
Mohamed Houry, 65, said he hoped someone was alive but, even if only bodies were uncovered, ""it's important their families can find peace"".
Rescuers used scanning equipment to create 3D images of the wrecked building, which once housed a bar on its ground floor, to try to locate anyone alive, television showed.

1230,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 11:02PM ET</span>","Russia presses Germany for more detail on Navalny, urges 'transparency'","MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Friday that it wanted dialogue with Germany over the case of opposition politician Alexei Navalny and that Russian doctors who treated him initially were much more transparent than the German doctors treating him now. 
Germany, where Navalny is in hospital, has said he was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent and wants the perpetrators held to account. Russia has until now not opened a criminal investigation and said there is no evidence yet of a crime.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow wanted to find out from Germany what exact substance caused Navalny to fall ill in Siberia last month.
""According to the version of our doctors it wasn't a poisoning,"" Peskov said. ""The German specialists managed to establish some kind of poisonous substance. We're counting on a dialogue with our German colleagues.""
He added: ""Investigative actions are being carried out by our specialists, and if there is confirmation of the presence of poisonous substances in the biological material of the patient (Navalny), then of course legal consequences will follow. We ask everyone to rely on the facts.""
Navalny is the most popular and prominent opponent of President Vladimir Putin, and the German announcement this week that he was poisoned by a nerve agent has raised the possibility of further Western sanctions against Moscow.
Separately, a Russian court said on Friday it had rejected a complaint filed by allies of Navalny accusing a top law enforcement body of inaction over what they said was his attempted murder. 
One of Navalny's allies accused the Investigative Committee, which handles probes into major crimes, of inaction following a statement they filed to it on Aug. 20 demanding a criminal investigation be opened into Navalny's attempted murder. 
The court said the Investigative Committee had passed on the statement by Navalny's supporters to one of its regional branches in Siberia and asked for it to be reviewed. 
Kira Yarmysh, Navalny's spokeswoman, said the court had said their statement had been treated as a ""citizen's appeal"", a legal nuance she said meant it could take up to 30 days for it be looked at. 

""Anything so they don't have to start an investigation,"" she wrote on Twitter.

The arrests took place in the building of Minsk State Linguistic Institute, which had warned students several days ago that it would call in the police unless they halted their protests against last month's disputed re-election of President Alexander Lukashenko.
Social media footage showed several dozen students belting out a chorus of ""Do you hear the people sing"", a rousing protest anthem from the musical ""Les Miserables"", standing behind the white and red flag that is the emblem of the opposition.
Other clips showed students remonstrating with the police as those arrested were pulled away, and pleading with a university official to respond to the incident.
An interior ministry spokeswoman said the arrests were part of an ""administrative process"" and were not connected with events on Friday, presumably a reference to the singing.
The five students were released from police custody later on Friday after being charged with taking part in illegal protests, according to social media posts and Belarusian media outlets. 
Thousands of students took part in protests across the country on Sept. 1, the first day of the academic year, as part of a wave of opposition to Lukashenko's Aug. 9 election victory, which his critics say was rigged.
Separately, a court in Minsk jailed six journalists who were detained at the Sept. 1 student protest for three days each, the Belarusian Association of Journalists said. They were found guilty of taking part in illegal protests. 
The protests and strikes have confronted Lukashenko with the gravest threat yet to his 26-year-old grip on power in the former Soviet republic.
Broadcaster Euroradio showed video of students confronting university officials after the arrests with chants of ""Shame!""

Dozens of people gathered outside the university in a show of solidarity with the students.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called on the United Nations on Friday to condemn the crackdown by President Alexander Lukashenko on protesters who charge he rigged his re-election victory last month.
Speaking to a virtual informal session of the U.N. Security Council, Tsikhanouskaya also urged the United Nations to send an international monitoring mission to Belarus and said the U.N. Human Rights Commission should hold a special session on the human rights situation there. 
Tsikhanouskaya also called on the international community to impose sanctions on the individuals responsible for electoral violations ""and crimes against humanity.""
""We, the Belarusian people, need the help of the United Nations, in order to stop blatant human rights violations and cynical disregard for human dignity,"" Tsikhanouskaya said, making her first call for international involvement in the crisis.
""We ask the United Nations to condemn the use of excessive force by the Belarusian security services against protesters.""
The opposition leader spoke from the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, where she fled after Lukashenko launched his crackdown.
Lukashenko, in power for 26 years, has faced a wave of opposition protests since his Aug. 9 election victory. He has denied accusations by the opposition and Western countries that the vote was rigged and has resisted demands to step down.
Human rights experts from the United Nations said this week they had received reports of hundreds of cases of torture, beatings and mistreatment of Belarusian protesters by police.
The government has denied abusing detainees and has said its security forces have acted appropriately against demonstrators.
SANCTIONS
""We urge the United Nations to send the needed international authority mission to Belarus to document the situation on the ground,"" said Tsikhanouskaya, adding that the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Belarus must be allowed free access to and movement in the country.
Tsikhanouskaya, a political novice, emerged as the consensus opposition candidate in last month's election after better-known figures, including her jailed activist husband, were barred from standing.
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia imposed travel bans on Lukashenko and 29 other Belarusian officials last month, signaling impatience with the West’s cautious approach by announcing sanctions without waiting for the rest of the European Union.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday the United States and European partners were together reviewing imposing targeted sanctions on anyone involved in human rights abuses in Belarus.
A senior U.S. State Department officials told Reuters this week Washington was considering imposing sanctions on seven Belarusians it believes were involved in falsifying the election results and in violence against peaceful protesters.
The EU is still negotiating the exact list of people to be hit with travel bans and asset freezes when its foreign ministers meet on Sept. 21, diplomatic sources said.
Belarus is a close ally of Moscow, which sees it as a vital strategic buffer between Russia and NATO.

Lukashenko has accused foreign powers of being behind the protests, but has provided no evidence. The opposition has denied that there is foreign involvement in the protests and NATO has also denied his allegations that it is massing forces near the Belarusian border.

Two of the people, Indira Alfonso and Jose Gutierrez, were appointed earlier this year by the pro-government Supreme Court to oversee the national electoral council, which has called elections for this December.
The Venezuelan opposition and the United States say the council is stacked with Maduro loyalists and cannot oversee a fair vote. The main opposition coalition, led by parliament head Juan Guaido, has vowed to boycott the election.
""The corrupt Maduro regime is attempting to seize control of the National Assembly of Venezuela through a fraudulent election,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
Also sanctioned were Reinaldo Munoz, Maduro's solicitor general, and former Venezuelan state Governor David de Lima, who the Treasury said had orchestrated vote-buying operations to sway opposition lawmakers.
Venezuela's foreign ministry responded in a statement that the move is an effort to interfere in the upcoming election. 

""It has become clear that the sacred value of democracy is not more than empty rhetoric on the part of a government that boasts of being democracy's biggest defender,"" the ministry said.

1234,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 11:01PM ET</span>",EU's Michel says relocation no silver bullet to migration feuds,"By Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe must improve migration procedures on its external borders, seal more deals with foreign countries and synchronise asylum policies in the bloc before it tackles the thorny issue of hosting asylum seekers, a top EU official said on Friday.
European Council President Charles Michel, who chairs summits of EU leaders, spoke to Reuters and five other European news agencies as the bloc prepares to have a fresh go at reforming its troubled asylum laws.
The system all but collapsed amidst a surge in arrivals of those fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa with more than a million people reaching the EU in 2015. This fuelled support for eurosceptic and nationalist groups, as well as contributing to Brexit. 
""It's not easy, it's a difficult question and a difficult topic,"" Michel said. ""Let's start with some initiatives which will help us be more efficient and maybe decrease political sensitivity of some other topics.""
By the latter, he meant deep rifts among the 27 EU countries over how to care for refugees and migrants.
Under the EU's now-defunct rules, the southern states of arrival like Italy, Malta or Greece are responsible but they were quickly overwhelmed at the height of the sea arrivals season.
Countries opposed to immigration, such as Poland and Hungary, as well as Austria, however, refuse to help by hosting some of those people.
Years of such disputes damaged the EU's cohesion, as well as leading it to tighten its external borders and asylum policies. 
""POISONOUS""
That has cut the numbers crossing the Mediterranean on unsafe dinghies but also drawn fire from rights groups over drownings and ""Fortress Europe"" denying help to those in need.
The bloc's executive now wants overhaul of EU asylum law. 
Sources told Reuters the proposal would still include obligatory relocation of asylum seekers among all member states at times of major immigration spikes, the element previously vehemently rejected by several states. 
While the Commission's proposal is expected at the end of September at the earliest, Michel said member states should first work more on external borders and clinching deals with foreign capitals under which the EU offers money and assistance in exchange for them hosting migrants and refugees rather than letting them embark for Europe.
Michel also proposed convergence of asylum benefits across the EU, where rich countries like Germany and Sweden are the most desired destinations, which contributes to uneven distribution of people across the bloc. 
""Mandatory relocation is not the alpha and omega of the migration discussion. These threee points are more important,"" he said. 
Germany, which now holds the EU's rotating presidency, hopes to get before the end of the year a ""political road map"" for a future deal to end rows over migration at a time when the EU faces challenges in its ties with Russia, China, Turkey and the United States. 

Stressing how tall an order that would be, a senior EU diplomat told Reuters: ""We are very far away from any sort of consensus. For different political reasons, the matter is still completely poisonous.""

The court in June replaced First Justice's leaders with former members of the party who had been expelled on accusations they were in cahoots with Maduro, a ruling the party cited as one of the reasons for boycotting the Dec. 6 vote.
But First Justice on Friday responded that it planned to boycott the election even though the supreme court had rolled back the prior ruling. 
""First Justice reiterates its decision not to participate in the illegitimate electoral process called for December 6, 2020, for lack of electoral conditions and the risks associated with COVID-19,"" the party wrote on its Twitter account.
The supreme court's website shows only a one-sentence summary of the ruling, with no other details.
First Justice is part of the coalition that supports opposition leader Juan Guaido, who is recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela's legitimate president and who is leading an opposition effort to boycott the legislative election. 
Henrique Capriles, a two-time presidential candidate and long-time First Justice member, has been in talks with the government to seek better conditions for the elections - putting him at increasing odds with the party.
First Justice said on Friday that those ""running as candidates will be making the decision to leave the party,"" without directly addressing Capriles' situation.
Maduro's government banned Capriles in 2018 from running for office on the basis of alleged financial irregularities when he was governor of the state of Miranda.
On Wednesday, Capriles said the opposition cannot hand the legislature to Maduro.
Losing congress would complicate Guaido's claim to the presidency, which is based on his status as the chief of congress. The opposition had a landslide win in 2015 and the term ends in January.

Trump told reporters the situation was ""very nasty,"" adding that the two countries were ""going at it much more strongly than a lot of people even understand.""
Both sides deployed additional forces along the frontier after a clash in June, during which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in hand-to-hand fighting.
The defence ministers of India and China held talks in Moscow on Friday, the highest level face-to-face political contact since tensions flared along the disputed mountain border in May.
In the meeting, Chinese defense minister Wei Fenghe told his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh that New Delhi bears full responsibility for the current border tensions, according to China's state-backed Global Times newspaper.
India's defence ministry tweeted that the meeting lasted for 2 hours and 20 minutes, without giving out further details.
A U.S. government source told Reuters in Washington the U.S. assessment is that neither China nor India are interested in pushing the dispute to the point that they would engage in war.
Trump, asked about the dispute at a news briefing in the White House, said Washington was talking with both countries about what it could do to help defuse the situation.
""We stand ready to help with respect to China and India. If we can do anything, we would love to get involved and help,"" he said. 

Trump has offered to mediate between the two nuclear-armed nations in the past. China has said that there is no need for a third party to mediate and India has also appeared cool to the idea.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Satellite imagery of a North Korean shipyard on Friday shows activity suggestive of preparations for a test of a medium-range submarine-launched ballistic missile, a U.S. think tank reported on Friday.
The Center for Strategic and International Studies said the images it published on its website of North Korea's Sinpo shipyard showed several vessels within a secure boat basin, one of which resembled vessels previously used to tow a submersible test stand barge out to sea.
It said the activity was ""suggestive, but not conclusive, of preparations for an upcoming test of a Pukguksong-3 submarine launched ballistic missile from the submersible test stand barge."" 
North Korea said last October it had successfully test-fired a Pukguksong-3, a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), from the sea as part of efforts to contain external threats and bolster self-defense.
That launch was seen by analysts as the most provocative by North Korea since it entered dialogue with the United States over its nuclear weapons and missile programs in 2018. 
North Korea has suspended long-range missile and nuclear tests since 2017, but efforts led by U.S. President Donald Trump to persuade it to give up its nuclear and missile programs have achieved little.
Trump is seeking reelection in November and a North Korean missile test before that would highlight the lack of progress despite Trump's unprecedented meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
There was no immediate comment from the State Department or the Pentagon on the CSIS report.
At news conference earlier on Friday, Trump hailed his relationship with North Korea, saying that when he was elected people had predicted he would be at war with the country within a week.
""In the meantime, we've gotten along with them. We didn't get to war,"" he said.
Trump has held up the absence of intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear tests by North Korea since 2017 as a success from his diplomacy and has sought to play down numerous shorter-range tests in the period.
""North Korea already tested a PKS-3 SLBM last October. And it didn’t cross Trump’s redline then, and is unlikely to this time. Trump won't care,"" Vipin Narang, a non-proliferation expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote on Twitter.
South Korea's military said the Pukguksong-3 tested last year flew 450 km (280 miles) and reached an altitude of 910 km (565 miles) and would have had a range of about 1,300 km (800 miles) on a standard trajectory.
News of the activity at Sinpo comes amid signs that North Korea may be preparing for a major military parade in October, which some analysts believe could be used to show off new missiles as the country has done at such events in the past.

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 10:59PM ET</span>","Rochester, NY police union says officers acted by book in using hood in man's arrest","By Nathan Layne
(Reuters) - The head of Rochester, New York's police union on Friday defended the actions of officers involved in the March arrest of Daniel Prude, a Black man whose death triggered protests, saying they followed protocols in using a hood to restrain him.
""They had to do exactly what they did,"" Rochester Police Locust Club President Michael Mazzeo told a news conference on Friday, adding that there was a ""substantial amount of evidence to show why the protocols"" used by the officers were employed.
Prude, a 41-year-old Black man, died after an encounter with police in Rochester, New York, in March. His family this week released body camera footage from his arrest, showing a group of officers putting a mesh hood over Prude's head - apparently to prevent his spit from possibly transmitting the novel coronavirus - as he kneels naked and restrained on the street.
Release of the video was followed by protests in Rochester, turning the city of 200,000 people in the northwest corner of the state into the latest flash point in a summer of civil unrest over racism and police brutality.
Seven police officers were suspended Thursday over the arrest. The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide caused by ""complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint"", with intoxication by phencyclidine, or the drug PCP, among additional contributing factors.
Rochester police chief La'Ron Singletary and mayor Lovely Warren, both Black, have faced questions over why the officers were not disciplined until the videotape became public five months later. Singletary has said internal and criminal investigations were underway. 
Mazzeo, in his first comments since the body camera footage was made public, said he had been told by Singletary's office after the arrest that there were ""no concerns"" with the officers and that they had followed training. 
Maria Haberfeld, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that based on the known facts and the video evidence available online she believes the officers acted properly, including in their use of a so-called ""spit hood"".
""This device is intended to protect officers and others from somebody who threatens to bite or spit, or uses their mouth to infect them,"" Haberfeld said, describing their response to the situation as ""absolutely by the book"". 
The video footage also shows officers forcing Prude's face down on the ground. Prude can be heard shouting, ""Take this ... off my face!"" and ""You're trying to kill me!"" in response to the hood. Officers are heard saying ""Calm down"" and ""stop spitting.""
Prude's head was then pressed onto the pavement for two minutes, according to video footage and records released by Prude's family. He died a week later at the hospital.

Pressing a person's face down is also a common procedure among police departments as a way to gain control over someone who is resisting arrest or who appears to be under the influence of drugs, Haberfeld said.

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 10:57PM ET</span>",How Jerry Falwell Jr. mixed his personal finances with his university's,"By Aram Roston and Joshua Schneyer
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After parting ways with President Jerry Falwell Jr in the wake of personal scandals, Liberty University has hired a firm to investigate “all facets” of Falwell’s tenure, including the school’s financial and real estate operations. 
There may be much to untangle. 
Falwell, who took over as president of Liberty in 2007 after years as a lawyer handling its real estate interests, intertwined his personal finances with those of the evangelical Christian university founded by his father.
He put his two sons - and their wives as well - on the university’s payroll. He arranged the transfer of a multi-acre Liberty facility to his personal trainer. He enlisted a friend’s construction company to manage an ambitious campus expansion costing hundreds of millions of dollars.
And before becoming school president, Falwell set up two companies that enabled him to cut property deals with one of the many nonprofit entities affiliated with the university, Reuters found. In each of the deals, Falwell played multiple roles with potentially conflicting interests: He was an officer of the university, a board member for the nonprofit selling the land, and a private developer who could profit from the transactions.
“It’s very worrisome to have these sorts of financial arrangements going on and they deserve intense scrutiny,” said Michael Bastedo of the University of Michigan School of Education.
In 2001, property records show, Falwell set up a private company while he was a lawyer for Liberty, used it to buy an undeveloped tract of land from the school, and then developed a strip mall on the plot. The company sold the property five years later at a significant premium.
In 2005, property records show, Falwell again acted as a private businessman when a university nonprofit affiliate and a company he operated joined together to sell land to a third company - controlled by Falwell’s real estate partner. 
And in 2012, in a project Falwell launched as Liberty’s president, the university spent more than $2 million to build a tunnel that links the campus to another shopping plaza near campus. Falwell is a part owner of that shopping plaza.
Falwell told Reuters that each of these transactions benefited Liberty University. None was inappropriate in any way, he said.
He stepped down last week after Reuters reported that a business associate alleged a years-long affair with Falwell and Falwell’s wife, Becki. The associate, Giancarlo Granda, says the relationship involved him having sex with Becki Falwell while Jerry Falwell looked on. Becki Falwell declined to comment; Jerry Falwell has denied involvement in the relationship, which he says was between his wife and Granda only.
Falwell’s departure marked a dramatic fall for one of the most powerful figures in America’s evangelical Christian movement. In 2016, Falwell’s endorsement of Donald Trump was widely credited as helping propel Trump to the U.S. presidency.
Falwell said in interviews that Liberty will pay him $10.5 million as part of a severance and retirement package. Liberty declined to comment on the terms or the amount. 
Liberty’s board of trustees subsequently announced it was hiring “one of the leading forensic firms in the world to conduct a thorough investigation” that will examine the school’s operations under Falwell, including financial and real estate matters. It declined to name the firm.
The outside investigation may not examine the 2001 and 2005 deals that Falwell handled while he was a Liberty lawyer, however. Asked about those transactions, a Liberty spokesman said: “At this time, the forensic investigation is limited to Jerry Falwell’s term as president.”
After initially referring questions to his legal and public relations representatives, Falwell called Reuters late Wednesday afternoon and said he looked forward to the Liberty investigation. “I welcome it because it will prove that all you guys are liars,” he said, referring to members of the media. “You got nothing.”
He also warned Reuters not to question his two adult sons, both of whom still have jobs at Liberty. “Trust me,” Falwell said during the call, “you do not want to mess with me, OK?”
Liberty employed a private firm - JF Management - formed by Jerry “Trey” Falwell III, Falwell’s elder son, to manage university properties. The company received more than $58,000 in compensation in 2017, according to the school’s most recent public filing of tax form 990 with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Trey Falwell also serves as a Liberty vice president, with total compensation from the university of $189,000 a year, according to the tax filings. 
Falwell’s other son, Wesley, drew compensation in 2017 from Liberty of $54,744, the filings show. Laura Falwell, Wesley’s wife, earned $57,751 that year from Liberty, and Sarah Falwell, Trey’s wife, earned $63,315. 
None of the Falwell children or their spouses could be reached for comment. In a statement released by Falwell’s lawyer, Falwell said: “Trey, Wesley, and their spouses get paid fair value for their work and have performed that work very well.”
A school spokesman told Reuters that examining the Falwell family’s dealings with Liberty is “within the scope of the forensic investigation.” 
Company insiders - in this case, Jerry Falwell - aren’t legally barred from conducting personal business transactions with the nonprofits they run, such as those identified by Reuters. But some governance specialists say such deals can raise concern about conflicts of interest or potential breaches of fiduciary duty. Nonprofit entities, such as Liberty and most other universities, are meant to serve charitable, educational or religious interests. Under tax laws, their proceeds cannot be used for the private benefit of individuals. 
Eric Chafee, a law professor at the University of Toledo in Ohio, said Falwell’s real estate deals predating his presidency are worthy of further scrutiny. “These sweetheart land transactions are certainly eyebrow-raising,” he said. 
The tax-exempt Liberty relies on hundreds of millions of dollars in Pell grants and government-backed student loans. Liberty students received $618 million in federal taxpayer loans and aid in a single year, according to a 2018 audit report. 
QUESTIONABLE CONDUCT
The allegations of a sexual affair were the latest in a string of personal disclosures about Falwell. Weeks earlier, he had posted a photo of himself on Instagram with his pants unzipped and his belly exposed, his arm around a pregnant woman. Falwell said it was meant as a joke; even so, he took an indefinite leave of absence from Liberty not long after.
A Liberty spokesman said “no determination has been made” about whether the investigation will examine the personal conduct of either Jerry or Becki Falwell. But the spokesman said the school “will investigate any allegations that fall within its Title IX policies prohibiting sexual discrimination and sexual harassment and its Human Resource policies addressing sexual misconduct, as well.”
Initially, the examination appears to be focused more on business dealings, however. 
As Liberty University president, Falwell oversaw a dramatic growth in the school’s revenues, due in part to the popularity of its distance learning programs. In 2018, its assets topped $2.8 billion. 
He also presided over a $1 billion construction spree at its Lynchburg, Virginia, campus, adding new buildings that included a library, dorms and a gleaming sports arena that was scheduled to open this year. 
Central to the campus construction boom has been a long-time Falwell friend, Robert Moon. In 2013, Moon formed a company called Construction Management Associates, or CMA - with the help of a $750,000 start-up loan from Liberty. CMA was then tapped to manage huge portions of the campus building spree. The university’s most recent public 990 filing shows CMA received more than $64 million in revenue from Liberty during 2017. 
Moon’s business has also been a “substantial contributor” to the university, making gifts to Liberty, the 990 filings show. 
Asked last year about CMA’s growing business with Liberty, Moon told Reuters that “using a trusted construction manager as the owner’s agent is a method being employed at lots of campuses to complete major projects.” He said that CMA had helped save Liberty “millions,” that the company had repaid its Liberty loan with interest, and that CMA’s revenues are largely “passed through the trade contractors for their labor, materials, equipment and supplies.”
A Liberty spokesman said the construction activities and contracts in which Falwell was involved, including the role of CMA, is “within the scope of the forensic investigation.” 
EARLY DEALS
A Reuters examination of land records revealed that companies personally founded by Falwell cut property deals with one of the many nonprofits affiliated with the university as early as 2001. Falwell orchestrated those deals even as he was a Liberty official and a trustee for the nonprofit from which his companies bought the land, the Liberty Broadcasting Network.
The television network, LBN for short, carried sermons of Falwell’s father, the Rev. Jerry Falwell. It also promoted Liberty University, operated from the school’s campus, and offered Christian family-oriented programming. But LBN, a university affiliate, wasn’t particularly successful and required loans from Liberty to stay afloat. 
LBN owned properties in the area, and Jerry Falwell Jr was a trustee for those holdings. When LBN began to sell its assets, at least two of the properties ended up in deals involving Falwell, Reuters found. 
One was a 1.4 acre vacant lot just across the highway from Liberty’s campus, at 3920 Wards Road. In April 2001, LBN sold the lot for $327,000 to a newly founded limited liability company. The purchaser, Gateway Country Plaza LLC, operated from a Liberty University building, corporate registration records show, but Gateway didn’t belong to the school. Rather, it was a for-profit real estate holding firm and was partially owned by Falwell himself. Falwell signed as “member/manager” on its financial documents.
Once the Falwell-led firm owned the property, it erected a building there at an estimated cost of $153,000, according to a city permit. By 2002, the vacant lot had become a strip mall. 
After the shopping strip was developed - with further investment by Falwell’s company - the property value soared. By 2006, Falwell sold the property for $2.7 million, more than eight-fold what his company had paid for the undeveloped tract five years earlier.
In statements to Reuters last year, Falwell defended the deal, arguing that LBN lacked the money or expertise to develop the land itself. He said his company “paid fair market for this property” and invested $1.7 million to build the mall. He did not provide documentation for this figure.
In 2005, Falwell engineered another deal involving Liberty-owned land and a separate private entity he controlled, called Eastern Heights LLC, according to records filed in Lynchburg City Court. Eastern held land next to a parcel owned by LBN. Railroad tracks separate the land from Liberty’s campus. 
Eastern and LBN together sold the parcels for $1 million. Falwell signed the deed of sale on behalf of Eastern, property records show.
The buyer: Swift Creek Capitol, a company controlled by Chris Doyle, a friend and business partner of Falwell. Doyle has brokered or co-invested with Falwell in several private property ventures. 
Falwell was involved in various sides of the Swift Creek transaction. He wrote up the deed itself, as “Jerry L Falwell Jr, Attorney-at-Law.” He signed the deed he created, listing himself as Manager of Eastern Heights LLC. He was an owner of Eastern Heights, the for-profit co-seller. And he also was in private business with Doyle, the buyer. In addition to investing in property with Falwell, Doyle has also worked as a real estate broker for Liberty University, where Falwell oversaw the property holdings. 
In a statement to Reuters, Doyle said he is honored to have worked with the Falwells. “My business dealings and personal relationships are private matters,” he said.
In another matter that linked Liberty business with Falwell’s own, the university spent millions on a project that connected the campus to a nearby shopping plaza.
In January 2012, school president Falwell announced that a new pedestrian tunnel, paid for by Liberty, would let students and staff leave the campus from another exit. The tunnel cost the school around $2.2 million, a Liberty official told the local newspaper - a figure confirmed by a person familiar with the project. The tunnel runs beneath railroad tracks that made it perilous to cross from campus to the stores. 
Falwell and his business partner Doyle owned part of the shopping plaza near where the tunnel exits. 
In a statement to Reuters last year, Falwell said the tunnel helps ensure the safety of students who otherwise had to cross railroad tracks to get to the shopping area. It was “the only workable” location for the tunnel, Falwell said. 
Moreover, he said, the pedestrian tunnel did not help the shopping plaza but hurt it. The reason, Falwell explained: Students would sometimes park at the mall and clutter the area.
A Liberty spokesman told Reuters that the university knew about Falwell’s ownership interest before the tunnel project was launched. The school has said the tunnel offers “easy and safe access to restaurants and stores along the busiest corridor in the City of Lynchburg.”
Chafee, the professor at the University of Toledo, said that, given the nature of Falwell’s presidency at Liberty, the school’s investigation should examine deals like these. 

“There was so much control and domination by Falwell in regard to the transactions that were undertaken,” Chafee said.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 10:57PM ET</span>","Defying critics, U.S. security chief pushes Trump's law-and-order message","By Ted Hesson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - At the heart of President Donald Trump’s law-and-order election campaign is Chad Wolf, who as acting secretary of homeland security has defied critics by championing Trump's message in stark terms, sending U.S. federal forces into some cities and expanding the boundaries of his Cabinet post.
Little known outside Washington until now, Wolf has become one of Trump's most visible aides. Echoing the Republican president, he paints a dark picture of Portland, Oregon, a city controlled by rival Democrats, as overrun by looters during summer protests against racism and police brutality.
In dozens of appearances on the conservative Fox News Channel, Wolf, 44, has defended Trump, called for police forces to rein in “violent anarchists” and dismissed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as “delusional” for saying Trump’s re-election in November would foster more violence.
Wolf caused an uproar with his deployment of federal agents to quell unrest in Portland because of their unmarked uniforms and use of unmarked cars to pull protesters off the streets.
In Wolf's defense Alexei Woltornist, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), wrote in a statement to Reuters that DHS law enforcement officers were under attack and local leadership in Oregon had refused to step in. 
""(Acting Secretary) Wolf would have been derelict in his duties to not speak out and take action,"" he wrote.
Wolf's emergence as Trump's law-and-order messenger surprised some current and former DHS colleagues who said they viewed Wolf as a non-ideological moderate before Trump named him acting secretary in November 2019, the fifth person to head the department during Trump's tumultuous tenure. 
Trump's previous homeland security chiefs implemented his agenda, especially on immigration, but they did not always embrace his heated language or promote it as regularly in conservative media. Trump last week said he would seek to install Wolf permanently in the role. 
But Democrats accuse Wolf of politicizing a department which oversees election security and which could play a pivotal role in the Nov. 3 election when Trump, trailing Biden in opinion polls, hopes to secure a second four-year term.
SWIFT PIVOT
Protests have swept the United States since late May when George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Sporadic violence and looting accompanied some of the protests.
Buoyed by Wolf's actions, Trump has sought to portray himself as tough on crime and the only person who can halt a descent into anarchy. Wolf has deployed agents from his department to Portland, Seattle and Washington, D.C., where some local Democratic leaders have said they are not welcome.
Despite Trump's focus on violence, only 8% of Americans view crime as a major problem confronting the country and 53% remain sympathetic to anti-racism protests, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday. 
Wolf previously served as head of the DHS office of strategy, policy and plans. Before that, he was chief of staff to former secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who resigned in 2019 amid tensions with Trump over border security.
    Having worked as a lobbyist before joining the Trump administration, Wolf never before led a large organization and lacked the stature and experience of some previous DHS secretaries.
    ""My perception from working with him was that he was a technocrat, he was a subject matter expert,"" said David Lapan, a DHS spokesman at the start of the Trump administration who worked closely with Wolf. 
    ""I didn’t see him as an ideologue,"" said Lapan, now vice president of communications with the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center. ""But I certainly see him that way today.""
    Wolf did not inject politics into staff meetings during his time running the DHS policy office, according to one current official who requested anonymity to discuss the matter.
    ""My impression of him had been more part of the 'adults in the room' camp, though in a sort of junior way,"" the official said. ""I've been surprised by his whole Portland thing.""
    
    PORTLAND TURNING POINT
    Wolf kept a relatively low public profile during his first few months running the department, even as DHS took a lead role in responding to the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
    He found his moment as racial justice protests heated up around the country. 
Wolf sent DHS personnel to Portland in July as part of a Trump-ordered effort to protect monuments and federal buildings from ""violent mobs.""
Videos posted online showed camouflage-clad officers without clear identification badges using force and unmarked vehicles to transport arrested protesters, which riled Democrats and led to calls for DHS to withdraw.
    Last weekend Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, a Democrat, blamed Trump for violence in the city following the death of a protester affiliated with the far-right group Patriot Prayer.
    Wolf then sent a sharply worded letter to Wheeler that accused him of inaction and allowing ""senseless violence and destruction night after night.""
Wheeler called that ""grandstanding"" in a statement to Reuters on Thursday.
    A senior DHS official close to Wolf said that his stark language was not ideologically driven. 
    ""It goes back to just doing the job,"" the official said. ""It’s not like he sought the limelight here, it just so happened that violent rioters and anarchists wanted to attack the cities.""   
    Democrat Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, has opposed many of Wolf's actions and urged him to step down.
    ""Of all the secretaries that I’ve interfaced with - and I’ve been on the committee since its inception - he’s by far the most partisan, least truthful and most resistant to oversight,"" Thompson said in an interview.
    Thompson said Wolf had ignored a tradition of bipartisanship at the department, transforming it into ""the Donald Trump re-election committee."" 
Woltornist, the DHS spokesman, called the criticism ""sad.""
In an email, Biden campaign spokesman Mike Gwin accused Trump and Wolf of inflaming tensions and trying to turn federal law enforcement into a tool for Trump's political gain.
    Mick McKeown, a Washington-based consultant and former Trump DHS official, praised Wolf's performance as acting secretary, saying he had learned to work with Trump, unlike his predecessors.

""He had a first-row seat to everyone else’s failures and he was able to learn from that.""

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 05:31PM ET</span>",Top U.S. prosecutor says 'agitator removed' after police kill Portland shooting suspect,"By Deborah Bloom and Andrew Hay
PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - Police shot and killed a self-declared anti-fascist activist in Washington state on Thursday night as they moved in to arrest him on suspicion he fatally shot a right-wing counterprotester last weekend in Portland, Oregon, officials said.
Michael Reinoehl, 48, wanted on a murder charge, was armed with a handgun when members of a U.S. Marshals Service fugitive task force shot him dead in Olympia, Washington, after he left an apartment building and got in a car around 7:30 p.m., according to the Marshals Service and the Thurston County Sheriff's Office.
""During the attempt to apprehend him, shots were fired at the suspect in the vehicle and he fled from the vehicle on foot. Additional shots were fired at the suspect and he was later pronounced deceased at the location,"" the Thurston County Sheriff's Office, which is responsible for investigating the incident, said in a statement.
A Multnomah County, Oregon court had charged Reinhoel with the murder of Aaron Danielson, and Portland police issued a warrant for his arrest, asking U.S. marshals to locate him.
""It sounded like fireworks, it was that many shots,"" bystander Jashon Spencer said in an online video. 
Reinoehl, who had provided security for Black Lives Matter protests in Portland, in a video interview with Vice aired hours before his death appeared to admit he shot Danielson on Saturday night.
Danielson, 39, was part of a caravan of supporters of Republican President Donald Trump who rode in pickup trucks into downtown Portland and clashed with protesters demonstrating against racial injustice and police brutality.
This marks the first case in which the Justice Department has directly linked a demonstrator in Portland to a far-left political movement.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Oregon confirmed that none of the defendants from those protests facing federal charges had been linked to any particular group or political ideology.
""The tracking down of Reinoehl - a dangerous fugitive, admitted Antifa member, and suspected murderer - is a significant accomplishment in the ongoing effort to restore law and order to Portland and other cities,"" U.S. Attorney General William Barr said in a statement. ""The streets of our cities are safer with this violent agitator removed."" 
Nationally, Antifa is a largely unstructured, far-left movement whose followers broadly aim to confront those they view as authoritarian or racist.
Danielson, a Portland man who ran a specialty moving company in the city for over 20 years, was a supporter of right-wing Christian conservative group Patriot Prayer.
 Facebook Inc  (O:FB) on Friday said it took down the pages of Patriot Prayer and group founder Joey Gibson, whose supporters have clashed with anti-fascists in Portland every weekend since mid-August.
""They were removed as part of our ongoing efforts to remove Violent Social Militias from our platform,"" Facebook said in a statement.
Portland has seen escalating confrontations between right- and left-wing groups after nearly 100 days of protests since George Floyd, a Black man, died in Minneapolis on May 25 after a white police officer knelt on his neck.
'NO CHOICE'
Reinoehl told freelance journalist Donovan Farley he acted in self-defense.
""I had no choice. I mean, I, I had a choice. I could have sat there and watched them kill a friend of mine of color. But I wasn't going to do that,"" he said in the video Farley provided to Vice News, adding he feared he would be stabbed.
Bystander video showed two men approaching Danielson and a friend, one saying ""Hey, we got one over here, we got a couple over here,"" and another ""Pull it out,"" before two shots were fired.
“I was confident that I did not hit anyone innocent. And I made my exit,” Reinhoel said in the Vice interview.
He was previously cited for carrying a loaded gun at a July 5 Portland protest, resisting arrest and interfering with police, according to The Oregonian newspaper. The charges were subsequently dropped, the newspaper reported. 
In social media posts Reinoehl, a father of two, described himself as a professional snowboarder, an Army veteran and ""100% ANTIFA."" 
He said he was prepared to fight to change the ""course of humanity.""

""It will be a war and like all wars there will be casualties,"" he said in a June 16 Instagram post.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - El Salvador's attorney general on Friday said he plans to investigate allegations that the government of President Nayib Bukele is negotiating with members of a notorious gang to reduce homicides.
When the number of homicides in the poor Central American country started to drop, international observers suggested it might be down to ""quiet, informal understandings between the gangs and the government"".
""Of course we are going to investigate,"" Raul Melara told local television after local newspaper El Faro published documents alleging dealings with a gang. ""No one should take advantage of the institutions to negotiate with terrorists.""
Official prison documents that were not previously made public detail how the government of Bukele has been negotiating with the leaders of the powerful Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang, the paper said. 
The gang would reduce violence in exchange for better prison conditions, El Faro said. The two sides have also discussed MS-13 support for the government in legislative elections next year, the paper said. 
Reuters could not independently verify the contents of the documents. The presidency did not respond to a request for comment.
Osiris Luna, El Salvador's director of prisons who El Faro documents allege is involved in the negotiations, said the allegations were not true and termed them ""political maneuvering"".
Murder rates have dropped significantly under Bukele's government, which assumed power in June 2019. Homicides have dropped 56% between January and September this year, compared with the same period in 2019.
Bukele has in the past attributed the drop to an increased police and military presence on streets and tighter security in gang-controlled jails.
So far, several current and former officials of parties across the spectrum have been investigated and prosecuted for past alleged agreements with gangs in exchange for benefits and electoral support.

The import-dependent country has been plunged into crisis and scarcity by tough U.S. sanctions and the COVID-19 outbreak.
The arrival was seen as a hopeful sign for tens of thousands of laid-off leisure industry employees, shuttered small businesses and hard-pressed residents in general. 
An Air Canada plane arrived at midday at the Cayo-Coco airport on the northcentral coast. Air Canada Vacations, the airline's tour business, said it would now fly weekly to Cuba and biweekly beginning next month.
Cuba closed its airports in March due to the pandemic. While some hotels are open under international sanitary regulations at resorts in isolated areas such as Cayo-Coco, there is no indication when Havana and other cities might allow foreign visitors to return.
Cuba has managed to control the pandemic in most of the country. But it is currently trying to contain a new outbreak in Havana, along with lesser outbreaks in a few other provinces.
The country has reported nearly 4,300 COVID-19 cases to date and 100 deaths.
Canada has long been Cuba’s most important tourist provider, accounting for 1.1 million of the 4.2 million arrivals in 2019, according to the government.
Industry revenues were $2.6 billion last year.
The United States bans residents from making tourist trips to Cuba as part of its decades-old trade embargo, but U.S. citizens can still travel to the Caribbean island for purposes including education.

Messi, who made a shock announcement that he wanted to leave his lifelong club last month, said he would see out his contract until 2021 in order to avoid taking Barca to court.
""If he can stay for one more year and we can make the most of him and go see him play at the stadium, for me it's very positive,"" said FC Barcelona fan Oriol Vives, 31.
Jorge Sos, 39, added: ""I think it's good news for Barcelona because he is the best player in the world.""
Yet some fans felt the saga had soured Messi's relationship with the club.
""I think it's good he isn't leaving but with all the mess he has created, to be honest, it is not good for Barcelona because he doesn't give the impression he wants to play for the team,"" said Sergi Roda, 24.

""The management of the club led by (president Josep Maria) Bartomeu is a disaster,"" he was quoted as saying on Goal.com.
It was a sentiment echoed by some Barca fans on Friday.
""The whole situation has been very unpleasant,"" said Jordi Marti, 43. ""I think that the majority of the fault is the management's.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday strongly denied a magazine report saying he had called fallen U.S. military personnel buried in Europe ""losers"" and declined to visit an American cemetery during a trip to France because he thought it unimportant.
The Atlantic magazine reported that Trump, a Republican running for re-election who has touted his record helping U.S. veterans, had referred to Marines buried in an American cemetery near Paris as ""losers"" and declined to visit in 2018 because of concern the rain that day would mess up his hair.
Trump on Thursday told reporters the story was false.
""To think that I would make statements negative to our military and fallen heroes when nobody has done what I've done,"" for the U.S. armed forces, Trump said. ""It's a total lie. ... It's a disgrace.""
The president said he did not go to the cemetery because weather prevented a helicopter flight. The alternative, a long drive, would have meant going through very busy areas of Paris, and the Secret Service objected, he said.
""The Secret Service told me, 'You can't do it.' I said, 'I have to do it. I want to be there.' They said, 'You can't do it,'"" Trump said.
The Atlantic said in an emailed statement: ""We stand behind our reporting.""
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is leading Trump in national polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election, emphasized his own commitment to helping members of the military in a response to the report.
""If the revelations in today’s Atlantic article are true, then they are yet another marker of how deeply President Trump and I disagree about the role of the President of the United States,"" Biden said in a statement released by his campaign. 
""And if I have the honor of serving as the next commander in chief, I will ensure that our American heroes know that I will have their back and honor their sacrifice — always.""
As a presidential candidate, Trump made negative comments about now-deceased Republican Senator John McCain for having been captured during the Vietnam War.
“He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured,"" Trump said in 2015 when he was running for the Republican presidential nomination. 
Trump said on Thursday he disagreed with McCain but still respected him.

The situation came to light after the publication of a blog post attributed to professor Jessica Krug, in which the white author confesses to falsely claiming Black Caribbean heritage. 
""For the better part of my adult life, every move I've made, every relationship I've formed, has been rooted in the napalm toxic soil of lies,"" the blog post read. ""I have built my life on a violent anti-Black lie, and I have lied in every breath I have taken.""
The post continued with Krug writing that she ""eschewed my lived experience as a white Jewish child in suburban Kansas City under various assumed identities within a Blackness that I had no right to claim.""
Krug did not immediately respond to emailed and phoned requests for confirmation that she wrote the blog post. 
George Washington University spokesperson Crystal Nosal said in a written statement that ""We are aware of the post and are looking into the situation."" 
The Washington, D.C. university would provide no more comment and did not explicitly confirm that Krug wrote the blog post. 
The case is similar to that of Rachel Dolezal, a Washington state NAACP civil rights leader, who identified as Black but was biologically white. 
Krug authored a 2018 book titled ""Fugitive Modernities"" that examined the political practices of those who fled slavery. The book was a finalist for the 2019 Frederick Douglass Book Prize and also the Harriet Tubman Prize.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Police in Congo's capital Kinshasa fired tear gas on Friday to disperse around 100 protesters calling for the expulsion of the Rwandan ambassador they accuse of denying a massacre during the 1998-2003 Congo war.
Two people were seriously injured, one of whom was in critical condition, after inhaling tear gas and being beaten by police, said Carbone Beni from the campaign group Filimbi, which organised the protest.
Kinshasa's police chief Sylvano Kasongo confirmed some protesters were hurt, but said injuries were not serious. The city's governor had not authorised the demonstration, he said.
The protest was broken up before the group reached the Rwandan embassy.
In August, Ambassador Vincent Karega responded to a Twitter post that accused Rwandan troops of killing more than a thousand people in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo in August 1998.
""Blatant incoherence between image and history... accusation without evidence is called slander,"" Karega tweeted and later deleted.
Karega told Reuters on Friday his comments had been misinterpreted and he did not deny that a massacre had taken place. He said he was thankful for the level of organisation shown during Friday's protest.
Millions died of conflict, hunger and disease during the war in eastern Congo. Rwanda was one of several neighbours that intervened, and many Congolese blame their smaller neighbour for provoking the conflict.
Relations between Rwanda and Congo have been turbulent for decades, although ties have improved in recent years.

""Decapitation is the punishment of blasphemers,"" read one of the placards carried by protesters. 
The cartoons sending up the Prophet Mohammad triggered outrage and unrest among Muslims around the world in 2005 when they first published by Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten.
Earlier this week, Charlie Hebdo - a satirical weekly - revived the cartoons to mark the start of the trial of suspected accomplices in an Islamist militant attack on its Paris office in January 2015.
The Islamist gunmen who stormed into Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people, sought to avenge the Prophet Mohammad, a French court heard on Wednesday on the first day of the trial. Publication of the cartoons was cited as the reason for the attack.
Friday's protests were organized by the hardline Islamist Tehreek-e-Laibak Pakistan (TLP) party with rallies held in Karachi, the country's largest city, as well as in Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Lahore and Dera Ismail Khan.
Protesters paralysed traffic in Karachi, Pakistan's financial and business capital.
“It (re-printing of cartoons) amounts to big terrorism; they repeat such acts of blasphemy against Prophet Mohammad every few years. It should be stopped,” said Razi Hussani, TLP district leader in Karachi.
Similar rallies held in Pakistan in 2015 turned violent, with scores injured as police clashed with protesters trying to make their way to the French consulate in Karachi. 
Pakistan's government also condemned the reprinting of the cartoons. Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said the South Asian country believed in freedom of expression but such liberty does not mean a license to offend religious sentiment. 
Charlie Hebdo has long tested the limits of what society will accept in the name of free speech. 
“We will never lie down. We will never give up,” Charlie Hebdo editor Riss Sourisseau wrote in explaining the decision to re-publish the cartoons.

""Kosovo will be the first country with a Muslim majority to open an embassy in Jerusalem,"" Netanyahu said. ""As I've said in recent days - the circle of peace and recognition of Israel is expanding and more countries are expected to join.""
Only two countries - the United States and Guatemala - have already opened embassies in Jerusalem. Palestinians have opposed such moves.
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to forging a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, who with broad international backing want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as their capital.
Israel regards all of the city, including the eastern sector it annexed after the 1967 war, as its capital.

Israel and the United Arab Emirates last month agreed to normalize diplomatic ties in an accord Trump helped broker.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Libyan families filed a civil lawsuit in a U.S. federal court late on Thursday accusing Khalifa Haftar, commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), of war crimes, human rights abuses and torture during a 2016-2017 offensive to seize a key Libyan district, a court filing showed.
The complaint, the third filed in a U.S. court against the military commander, is linked to 2016-2017 siege of the Libyan district of Ganfouda, which had been encircled for months as Haftar waged a years-long military campaign to drive Islamist-led opponents from eastern city of Benghazi.
The fate of civilians trapped in Ganfouda had been a major point of contention, with the United Nations and international human rights groups calling for them to be granted safe passage amid allegations of human rights abuses by both sides.
The criminal complaint, filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, seeks compensatory damages from Haftar, who is a U.S. citizen and previously lived in Virginia, according to media reports. Lawyers for the Libyan families also wrote a letter to Attorney General William Barr, calling him to launch criminal proceedings against Haftar.
""Mr. Haftar and his forces, which are being supported by countries such as Russia, have been accused of horrific war crimes and crimes against humanity by respected international organizations across the world,"" the families' lawyer said in the letter.
In the complaint, plaintiffs detailed how Haftar's forces, during their assault on Ganfouda in 2016-2017, repeatedly struck their block by shelling and air strikes, preventing their safe evacuation.
Duncan Levin of New York law firm Tucker Levin PLLC, who represents Haftar and his sons, had no comment on Friday.

Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Since 2014, it has been split into rival camps. An internationally recognized government and allied armed factions control the northwest, while Haftar’s LNA holds sway over the east.
Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the internationally recognized government is backed by Turkey.
President Donald Trump's April 2019 phone call to Haftar raised questions about where Washington stood on Libya. Months later, the United States began to openly oppose Haftar's Tripoli offensive, express its discontent against Russian involvement and called on all external forces to stand down.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Serbia and Kosovo have agreed to normalize economic ties, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday, hailing what he called a ""major breakthrough"" more than a decade after Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008.
Trump, speaking in the Oval Office with the leaders of both countries, said Serbia had also committed to moving its embassy to Jerusalem, and Kosovo and Israel had agreed to normalize ties and establish diplomatic relations.
Serbian President Aleksander Vucic told reporters there were still many differences between Serbia and the breakaway province, but said Friday's agreement marked a huge step forward.
Kosovo Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti said the agreement should lead to mutual recognition between the two countries.
""Serbia and Kosovo have each committed to economic normalization,"" Trump said. ""By focusing on job creation and economic growth, the two countries were able to reach a major breakthrough.""
The announcement came after two days of high-level talks among the leaders and senior Trump aides, and follows close on the heels of last month's historic agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates to normalize ties.
Ethnic Albanian-majority Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 after a NATO-led bombing campaign to curtail ethnic warfare. Serbia, backed by its large Slavic and Orthodox Christian ally Russia, does not recognise Kosovo's independence, a precondition for Belgrade's future membership in the European Union.
National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, who participated in the meetings, said the agreement on expanding economic ties could pave the way for political solutions in the future.
A top EU official on Monday said EU-led negotiations, which broke down in 2018 but resumed in July, could lead to a deal within months.

The U.S. talks were previously set for June but delayed after Kosovo President Hashim Thaci was indicted for alleged war crimes during the 1998-99 guerrilla uprising against Serbian rule and its aftermath. He has denied the charges.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders will decide on a ""carrot and stick"" approach to Turkey when they meet on Sept. 24-25, their chairman said on Friday, proposing a multi-party conference to defuse tensions in the eastern Mediterranean. 
European Council President Charles Michel spoke to Reuters and five other European news agencies as a stand-off over oil and gas deposits simmered between EU members Cyprus and Greece on one side and the bloc's uneasy NATO ally Turkey on the other. 
The EU has already imposed minor sanctions against Ankara over the matter and the 27 EU leaders will tackle it again soon in Brussels. Michel, who will host the meeting, said the EU would reaffirm its support for Greek and Cypriot sovereignty.
""We will identify tools in our external policy, a sticks and carrots approach - what tools to use to improve the relationship and what tools to react (with) if we are not being respected,"" he said. ""We want to be respected.""
Michel, who is due to travel to Greece, Cyprus and Malta before the summit, also proposed an international conference on the eastern Mediterranean involving the key parties and NATO.
""That could be the best way to de-escalate in the region and offer a channel for dialogue,"" he said, adding he had already floated the idea with Athens and Ankara. ""What is happening, what has been happening the last few weeks, cannot go on.""
Michel said the gathering could discuss the thorny issue of maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean, energy, security and migration. Last month Turkey sent a survey vessel, escorted by frigates, to explore for oil and gas in waters claimed by Greece, a move Athens said was illegal.
A collision between Greek and Turkish warships shadowing the survey vessel last month highlighted the risk of conflict.
INCENTIVES AND DISINCENTIVES
Michel declined to discuss the specific incentives or punitive steps the bloc could take with respect to Turkey. 
Ankara has long sought an upgrade of its customs union with the EU, a process that has stalled over President Tayyip Erdogan's sweeping anti-terrorism legislation that underpinned widespread jailings of opponents following an abortive 2016 military coup. Turkey's long-standing request to join the EU is all but dead over Erdogan's perceived authoritarianism. 
At the same time, the bloc relies on Turkey to prevent millions of Syrian and other refugees and migrants on its soil from heading to the EU, where migration feuds have spurred the rise of eurosceptic nationalist parties in recent years. 
The EU has already promised 6 billion euros to help Turkey host migrants, though Ankara has long complained the money was too slow to arrive. The bloc could agree more such funding in one example of a positive gesture to Turkey. 
Granting Turkey's wish for visa-free travel to the bloc, however, has long been contentious among EU member states that also object to Erdogan's track record on human rights and the broad, post-coup crackdown on dissent. 
Asked about potential EU sanctions before Michel's comments, a spokesman for Erdogan's AK Party said the bloc could expect cooperation from Turkey if it were hit with penalties over the eastern Mediterranean.

""At that point, the EU should not expect cooperation on the migrant issue. It should not think that it can impose sanctions over the eastern Mediterranean and continue cooperation in other areas,"" Omer Celik told broadcaster NTV. He added that Ankara would ""be happy"" to join any potential negotiating round.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union countries are considering a new climate target for 2040, to give the bloc an emissions-cutting goal for each decade between now and 2050, when it hopes to reach ""net zero"" emissions, under proposals seen by Reuters.
The EU is aiming to strike a deal this year on a law to make its climate targets legally binding, and member states will start discussions next week on the text.
A proposal by Germany, which will lead the talks between countries, would fix a new EU emissions reduction target for 2040 to keep countries on track for the bloc's flagship goal to become climate neutral by 2050.
""Where it is necessary for the achievement of the climate neutrality objective... a Union-wide climate target for 2040 shall be set,"" the document said.
Currently, the EU has emissions reduction goals for 2020, 2030 and 2050. 
The climate law will need approval from EU member states and the European Parliament. While the 2040 target is unlikely to be a point of contention, lawmakers and countries are split over how strict other parts of the law should be.
The German proposal would enforce the EU's 2050 net zero emissions target at an EU-wide level. 
Members of the parliament, who will attempt to agree their position on the law next week, want a binding commitment for every member state to decarbonize by 2050. 
This is opposed by eastern countries who say the goal is unrealistic, but supported by campaigners who say it is aligned with the emissions pathway scientists say would avoid the most severe impacts of climate change.

""This should be a no brainer,"" Greenpeace climate policy adviser Sebastian Mang said, of setting national 2050 climate neutrality goals.

The International Atomic Energy Agency inspected one of the sites and took environmental samples there, one of the two reports obtained by Reuters said, referring to samples aimed at detecting traces of nuclear material that may have been present.
The agency's inspectors will visit the other site ""later in September 2020 on a date already agreed with Iran, to take environmental samples"", the report said. 
The other report said that Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium (LEU) rose by 534 kg in the most recent quarter, roughly the same amount as in the previous three months, to 2,105.4 kg.
That is more than 10 times the 202.8 kg limit set by Iran's 2015 nuclear accord with big powers, which Iran has been breaching in response to Washington's withdrawal from the deal in 2018 and reimposition of sanctions against Tehran. 
The stockpile, however, remains far below the many tonnes of enriched uranium Iran had accumulated before the 2015 deal.
Tehran is enriching up to a fissile purity of 4.5%, which while above the deal's 3.67% limit is still far short of the 20% level it achieved before the deal. Roughly 90% purity is considered weapons-grade, suitable for an atomic bomb.
Iran agreed on Aug. 26, during the first visit to Tehran by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi, to allow access for U.N. inspectors to two sites suspected of once hosting covert uranium conversion and nuclear testing activities.
While the IAEA says it has the right to examine such sites without permission, Iran objected because at least some of the information about them came from a trove of documents on its past activities that Tehran's main Middle East adversary, Israel, says it seized inside Iran.

Rights lawyer Anon Nampa, 36, and student activist Panupong “Mike” Jadnok, 24, were sent to the Bangkok Remand Prison on Thursday after the court said political activities since their Aug. 8 release breached their bail conditions.
Around 100 protesters gathered at the prison.
“We are tying white ribbons to demand justice for our friends who face political prosecution,” said Patsaravalee Tanakitvibulpon, leader of the Free People Movement.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - After seizing power to widespread acclaim last month, Mali's junta has faced a reality check ahead of weekend talks about a transition back to civilian rule, stung by sharp criticism from some political leaders and teachers' unions. 
Cheering crowds poured into the streets to welcome the Aug. 18 coup that toppled President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, who was criticized for failing to address militia violence, alleged high-level corruption and a faltering economy. 
The junta, the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP), now faces pressure to show it can do better - a challenge made more difficult by economic sanctions imposed by West African neighbors after the coup.
The first sign the honeymoon might be over came last weekend when the coalition that led protests against Keita before the coup - and enthusiastically welcomed the military's intervention - blasted the CNSP for not having invited its leaders to preliminary talks about the transition.
""Today, everyone has doubts about them,"" said Issa Kaou Ndjim, one of the protest leaders. ""The CNSP needs to accept that they must talk with the people."" 
Then, on Thursday, teachers' unions, which have been striking this year over pay demands, accused the CNSP of misleading the public in comments about salary negotiations and said its actions were reminiscent of Keita's government. 
A CNSP spokesman was not immediately available for comment. 
Formal talks with political and civil society leaders are slated to open on Saturday in the West African nation's capital Bamako and other cities to hammer out a plan for the transition. 
In Bamako, many people are hopeful Keita's overthrow will lead to needed reforms but are also skeptical of lofty promises from their leaders.

Relations between NATO allies Turkey and France have deteriorated over conflicting policies in Syria, Libya and Turkey's dispute with Greece over energy resources, and the two sides have traded barbs in recent weeks.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan International Airlines, the Islamic nation's flag carrier, will not appeal against a six-month ban imposed on its lucrative flights to European locations, three officials said, in a blow to the ailing airline's pre-pandemic turnaround plans.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) banned PIA from flying to the bloc in June over safety concerns, days after the country grounded dozens of its pilots over allegedly dubious qualifications.
""We've decided that filing an appeal at this stage will be counter-productive,"" PIA spokesman Abdullah Khan told Reuters. 
The deadline to appeal expired on Aug 31.
Two civil aviation officials told Reuters that all the stakeholders agreed that an appeal would be a futile exercise until reforms in the regulatory framework and a full probe into the pilots' scandal were completed.
The civil aviation officials declined to be named. The government and the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority did not respond to requests for comment.
Opting not to appeal means the ban will remain in force until the end of 2020 - a year in which PIA was to implement a new business plan aimed at making the company profitable by 2023 - via a route rationalization, increasing flights and adding new sectors like Amsterdam.
With more than $4 billion in accumulated losses, PIA was already struggling financially when flights were grounded in March because of the pandemic. Just as it resumed operations in May, a domestic PIA flight crash in Karachi killed 97 of 99 people on board. 
An initial inquiry pointed to a number of safety failures, and sparked a disclosure from authorities that nearly a third of PIA's pilots may have falsified their qualifications, prompting EASA, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other regulators to ban PIA flights.
PIA had halted commercial flights to the United States before the ban, but was flying charter flights and had planned to restart operations there soon.
The European ban hurt its revenues from overseas sectors such as London, Manchester and Birmingham that were to be a cornerstone of PIA's turnaround strategy.
BREAK-EVEN
The business plan put together by the PIA management last year saw those UK routes and new European destinations as key to its turnaround strategy, which also involved inducting at least seven new aircraft to its fleet by 2022. 
The year ""2020 would be a break-even year followed by return to profitability in 2023,"" said the turnaround plan, reviewed by Reuters. It has not been made public.
The expansion plans are now on hold, and the airline plans to revise its turnaround strategy in consultation with the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said PIA's Khan.
IATA, which is to begin an operational safety audit of PIA this week, said the audit process was standard practice after aircrafts of registered airlines met with accidents.
In an emailed response to Reuters, Albert Tjoeng, IATA's Assistant Director of Corporate Communications for Asia Pacific, said IATA could not confirm or discuss the body's consulting projects keeping in view commercial confidentiality. 
""It's a routine audit consequent to which each airline gets an operational clearance certificate. PIA teams are all geared up for the audit,"" said PIA's Khan. 
As stated in its turnaround strategy, PIA's plans to divest non-core businesses such as food catering and ground handling remain on track and it is also set to hire an international consultant to advise on legacy debt, said Khan. 
The business plan noted that PIA's share of international flight traffic into Pakistan had fallen to 27% in 2019 down from 42% a few years prior.
Aside from operational issues, the report cited competition from Middle Eastern airlines as one of the main reasons behind the market share decline, and it proposed that Pakistan revisit its open skies strategy to allow PIA to be more competitive. 
The recent bans however, risk further denting PIA's market share with carriers such as Virgin Atlantic recently announcing direct flights into Pakistan to fill the PIA void.

The new projections of PIA's market share are being calculated, its spokesman said, adding the airline's management believes the decline on an annual basis will not be ""as brutal as predicted,"" due to the pandemic slowing down global traffic.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - It is not certain that Britain and the European Union will be able to seal a deal on their new relationship after Brexit, European Council President Charles Michel said on Friday, urging London to come clean on its state aid plans to unlock progress.
Speaking to Reuters and five other European news agencies, Michel said: ""Sooner or later, the UK should clarify what they want. It's not possible to leave the European club and at the same time keep all the benefits.""
""The UK should clarify its position. For us, the level-playing field is key and essential,"" he added. ""It's impossible that they diverge and there are no consequences, for example on tariffs.""
Michel spoke ahead of another negotiating round between the EU and Britain in London next week aimed at sealing a new partnership agreement from 2021 on everything from trade and security to cooperation on nuclear, transport and aviation. 
After the summer brought no breakthroughs on the key outstanding issues - the level-playing field guarantees of fair competition, fisheries and dispute settling - the EU has grown increasingly wary that an agreement may not come together in time for the bloc to be able to ratify it by year-end. 
The bloc's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, went to London last Sunday to tell his UK counterpart, David Frost, that Britain must move on state aid, or there will not be an agreement, according to EU diplomatic sources.
Michel said Barnier came back empty-handed ahead of what the bloc now says is a ""strict deadline"" of the end of October to seal a deal between the two sides.
A senior EU diplomat estimated chances for a deal against a rough split without an agreement to continue some of the current, close-knit cooperation, at 50-50. Michel refused to comment on that but said:
""We have no certainty that we'll reach a deal. I hope it will be possible - but not at all cost ... We defend European interests.""

Calling on Britain to clarify its future state aid plans - which the bloc worries London might use to support UK firms that would then gain an unfair advantage in offering their products on the EU's cherished single market of 450 million people, Michel said: ""It takes two to tango.""

The government agreed the move with the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, one of the groups that did not join a deal signed on Monday to end wars stemming from the rule of ousted leader Omar al-Bashir.
Hilu's group has now agreed with the Khartoum government on the ""necessity"" to reach a complete political solution in Sudan and address root the causes of its conflicts, the office of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok said on its website.
It said both sides had agreed to set up workshops for different issues but gave no timeframe or details.

""Yes, it is true. The meeting has taken place in Addis Ababa between us and Prime Minister Hamdok,"" Aman Amum, the group's chief negotiator, told Reuters. ""We will continue negotiation under Juba Mediation. So far, there's no agreed date for the talks.""

Hilu's group had orginally joined the Juba talks but then suspended its participation.
His group operates in a region inhabited by minority Christians and followers of African beliefs, who complain of long discrimination under Bashir, who was ousted last year, and seek a secular democratic state for the Muslim majority country.
The joint statement published by Hamdok's office said both sides had agreed to achieve equality for all Sudanese.
Sudan has been riven by conflicts for decades. After the oil-rich south seceded in 2011, an economic crisis fuelled protests which led to Bashir's ousting.
Three major groups signed Monday's deal, including factions from Darfur where more than 300,000 people are estimated to have been killed and 2.5 million displaced since 2003.

Sudan's civilian and military leaders, who have shared power since then, say ending conflicts is a top priority to help bring democracy and peace to a country in crisis.

PARIS (Reuters) - The right to mock and caricature, even religion, is an essential part of being French, President Emmanuel Macron said at a naturalisation ceremony on Friday, days after the start of a trial of the accused accomplices in an attack by Islamist gunmen on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015. 
In the Paris Pantheon, a mausoleum to France's heroes, Macron handed five new citizens their French papers in a solemn ceremony to mark the 150th anniversary of the Third Republic. 
""At the start of the trial of the attacks of January 2015, I say that to be French is to defend the right to laugh, jest, mock and caricature, of which Voltaire maintained that it is the source of all other rights,"" Macron said. 
More than a dozen defendants went on trial this week for their role in the killing spree in the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, where 12 people died. This week, the magazine republished the caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad that had sparked the ire of Islamist militants.
Welcoming five new citizens from Britain, Algeria, Cameroun, Peru and Lebanon, Macron said immigrants have long been a force for good in France, and noted that the Third Republic was proclaimed from Paris city hall by the son of an Italian immigrant, Leon Gambetta, on Sept. 4, 1870.
""He was, like you, a son of immigrants, French of mixed blood. It was he who resuscitated the republic, this reign of freedom,"" Macron said. 
Macron said many other immigrants have shaped French history, including Polish-born scientist Marie Curie, American-born singer Josephine Baker, Tunisian-born feminist Gisele Alimi, and Felix Eboue, France's first Black colonial governor and first Black man to have his ashes placed in the Pantheon.

""Now it is your turn to write your chapter in the book of the republic,"" he said.

Southeast Asia has been a preferred transit point to Turkey for ethnic Uighurs Muslims, fleeing what refugees and activists have described as oppression and mass internment by the Chinese government.
Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, Mohd Redzuan Md Yusof, said Malaysia respects the right of sovereign countries to manage their own internal affairs, even if it recognises that the Uighurs face oppression in China.
Mohd Redzuan's comments, made in a written parliamentary reply posted on the legislature's website, marked the first time Malaysia has taken a clear position to not extradite Uighur refugees.
""Hence, if there are any Uighur refugees who flee to Malaysia for protection, Malaysia has decided to not extradite Uighur refugees even if there is a request from the People's Republic of China,"" Mohd Redzuan said.
""They are allowed to move on to a third country should they fear for their safety or potentially face persecution, where they feel they would not receive protection and justice in their home country.""
It is unclear when the document was uploaded. China's embassy in Kuala Lumpur did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In October 2018, Malaysian authorities released https://reut.rs/3lPp389 11 Uighurs from detention and sent them to Turkey, despite a request from China to return them. 
China ""resolutely opposed"" that and then-premier Mahathir Mohamad said those released had ""done nothing wrong"" in Malaysia.
Mahathir later said Malaysia was too small a country to confront China over Uighurs.
The United Nations says at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained in what China describes as ""vocational training centers"" to stamp out extremism and give people new skills.

1276,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>","China planning building spree in Tibet as India tensions rise, sources say","BEIJING (Reuters) - China is planning a more than 1 trillion yuan ($146 billion) push to accelerate infrastructure investment in Tibet, including new and previously announced projects, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The renewed push to step-up development of the remote and impoverished southwestern region signals Beijing's intent to bolster frontier security amid heightened border tensions with India in recent months, two of the sources said.
Last week, during a senior Communist Party meeting on Tibet's future governance, President Xi Jinping lauded achievements and praised frontline officials but said more efforts were needed to enrich, rejuvenate and strengthen unity in the region.
He said a number of major infrastructure projects and public facilities would be completed, including the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, according to remarks published by the official Xinhua news agency.
The construction plans include completion of the challenging middle section of a high-elevation Sichuan-Tibet railway link, a railway line between Nepal and Tibet that has remained in the planning stages, and a newly planned dry port in the Tibet Autonomous Region, the sources said.
The sources declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak with media. 
It was not immediately clear how much of the targeted spending is new, or over how many years it would be invested. 
China's State Council Information Office and the Tibet regional government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Construction on the most difficult section of the Sichuan-Tibet railway - linking Chengdu with Lhasa - will begin in coming weeks, said two of the sources. 
The 270 billion yuan section of the railway has been known for construction challenges posed by rough terrain and complex geology, notably the segment linking Sichuan's Ya'an city with Nyingchi in southeastern Tibet near the border with India. 
Beijing also wants to push ahead with the Tibet-Nepal Railway linking Kathmandu with Shigatse, the second-largest city in Tibet, which was among a number of bilateral deals signed in 2018 between Nepal and China, but has yet to gain much traction.
Nepal is a buffer between China and India and is considered by New Delhi as its natural ally, but China has made inroads by pouring aid and infrastructure investment into what is one of the world's poorest countries.
A June clash in the western part of the China-India border was the worst violence between the Asian giants in decades, and there is little sign of easing tension, with more military action in the past week.
RAIL ACCESS
Beijing has long aimed to build a high-speed rail network to make Tibet more accessible from China's inland provinces, and it plans to improve or extend railways being planned or constructed that connect it with other parts of China, two of the sources said. 
Last month, China announced plans to expand the country's railway network by one-third over the next 15 years.
Within Tibet, the planned spending covers the revamp and expansion of highways, roads and scenic spots, two of the sources said. 
Beijing sent troops into Tibet in 1950 in what it officially terms a peaceful liberation and maintains a heavy security presence in the region, which has been prone to unrest.
China rejects criticism from rights groups and Tibetan exiles of its rule there, saying it has brought much-needed development to a remote region and that it respects Tibet's culture and religion.
China's policies towards Tibet have come under the spotlight again this year amid worsening ties with the United States.

    In July, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States would restrict visas for some Chinese officials involved in blocking diplomatic access to Tibet and engaging in ""human rights abuses"".

The migrants have no critical physical issues, but mentally the situation is getting desperate, the Maersk Etienne captain said, saying one migrant had threatened to jump overboard.
""We had a difficult time convincing him that jumping overboard will probably kill him. This just to give a picture of how desperate these people are,"" Volodymyr Yeroshkin said in a video recorded on Tuesday.
""We require immediate assistance. These people have to disembark as soon as possible,"" he said. ""They're anxious to get in touch with their loved ones and families. They just simply want to step ashore.""
The ship's crew rescued the migrants on Aug. 4 from a wooden dinghy that had been at sea for days and sank immediately after the rescue operation.
The migrants sleep on mattresses and blankets, some on the deck covered from the sun by impromptu shade sails.
""Maersk Etienne is a chemical tanker which is not equipped neither constructed to keeping people onboard. This is a cargo vessel, the crew are professional seafarers and none of them is qualified for medical assistance or for care for rescued people,"" Yeroshkin said.
Maersk Tankers, the operator of Maersk Etienne said that neither the Maltese, Italian nor Libyan authorities would let them come ashore.
""It's deeply unfair that we are treated this way for doing the right thing and acting as we are supposed to according to the international seafaring rules,"" Maersk tankers' Chief Technical Officer Tommy Thomassen said.
""The authorities need to provide a solution now."" 

The number of migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean to land on European shores from countries such as Tunisia and Libya has spiked in the past year.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The defense ministers of India and China are expected to hold talks in Moscow later on Friday, government officials said, the highest level face-to-face political contact since tensions flared along their disputed mountain border in May.
Both sides deployed additional forces along the frontier running through the western Himalayas, after a clash in June, during which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in hand-to-hand fighting.
Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh was given clearance to meet his Chinese counterpart Wei Fenghe in Moscow, where both are attending a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting, an Indian government official said. The request for the meeting came from the Chinese side, the official added.
""Subsequently a green signal was given for the meeting,"" the official said, asking not to be identified because of Indian service rules. 
There was no word from China, but Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of China's state-backed Global Times newspaper said on Twitter that a meeting between the defense ministers was expected.
Despite the brutality of the clash in June, both sides appeared to observe a protocol to avoid the use of firearms in the high altitude region. And while there have been no further clashes reported, the situation on the frontier remains tense.
Military commanders and diplomats have been holding talks to end the standoff on the Line of Actual Control, or the de facto border, but there has been little progress.
Last weekend, Indian officials said forces on the border mobilized to deter Chinese troops, whose movements suggested they aimed to occupy a hilltop that India considered to be within its territory.
""The situation along the LAC is slightly tense,"" Indian army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane told Reuters partner ANI during a tour of the frontier in the Ladakh region, adding that he believed talks could help resolve the situation.

A U.S. government source told Reuters in Washington that the U.S. assessment is that neither China nor India are interested in pushing the dispute to the point that they would engage in war.

Tensions escalated last month after Turkey dispatched a seismic survey vessel to a disputed area for energy exploration following a maritime deal between Greece and Egypt. Turkey says the pact infringes on its own continental shelf. 
""(Our country) can and wants to discuss the demarcation of maritimes zones in the Aegean Sea, in the eastern Mediterranean, based on international law. But not under threats,"" Mitsotakis said during a meeting with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi who is visiting Athens. ""Let the threats go for talks to begin.
""Once the provocations end, discussions will begin,"" he said, adding that Greece's foreign minister would deliver a letter from him outlining Athens' case to U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres when the two meet in New York on Friday. 
Mitsotakis spoke a day after NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that Greece and Turkey, both members of the Western alliance, had agreed to talks to avoid accidental clashes in the Eastern Mediterranean. 
Turkey said it supported NATO's initiative and that the talks were not about solving bilateral problems but about measures so far handled by the two countries' militaries. It added that it expected Greece to do the same. 

Commenting on NATO's announcement on Thursday, Greek diplomats said a condition for dialogue was that Turkey de-escalated its activity in the region.

CAMORINO, Switzerland (Reuters) - Switzerland officially opened the Ceneri Base Tunnel on Friday, the final piece in a direct, flat rail link connecting northern Europe to the Mediterranean via routes beneath the Alps.
The 15.4 kilometre (9.57 miles) tunnel marks the completion of the New Rail Link through the Alps (NRLA), a 22.8 billion Swiss franc ($25.04 billion) project dubbed Switzerland's construction project of the century.
Together with the 57.1 kilometre Gotthard Base Tunnel, the world's longest rail tunnel which opened in 2016, and the 34.6 kilometre Loetschberg tunnel, Ceneri completes a system that allows uninterrupted freight transport from Rotterdam and Genoa under the mountains.
""It's the last part of the puzzle,"" Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) Chief Executive Vincent Ducrot told reporters. ""The goal to have a flat rail line through the Alps has now been achieved.""
The tunnel, which has taken 10 years to build, runs beneath Monte Ceneri, replacing a steep surface railway which had a high-altitude tunnel at the top. Its north portal is situated
at Camorino, and the tunnel breaks through the mountains in the south at Vezia, near Lugano.
Switzerland wants to use the tunnel, which is due to enter service on Dec. 13. 2020, to transfer more freight transport from trucks to rail, decreasing CO2 emissions and protecting the Alpine environment. 
""The environmental benefit is obvious, but it's not only about the Alps,"" Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga, who attended the opening ceremony, told Reuters.
""It's a competitive advantage for Switzerland and a sustainable transport policy.""
The 3.6 billion franc tunnel, the culmination of Switzerland's efforts to ease the transalpine journey which began with the opening of the Gotthard summit tunnel in 1882, can carry up to 170 freight trains and 180 passenger trains per day.
The project's aim is to reduction in the number of trucks crossing the Alps to 650,000 per year, cutting daily CO2 emissions by 890 tonnes. Last year, there were around 900,000 transalpine truck journeys, according to Swiss Federal Office of Transport.
Eventually the Milan to Zurich train journey will be cut from around 4 hours to three hours, and the SBB plans to run direct trains to Bologna and Genoa. 
Freight trains will also be able to run uninterrupted along the 1,400 km stretch between Rotterdam to Genoa without technical hindrances.

Wearing white headbands to distinguish each other, the fighters from the CODECO militia surrounded Bunia's prison on Friday morning and demanded the release of their comrades.
It was not immediately clear why security forces did not stop the group, which is accused by the United Nations of violence that may amount to war crimes, from entering the city.
CODECO is one of an array of militias operating in the east of the country involved in fighting with the army and civilians, amid longstanding tensions over land and resources. 
A U.N. source said the CODECO fighters entered Bunia under escort from the national police. Videos circulating on social media showed Congolese soldiers holding back crowds of people as the fighters posed with guns and rocket launchers. No violence was reported.
""They have deviated to the prison where they are now in front of the police and the army,"" Bunia mayor Ferdinand Fimbo said by telephone.
The militia's spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.
Drawn largely from the Lendu ethnic group, CODECO is accused by the United Nations of widespread and systematic killings, beheadings, rape and other barbaric acts.
Army spokesperson Jules Ngongo said the situation was under control: ""They are harmless, only asking that they be taken care of by the 36th military region and seek the release of their fellow prisoners.""
In July the government sent several former warlords, including one just released after more than a decade in prison in The Hague and Congo for war crimes, to convince CODECO fighters to surrender.
Some elements of CODECO agreed to a unilateral ceasefire in August, although it remains unclear if that would stop the violence since the group split into several competing factions in March after the army killed its leader.
""We don't know if it's theater or what in Ituri (province). The CODECO militiamen came with weapons in full view of everyone,"" said Jean Bosco Lalo, president of a civil rights group in the province.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A Dutch appeals court will decide on Friday whether to overturn the racial incitement conviction of Geert Wilders, the far-right populist party chief who led supporters in chanting that they wanted fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands.
The trial of Wilders, one of Europe's most prominent far-right leaders, has been seen as pitting the rights of freedom of speech against the right of ethnic and religious minorities not to suffer verbal abuse and discrimination.
Wilders, 56, whose Freedom Party has at times topped national opinion polls, argues he did nothing wrong, and merely expressed openly what many Dutch people think. 
He was convicted in 2016 of inciting discrimination at a 2014 campaign rally, in which he led supporters in asking whether they wanted more or fewer Moroccans in the country.
""Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!"" his supporters chanted. ""We're going to take care of that,"" said the smiling Wilders.
Trial judges said Wilders had planned the remarks ahead of time knowing they would be inflammatory and insulting to the 400,000 people of Moroccan ancestry in the Netherlands.
They convicted him, saying that politicians are not ""above the law"", but issued no fine or other penalty. Wilders appealed, seeking to clear the conviction from his name and saying his trial was politically motivated.
On appeal, prosecutors asked the court to convict Wilders on an additional charge of inciting hatred against Moroccans based on their race and impose a fine of 5,000 euros ($5,930), or 60 days in prison if it is unpaid.
The appeals court's decision was expected around 1130 GMT.
Wilders said his words were a reference to his party's platform, which included policies such as expelling Moroccans with dual nationality who commit a crime, and encouraging immigrants to leave.
With his trademark coif of bleach blond hair, Wilders was among the first of a wave of anti-immigration populists in Europe, and frequently shocked the Dutch political establishment and offended Muslims with his anti-Islam rhetoric. 
He was acquitted in a 2011 hate speech trial for remarks likening Islam to Nazism and calling for a ban on the Koran.

Wilders has lived under constant police protection for more than a decade due to death threats.

BUKAVU, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - A city in eastern Congo has rallied in support of Denis Mukwege, the Congolese Nobel Laureate who received death threats in recent weeks after he called for justice over serious human rights violations.
On Thursday his supporters snaked through the streets of Bukavu, the lakeside home of the doctor who has helped thousands of survivors of sexual violence, honking motorcycle horns, singing and waving signs like ""Don't touch our Nobel Prize.""
Mukwege has won international recognition, including the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize, for his decades of work treating female victims conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Last week the United Nations said his life was in danger after he and his family received death threats via social media and by phone.
Alongside his medical work at Panzi hospital in Bukavu, Mukwege has long been an advocate for prosecuting armed groups responsible for the endemic sexual violence in eastern Congo. 
""Our sisters in the forest got raped and ruined. Some completely lost their wombs, and some carried their wombs in their hands,"" said Safina Kusimwa, one of the demonstrators.
""Mukwege put all his efforts into rescuing these women... we do not want to see this. They should leave him in peace.""
On August 24 he commemorated the anniversary of a 1998 massacre in Kasika where, he said in a statement, ""more than a thousand civilians, including many women as well as children and babies"" were killed, and ""most of the women were raped, tortured, and had their genitals mutilated.""
""Without truth and justice there will be no lasting peace in DR Congo and neither the victims nor the torturers will be able to rebuild a peaceful future for future generations,"" Mukwege said.

On Thursday the marchers called on the government to protect Mukwege, who narrowly survived an assassination attempt in 2012.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - In the days that followed the Beirut port explosion, Shady Rizk played a video he had taken on his phone again and again.
Filmed from the balcony of his office directly opposite the port, it shows flames and smoke rising from what some officials knew were burning explosives. Suddenly there is a huge bang, flying glass and the screen goes black.
""We had 20 minutes (before the explosion), they should have told us to evacuate, stopped the traffic,"" said the 36-year-old, who worked at an internet provider before his life shattered along with its offices on that August 4 day.
Amid howls from injured colleagues he heard the office phone ring. Temporarily blinded, he reached for it, only to hear a customer calling to complain about internet speed.
""We are dying here. Please call the ambulance,” he shouted, along with expletives. Now he says he is grateful for that call because it helped him find the phone to ring home.
""It was my sister who picked up, I told her I was dying, to send my regards to everyone ... and to stay on the line.""
Rizk survived, with 350 stitches across his body, including all over his face. He still has problems with his vision.
His biggest disappointment one month on is that no government official has been questioned or arrested in connection with the explosion of the 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored unsafely at the port for years.
""Lebanon is always going to be beautiful but those who are governing it are making it very, very ugly, disturbing. It has become very ugly despite its beauty,"" he said.
Rizk was one of the tens of thousands of Lebanese who took part in protests in October against sectarian rule, endemic corruption and an economic slide now compounded by the sudden loss of livelihoods and the homes of a quarter of a million people.
""We tried to make a revolution. We tried to change. We tried so many things and nothing. In fact it is getting worse, is this possible?"" he said.
When plastic surgeon Joe Baroud finally removed the stitches on his face, they agreed he would never be quite the same again.
""There are no scars that completely disappear, of the soul or of the flesh,"" said Baroud, who treated dozens of people who suffered facial scars in the blast, which killed at least 190 people. ""Time will heal, but it will not be normal skin. Never.""
Haunted by flashbacks, Rizk decided last week to go back to his office block in the now desolate Mar Mikhael neighbourhood. There, held by his best friend, he cried for the first time, sadness mixing with relief and resolve.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka began towing a fully loaded supertanker that had caught fire off its east coast after it began drifting towards land, a spokesman for the navy of the Indian Ocean nation said on Friday.
The fire was still raging on the New Diamond tanker carrying about 2 million barrels of oil, said the spokesman, Captain Indika de Silva. There were 23 crew on board, one of whom is presumed dead. The rest have been taken off the ship by the Sri Lankan navy, with one injured crew member flown to the capital Colombo for treatment.
There were no signs of an oil leak from the vessel, de Silva added. Ships from the Russian navy and the Indian coastguard have been assisting in the firefighting. 
The fire that broke out in the engine room of the New Diamond on Thursday morning had spread to the bridge of the ship, chartered by Indian Oil Corp (IOC) (NS:IOC), though it has yet to reach the cargo area, the Sri Lankan navy said. 
Graphic - Ablaze & adrift: Sri Lanka began towing the supertanker New Diamond to safety after it drifted towards land: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gjnvwaryevw/NewDiamondSep4.png
Initially, the ship was stranded 38 km (24 miles) east of the Sri Lankan town of Thirukovil, but drifted within 25 km of the coast after being abandoned. Authorities were now towing it eastward, away from the coast, de Silva said.
Thirukovil is a town in Sri Lanka's Ampara district that was badly battered by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Arugam Bay, a world-renowned surfing spot, is nearby. 
""The missing Filipino sailor is presumed dead. He was badly injured when a boiler exploded,"" de Silva told Reuters, citing crew who were rescued.
""There were 5 Greek and 18 Philippine nationals among the crew. One of them was injured and he was airlifted out of the ship and the rest were accounted for."" 
While there are no signs of a leak, Sri Lanka's meteorology department has already modelled the impact of 70,000 tonnes of crude oil - a quarter of the ship's cargo - spilling into the ocean.
The simulation, a worst case scenario according to authorities, found that such a spill would not immediately threaten the country's east coast.
But Dharshani Lahandapura, chair of Sri Lanka's federal Marine Environment Protection Authority, told Reuters that any spill from the ship would be catastrophic for marine life. 
""It will be a huge environmental and economic disaster if this happens,"" she said.
The 1989 oil spill from the Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez, considered one of the worst human-caused environmental disasters, spewed about 37,000 tonnes of crude into waters off Alaska. 

The New Diamond had sailed from the port of Mina Al Ahmadi in Kuwait, loaded with Kuwait Export Crude, Refinitiv Eikon tracking data showed. It was heading for the Indian port of Paradip, where state-run IOC has a 300,000 barrel-per-day refinery.

Several maritime reports logged over the past two years showed the ship may have had some mechanical defects and revealed operational concerns.
A December inspection report from Indonesian authorities on the website of Equasis, which collates ship safety information from both public and private sources, logged issues with the ship's propulsion and auxiliary machinery. 
The issues included ""deficiencies"" with the propulsion main engine and gauges, thermometers.
A 2019 report by the Australian government on the cattle ship's transit in June from Australia to Indonesia noted the vessel's departure was delayed for a week because of ""stability and navigation issues identified by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA)"". 
AMSA's website showed Gulf Livestock 1 was detained by the Australian authorities for three days in May 2019, because of issues related to its navigation Electronic Chart Display and Information System. The report cited both a lack of up-to-date charts and training for officers using the system.
A report on the website of FleetMon, a German-based maritime tracking site, shows the ship, under its previous name of Rahmeh, anchored off the Turkish coast in September 2018 ""to fix a mechanical problem"" that required the delivery of spare parts. 
The FleetMon report also noted some concern from local residents about the ship's extended stay at Cesme port, because livestock on a previous voyage had been found to be infected with anthrax. 
Gulf Navigation, Marconsult Schiffarht and Hijazi & Ghosheh Co. did not immediately respond to questions about the reports. 
SEARCH CONTINUES
The Japanese coastguard said on Friday it had not set a deadline to end the search for survivors from the ship, which left Napier port in New Zealand on Aug. 14 and was due to arrive 17 days later at the Port of Jingtang in Tangshan, China.
Four vessels, an airplane and several divers were scouring the waters on Friday when they discovered the second crew member, who has not been publicly identified.
The coastguard said the man had died a short time after they pulled him from the sea about 120 km (75 miles) north-northwest of Amami Oshima island and transferred him to hospital. 
Melbourne-based Australasian Global Exports confirmed it employed four of the people onboard, with the remaining crew engaged by Gulf Navigation.
""We are in full contact with the families of our four colleagues and are offering them all the support we can,"" it said in a statement.
The crew was made up of 39 people from the Philippines, two from New Zealand, and two from Australia, the coastguard said.

Edvarodo, the 45-year-old Filipino crew member rescued on Wednesday, remains in hospital.

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>","China's international schools struggle as teachers, students remain stuck abroad","By Engen Tham and Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's international schools are reopening this month but will be short of key elements - teachers and pupils.
Schools across the world are grappling with disruptions, but the situation for international schools in China is particularly challenging as swathes of staff and students left the country for Lunar New Year holidays just as the coronavirus spread and many are still stranded overseas due to travel restrictions.
As many as 40% of teachers and students due to start the term this month remain abroad, according to the Association of China and Mongolia International Schools which represents 58 schools catering to mostly foreign nationals.
A survey of its member schools in China in early July found just over 3,000 teachers and their dependents were unable to enter China, and it estimated another 700 people from schools which did not respond could be in the same position.
""This is probably the biggest issue that we have faced as an organisation since SARS in 2003,"" said Tom Ulmet, executive director at the association, adding that schools were trying to cope with the lack of teachers by increasing class sizes and moving lessons online.
Authorities have begun processing visa applications for foreign staff in China, but flying into China is not easy due to a limited number of international flights. A number of foreigners including teachers have also had their applications for visas rejected, although the reasons behind the rejections and the proportion of visas rejected are unclear.
When travel restrictions might ease further and whether there will be a lasting impact on student numbers and international school budgets also remains to be seen.
Chinese-run schools employing foreign teachers are facing similar difficulties.
One such school, YK Pao, has shifted some lessons online as seven out of 19 new primary school staff would not be physically at school for the start of the academic year, according to a text message sent to parents. YK Pao did not respond to requests for comment.
Foreign teachers who have managed to enter China told Reuters they have had to take on bigger workloads. 
""When we arrived back, they extended our day by an hour, our free periods and planning time were taken up by cover,"" said a foreign teacher at a private school in Shanghai, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media. 
Many working in international schools say the full scale of the shortfall in students will only become apparent at the start of the next term assuming border restrictions ease substantially. By then, expatriate families uncertain about their return as foreign firms slash costs amid the pandemic and U.S.-China tensions, will have had time to decide.
Even before the travel restrictions, business for international schools had already been declining as companies have been sending fewer expats and their children to China due to cost cuts, said Mark Upton, chief executive of consultancy Upto U Education Services.

1291,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 12:45AM ET</span>","Trump-Xi Rift Plays Out With Some 100 Canceled Exchanges, Talks","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s revelation last month that he hadn’t spoken with his Chinese counterpart in “a long time” and isn’t interested in doing so is just the tip of a much broader breakdown in communications that’s stoking concerns among former officials from both sides.
When the Trump administration took office in 2017, there were about 100 officially organized exchange forums -- touching on everything from pharmaceuticals to technology policy -- between the two countries, according to Arthur Kroeber, a China analyst for almost three decades. Gao Zhikai, a former Chinese diplomat who served as translator to Deng Xiaoping, cites the same tally.
Almost all of these dialogues have now died, meaning that senior and mid-level officials on both sides are increasingly operating in the dark about their opposite numbers’ activities and intentions. That raises the risk of misunderstandings festering or escalating into crises, and inhibits cooperation that otherwise could contain emerging disasters, such as Covid-19.
The “collapse of these structures is not the trigger of a bad relationship, but the result of a relationship worsening,” said John Pomfret, author of “The Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom,” a history of Sino-American ties over more than two centuries.
Despite reaching a “phase one” trade agreement early this year, U.S.-China ties are at their worst in decades. With a focus squarely on the looming election, Trump blamed Xi’s government for not controlling the Covid-19 outbreak before it became a pandemic, killing more than 185,000 Americans. U.S. politicians have expressed outrage over Beijing’s tightening grip over Hong Kong and its treatment of Muslim minorities, targeting officials for sanctions in both situations.
TikTok, Hong Kong and More U.S.-China Flashpoints: QuickTake
The bilateral discussions canceled or abandoned since Trump took office might not have been able to solve entrenched issues, like the expanding face-off between the two sides in the disputed South China Sea -- the most likely site of any military conflict. But people involved in them in the past say they can help promote back-channel diplomacy and a more nuanced view of the negotiating teams on the other side.
“You need some tracks that are basically talking shops,” said Kroeber, managing director of GaveKal Dragonomics, an independent global economic research firm. Having those forums fosters “relationships that can come into play at times of stress and crisis,” he added.
One key framework for U.S.-China dialog was the 16 or so working groups under the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, or JCCT, which was established during the Reagan administration in 1983 as a forum for high-level talks. It linked a wide variety of U.S. and Chinese agencies, from those dealing with commerce to energy, the environment and agriculture.
China Seeks to Calm U.S. Tension Even While Firing Back at Trump
The Trump administration terminated the JCCT in 2017, along with the Strategic and Economic Dialogue program that was led by the Treasury and State departments. They were replaced with the more narrowly, results-driven Comprehensive Economic Dialogue.
“People felt there was a lot of wasted time and there was a lot of process over substance,” in the previous system, said James Green, who worked at the State Department and U.S. Trade Representative’s office in the Obama administration. For a swath of U.S. agencies, however, “oftentimes the only way to get to their Chinese counterparts was through some kind of dialog structure,” bringing value to the set-up, he said.
They could be useful in practical ways, too.
“U.S.-China collaboration was an important part of the anti-SARS campaign in 2003,” Jennifer Bouey, a senior researcher at RAND Corp., wrote in a July 2019 study. SARS was a pandemic not unlike a smaller scale of Covid-19, which has been a source of friction rather than collaboration between the two countries.
Missed Opportunities
Data and technology sharing, along with U.S. assistance in building China’s public health system and biomedical research, “have benefited both countries and the world,” Bouey wrote. Given China’s rank as the top manufacturer of health products, pharmaceutical ingredients and vaccines, joint work between the two nation’s regulators could help ensure best practices are followed, she noted.
Among potential missed opportunities: applying a template of past work on monitoring influenza control to strengthened real-time analysis of synthetic opioid drug use, the RAND analysis showed.
As the travel industry looks to new standards and procedures in the post-coronavirus era, the U.S.-China Travel & Tourism Working Group won’t be around to coordinate approaches between the world’s two largest economies.
More broadly, soft diplomacy is no longer being developed between the two sides as civilian interactions decline. The U.S. announced in January that it would stop sending Peace Corps volunteers to China after nearly 30 years. And both governments have moved to curtail Chinese student flows to American institutions.
‘Slide Toward Mediocrity’
Officials at China’s embassy in Washington said in a statement that the country stands ready to “restore and restart the dialogue mechanisms at all levels and in all areas. All issues can be put on the table. And all differences can be addressed properly through dialogue.”
A spokesperson for the State Department referred to a July 23 speech Secretary of State Michael Pompeo gave at the Richard Nixon presidential library in California, in which he said Xi seeks to tyrannize the world and vowed that the U.S. won’t “bend the knee” to Beijing.
While China has benefited from partnering with U.S. agencies in the past, there’s been resistance among those who see their country’s rise as coming at the expense of the U.S. There is a view among some in Xi’s government that the U.S. “is on an ineluctable slide toward mediocrity,” Pomfret said. And taken as a whole, the dialogs “were never really good at keeping the relationship on an even keel.”
Even so, worrying to observers on both sides is how the breakdown plays out against a backdrop of deepening national security tensions.
History shows the potential for mishaps that test the bilateral relationship. In the military sphere, one came in the early months of the George W. Bush administration. A Chinese warplane collided with an American EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft, forcing it to land on a Chinese airbase on Hainan Island. The 2001 incident prompted stronger military-to-military dialogs and exchanges in order to contain the impact of such occurrences in future.
U.S. Ends Pacts With Hong Kong on Extradition, Shipping Tax
While interaction between the two militaries is usually professional, the risk of confrontation and misunderstanding remains. In 2018, a Chinese warship came within 45 yards of the USS Decatur as it sailed near disputed reefs. Last week, the People’s Liberation Army to fired four medium-range ballistic missiles into the disputed South China Sea.
There’s also space for escalation outside the military realm. China’s preferred means of retaliation against the U.S. and its allies usually involves so-called gray zone tactics that stop short of direct confrontation. One possible example: last year’s detention of two Canadians days after Canada’s arrest of a high-profile Chinese executive.
A similar situation with a U.S. citizen might pose a test for Washington.
“Even in the best-case scenario, to have frictions and problems of all kinds between them should be considered normal,” Gao, the ex-diplomat who’s now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization, said of the two countries. “China-U.S. dialogs and conversations of all kinds are especially important.”

1292,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 12:36AM ET</span>","U.K. Car Sales Stumble in August, in Setback to Summer Recovery","(Bloomberg) -- U.K. new-car registrations dropped 5% in August, in another step back for the industry after signs of progress climbing out of the coronavirus-driven sales slump.
The decline, based on preliminary data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, follows the U.K.’s first monthly gain of 2020 in July. While it mirrors declines in France and Spain, the longer-term trend remains unclear because August is typically one of the year’s quietest months.
“What seems far more significant is the outlook for September and beyond, which remains positive as the industry continues its recovery from lockdown,” Ian Plummer, director at sales site Auto Trader, said in a separate statement. He said consumer visits had increased more than 30% in August from a year earlier, and order books at dealers signal “a promising September.”
The SMMT will release final August data later on Friday.
July’s growth had been driven by pent-up demand as well as commuters looking for alternatives to public transport. There was some optimism that the bump would extend in August if school reopenings and freedom from months of lockdowns reinforced the trend.
More: French, Spanish Car Sales Drop in Blow to Virus Recovery Hope
Dealer discounts and attractive financing rates, along with a license-plate changeover that occurs each September, may indeed trigger a resumption in growth, Plummer said. That, he said, “will be the true measure of the health of the new car market.”
EV Sales
The SMMT has previously warned that uncertainty about the economy and the U.K.’s exit from the European Union would continue to weigh on carmakers. Last month, Jaguar Land Rover, the U.K.’s largest carmaker, said it would slash costs by 2.5 billion pounds ($3.3 billion).
One bright spot for the industry has been electrified vehicles. Their sales of have more than doubled over the past year and carmakers now have 83 plug-in hybrid and full electric models on sale in the country, the SMMT said.
Registration of battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles are likely to show growth in August when final figures come out, the SMMT said, driven by several key new models coming out. But market shares is still small.
The SMMT is seeking government incentives to be reintroduced on plug-in hybrids to get more buyers to switch, as well as binding targets on charging infrastructure.
“If the UK is to become a global leader in the drive to net zero, we need industrial as well as market transformation,” SMMT chief Mike Hawes said in the statement. “This will require a bold strategy to retain and grow our automotive manufacturing base, and attract new investment.”

1293,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 12:10AM ET</span>",South Korean doctors expected to end strike amid COVID cases surge,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean doctors agreed on Friday to end a two-week strike which has complicated efforts to curb a new wave of coronavirus infections, after overnight talks over the government's medical reform plans. 
About 16,000 intern and resident doctors have been on strike since Aug. 21. Trainee doctors are the backbone of healthcare services in emergency rooms and intensive care units, and volunteer at temporary testing stations.
The doctors oppose the reform proposals, which include increasing the number of doctors, building public medical schools, allowing state insurance to cover more oriental medicine, and expanding telemedicine. 
The government says the initiatives could help better deal with health crises like the coronavirus, but the doctors argued it would only deepen the concentration of physicians in cities without improving poor medical infrastructure and work conditions in rural provinces. 
The government had agreed to halt the reforms and discuss them again with the industry and the parliament once the coronavirus outbreak had stabilised, according to ruling party officials who brokered the agreement. 
""We take it as a pledge to drop those plans and start again from square one,"" said Choi Dae-zip, president of the Korean Medical Association (KMA), during a meeting with the party officials. 
Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun welcomed the ""dramatic compromise,"" saying the doctors' return to work would help facilitate the operation of hospitals. 
There were lingering signs of discord between doctors however, with a leader of a trainees' group saying on Twitter that she was unaware of the deal. An event scheduled for Friday morning to sign an agreement between the KMA and the health ministry was postponed to the afternoon without explanation. 
A KMA spokesman did not respond to queries about when the doctors will restart work.
Choi said the initial aim of blocking key elements of the reform agenda was achieved and further discussions were needed, but doctors should now resume work. 
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 198 new coronavirus cases as of midnight Thursday, bringing the total to 20,842 with 331 deaths. The daily tally fell below 200 for the first time in more than two weeks on Thursday, though an ongoing rise in critical cases exacerbated shortfalls in hospital beds. 

The ministry had issued a back-to-work order for the doctors and filed a police complaint against several strike leaders.

“We’re working on measures to not only stop the decline but also increase fisheries exports to reach about $9 billion for all of 2020,” Tran Dinh Luan, general director of the agriculture ministry’s fisheries department, said in an interview in Hanoi.
The country shipped $8.6 billion of fisheries products last year, before exports fell 5.3% in the first eight months of 2020. The year-to-date drop has narrowed from an 8.6% contraction in the first half, with shipments beginning to revive in July and August, Luan said.
Export-reliant Vietnam is trying to maintain growth, with Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc last week urging ministries and provinces to boost their efforts to prevent a contraction. The government forecasts gross domestic product growth of 2.4% this year -- the slowest in two decades -- after a 0.36% expansion in the second quarter.
Vietnam is taking the following steps:
The agriculture ministry aims to increase 2020 farm exports to more than $41 billion, from about $40 billion last year, Luan said. Vietnam expects to pass Thailand this year to become the world’s second-largest rice exporter, he said.

1295,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 10:50PM ET</span>",U.N. experts decry Hong Kong security law in letter to China,"By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. human rights experts have told China a new security law for Hong Kong ""infringes on certain fundamental rights"" and voiced concerns that it could be used to prosecute political activists in the former British colony.
In a rare joint letter made public on Friday, 48 hours after it was sent to the Chinese government, they also said provisions of the new law appear to undermine the independence of Hong Kong's judges and lawyers, and the right to freedom of expression.
The ""open letter"" reflected a detailed legal analysis of the national security law imposed in Hong Kong on June 30, which had already drawn U.N. criticism before its adoption.
The law allows for anything China views as subversive, secessionist, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces to be punished with up to life in prison. Authorities in Beijing and the financial centre have said the law is necessary to ensure Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
Critics say the legislation further erodes the wide-ranging freedoms promised to Hong Kong on its return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" agreement.
The 14-page letter, posted on the website of the U.N. human rights office, was sent by Fionnuala Ni Aolain, U.N. special rapporteur on protecting human rights while countering terrorism, and six other U.N. experts.
The independent experts said the law's measures do not conform to China's legal obligations under international law and voiced concern that the legislation ""lacks precision in key respects, (and) infringes on certain fundamental rights"".
The law ""should not be used to restrict or limit protected fundamental freedoms, including the rights to opinion, expression, and of peaceful assembly,"" they said.
The group also expressed concern that ""many legitimate activities"" of human rights defenders in Hong Kong would be redefined as illegal. 
The experts urged China to explain how it plans to enforce ""extra-territorial jurisdiction"" contained in the new law so as to ensure it complies with a landmark international treaty on civil and political rights, signed by Beijing.
Protests in Hong Kong last year were fuelled by perceptions that Communist Party-ruled Beijing was tightening its grip on freedoms, which authorities have denied. 
They began with peaceful marches against a since-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, but clashes between police and protesters became more violent over following months.
China should appoint a ""fully independent reviewer"" to examine the law's compliance with its international human rights obligations, the experts said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian writer Yang Hengjun, detained by Chinese authorities for 18 months, has told family he has refused to make a false confession, as his case appears to move closer to trial.
Yang's lawyer was on Thursday allowed access to the Beijing detention facility where the 55-year-old writer is being held, for the first time since he was detained in January 2019, friends said. 
Yang was formally charged with suspicion of espionage in March this year. Australia has strongly objected to the indictment.
""I am innocent and will fight to the end"" Yang said in a message to his family, according to a friend, the University of Technology Sydney Professor Feng Chongyi.
""I will never confess to something I haven't done,"" he said in the message, a friend of Yang's, Feng told Reuters.
Relations between Australia and China have become increasingly strained, and Beijing has said it was angered by Australia's call for an inquiry into the source of the coronavirus pandemic.
On Monday Australia's foreign ministry revealed a second Australian journalist, the high-profile Chinese state television host Cheng Lei, had been detained by Chinese authorities.
The Australian government hasn't been told why Cheng was detained. 
Yang, a prominent Chinese blogger, was intercepted by security officials at Guangzhou airport as he arrived on a visit from New York, where he lived.
Yang's family has appointed prominent Chinese human rights lawyer Mo Shaoping, who previously defended jailed Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo in a 2009 trial.
Feng said under the Chinese legal system there is six weeks left for Chinese prosecutors to take the case to court. 
Yang has been interrogated for extended periods during his detention, his friends have said.
""This is a system designed to break people and force them to confess,"" said Human Rights Watch Australia director Elaine Pearson.
She noted acquittals in the Chinese legal system were rare.
Australian consular officials had videolink access with Yang on Monday, the first this year, after visits were suspended amid the coronavirus.

The U.S. bank was discharged amounting to acquittal, according to court proceedings in Kuala Lumpur on Friday.
The move marks progress in Goldman Sachs’s efforts to resolve its worst scandal since the financial crisis as it grapples with separate discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice for a settlement over 1MDB.
As part of the deal with Malaysia, the bank had paid $2.5 billion in cash to Malaysia last week and pledged to guarantee the return of $1.4 billion from 1MDB assets seized around the world over the coming years. In exchange, Malaysia would drop criminal charges against the bank’s units over accusations that they misled investors in raising billions of dollars for 1MDB while allegedly knowing the funds would be misappropriated.
Goldman Sachs had to boost its legal reserves by $2.01 billion to account for the Malaysia settlement, shaving its second-quarter net income by 85% and wiping out what had been a surprise jump in profit due to trading gains.
The scandal surrounding 1MDB had led to the ouster of Malaysia’s former premier Najib Razak in 2018 and triggered corruption investigations in at least 10 countries including Singapore and Switzerland. Najib was found guilty of corruption last month and sentenced to 12 years in jail in the first trial over the scandal to reach a conclusion, while Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, the alleged mastermind, is yet to be found.

The survey highlights the growing momentum for Suga, the government's chief spokesman, who emerged as the front-runner to replace Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this week after securing the backing of several of his party's key factions.
Suga has 38% of the public's support, ahead of 25% for former Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba who had previously led several media opinion polls. Fumio Kishida, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's policy chief, came in last with 5%.
In a June Asahi survey, Ishiba led a pack of seven potential contenders with 31% while Suga had just 3%.
A longtime aide to Abe, who is resigning due to poor health, Suga said on Wednesday he had decided to run for party leader to avoid a political vacuum during the coronavirus pandemic.
The leadership election is set for Sept. 14 with LDP lawmakers and regional party representatives casting votes. The winner is virtually assured of becoming prime minister because of the LDP's parliamentary majority.
Suga is arguably the government's most recognizable face after Abe, having served as chief spokesman for more than seven years and conducting twice daily press briefings. 
He is known as ""Uncle Reiwa"" for unveiling the name of Japan's new imperial era last year.
The Asahi also polled respondents on the qualities needed to make a good prime minister, with ""leadership"" coming in first at 37%. 

Among those who chose leadership, 43% supported Suga, versus 20% for Ishiba, suggesting his popularity has been bolstered by his high visibility in his role as chief cabinet secretary.

NUEVO LEON, Mexico (Reuters) - Using drones, shovels and picks, desperate Mexicans resumed searching for disappeared family members across remote parts of the country, restarting a torturous process that was largely halted when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March.
More than 73,000 people are classified as missing in Mexico, most of whom are believed to be victims of drug cartel warfare since Mexico launched its so-called 'War on Drugs' in 2006. The searches are largely carried out by family members.
In recent days family members and non-government organizations devoted to finding the remains of the dead and missing resumed so-called ""mega searches"" that are sometimes given support by government agencies.
In one such effort, drones buzzed above anxious family members who poked the ground with picks in the mountains and ravines in the municipality of Hidalgo in the northern Mexican Nuevo Leon state, according to Reuters witnesses.
""It's tremendous (to be doing this again),"" said Leticia Hernandez, whose son went missing eight years ago. ""It was six months of despair to know that we couldn't go out to look for our loved ones.""
Mexico has been one of the world's hardest-hit countries by the novel coronavirus outbreak, registering more than 66,000 deaths. The government and many organizations halted non-vital work, including searches for the missing.
While climbing a hill surrounded by trees and narrow dirt roads, the Hidalgo search party found what appeared to be an incinerator for human remains, Hernandez said. The military and civilian government agents were also involved in the search.
""A tin drum caught our attention,"" said Hernandez, the founder of the United Forces for Our Disappeared organization in Nuevo Leon. ""Our surprise was that inside there were quite a few charred bone remains.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Bolivia's interim presidency said on Thursday it had hired a Washington-based lobbying firm that  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) accuses of launching fake news campaigns to skew democratic debate.
Bolivia's interim government, which assumed power in a vacuum after the resignation of longtime leftist leader Evo Morales late last year, said it hired CLS Strategies in December in an effort to shore up its international support. 
In a statement, the government said CLS' mandate was to ""carry out lobbying in search of backing for Bolivian democracy after fraudulent elections and in support of the holding of new presidential polls."" 
CLS introduced Bolivian officials to members of the U.S. executive branch and legislature, the government said, adding that it had not asked CLS to conduct any other service or activity. 
Facebook said in a report https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/August-2020-CIB-Report.pdf on Tuesday that it had removed fake social media accounts linked to CLS that had posted content in support of caretaker Bolivia's President Jeanine Anez and the political opposition to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. 
The company had also posted negative content about the party of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico, Facebook said. 
In the same report, Facebook said it has also dismantled a Russian influence operation posing as an independent news outlet to target left-wing voters in the United States and Britain. 
Anez, a conservative former senator, assumed the presidency in Bolivia in November after Morales stepped down when an international audit of elections he won claimed to have found evidence of fraud.
She later threw her hat into the ring for Bolivia's presidential elections due to take place in October. 
Facebook said CLS violated its policy against foreign interference - which it defines as ""coordinated inauthentic behavior on behalf of a foreign entity"" - by using fake Facebook and Instagram profiles to amplify content it created including mocked-up local news, civic organizations and political supporters' sites. 
The U.S. social media giant said the fake accounts posted about news and current events, including politics and political figures, elections and political crises in Venezuela, Mexico and Bolivia. 
It removed a total of 55 fake Facebook accounts, 42 pages and 36 Instagram accounts, it added. 
Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of security policy, said in a tweet that CLS' activity ""continues a trend we have seen of PR firms around the world making a business out of this type of deception."" 
""If we see networks like this, we will continue to remove them and attribute them publicly,"" he added. 
In a statement sent to Reuters, CLS Strategies highlighted what it called Facebook's recognition, during a call with journalists about its report, that CLS had ""a large portion of legitimate activity that isn’t designed for this purpose."" 
It rejected Facebook´s claim of foreign interference, saying: ""Our work was funded and directed by clients inside each of the countries. None of this work was conducted on behalf of foreign entities.""
""CLS has a long tradition of doing international work, including on social media, to promote free and open elections and to oppose oppressive regimes, and we take seriously our commitment to adhering to the fast-evolving policies of Facebook and other social media platforms,” the statement added. 
Morales, who ran Bolivia for 14 years before leaving the country, has accused Anez and others of leading a U.S.-backed coup against him.
He said in a tweet on Wednesday that the Facebook report provided evidence of a ""dirty war"" against MAS - his party. ""Today, Facebook took a step by eliminating a network hired by the de facto government to spread its lies,"" he said. 
The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At least 7,000 health workers around the world have died after becoming infected with the coronavirus, including 1,320 in Mexico, Amnesty said. 
Other countries with high mortality rates include United States, Brazil and India, where health worker death tolls stand at 1,077, 634 and 573.
""Many months into the pandemic, health workers are still dying at horrific rates in countries such as Mexico, Brazil and the USA,"" said Steve Cockburn, Head of Economic and Social Justice at Amnesty International.
""There must be global cooperation to ensure all health workers are provided with adequate protective equipment, so they can continue their vital work without risking their own lives.""
The United States, Brazil and India have registered the highest number of overall deaths and confirmed cases. Between them, they have recorded more than 14 million coronavirus cases and almost 387,000 deaths, according to Reuters data.
A Reuters analysis of Mexican government data in August found that the healthcare workers' risk of dying in Mexico is four times higher than in the United States, and eight times higher than in Brazil.
Mexico has registered more than 610,000 cases and nearly 66,000 deaths. Mexico's government earlier this week said 102,494 health workers had contracted coronavirus and the death toll had climbed to 1,378.
Amnesty called for more help for workers, citing Brazil as an example of a place where health professionals complain about the lack of protection equipment.

""Throughout the pandemic governments have hailed health workers as heroes, but this rings hollow when so many workers are dying from a lack of basic protection,"" added Cockburn.

TOKYO (Reuters) - In the days leading up to Shinzo Abe's surprise resignation last month as rumors of his ill health swirled in Japan, the prime minister's right-hand man, Yoshihide Suga, was courting a ruling party boss whose backing could make him king. 
In a secluded dining room in an upscale Tokyo hotel, Suga met with Toshihiro Nikai, the secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), for a traditional Japanese meal. They shared stories from their youth when they both worked as secretaries for powerful politicians, according to a columnist who dined with them.
The dinner, Nikai's third with Suga in as many months, came little over a week before Abe stepped down as Japan's longest-serving premier and highlighted the kind of alliance-building that has made Suga the leading candidate to replace him.
At the dinner, Suga thanked Nikai for keeping a firm grip over the LDP, saying it had allowed Abe's administration to execute its policies with ease, according to Fumiya Shinohara, the political columnist who was there with them.
Two weeks later, Nikai's group was the first among the party's factions to endorse Suga for the top job, support that makes him almost certain to be Japan's next prime minister.
""In an environment where human relationships are paramount, that has been Mr. Suga's best weapon,"" said Shinohara, adding that their exchange over dinner cemented an alliance now poised to control the ruling party.
Suga's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the dinner. Suga has said, when asked on television about their discussion, that he and Nikai share a similar background and that he had introduced him to various people. 
Nikai could not immediately be reached for comment.
For the past eight years, Suga, 71, has been the public face of the Abe administration as the government's top spokesman but long kept a relatively low profile. He became better known to the public when he unveiled the name, Reiwa, of the new imperial era last year, a celebratory moment that marked the ascension of the new emperor and went viral, earning him the nickname ""Uncle Reiwa"".
Behind the scenes, associates and analysts say Suga has been instrumental in shifting elements of decision making from Japan's sprawling bureaucracy to the premier's office and taming factional rivalries within the ruling party.
Suga is widely expected to stay the policy course set out by his predecessor, maintaining the ""Abenomics"" pro-growth stimulus policies aimed at pulling Japan out of deflation and keeping the economy afloat during the coronavirus pandemic. [L4N2FZ07S][L4N2FZ2FU]
""Suga will carry on the vision Abe is handing over to him,"" said Takashi Ryuzaki, a political analyst and former TV journalist. ""So there is no need for Suga to have his own vision.""
'SOMEONE YOU WOULDN'T NOTICE'
In contrast to Abe, the scion of a political dynasty in Japan who staked his career on constitutional reform, Suga began his political career an outsider and rose through the ranks in local politics.
At a news conference on Wednesday where he officially announced his bid, Suga spoke about growing up in a farming community in Japan's northern Akita prefecture. 
""He was very quiet,"" said Hiroshi Kawai, a former high school classmate who still lives in Suga's hometown of Yuzawa and works as a local tour guide. ""He was someone you wouldn't notice if he was there or not.""
Suga left town soon after finishing high school and worked in a cardboard factory in Tokyo to save money for university. After graduation, he worked as a secretary for a prominent national lawmaker from Yokohama, home to Japan's busiest port.
    During his time in local politics, Suga pushed an ambitious project to redevelop Yokohama's waterfront, according to Isao Mori, an author who published Suga's biography in 2016. In the eight years he spent in the city assembly, Suga rose to be known as Yokohama's ""shadow mayor,"" Mori said.
'ACTOR ON A STAGE' 
Suga has said he begins most days at 5 a.m., checking the news before doing 100 sit-ups and taking a 40-minute walk. Even among staffers used to the grueling schedules of politicians, he was seen as an outlier for his relentless work ethic. 
Daisuke Yusa first met Suga in 2004 when he was working as a salesman for a garbage company. Suga soon recruited him to work as his secretary. 
""He used to say, think of yourself as an actor on a stage and think objectively about what position you're in now,"" Yusa said, when asked about perceptions that Suga is more of a lieutenant than a leader.
Yusa, now a local politician, said Suga always emphasized the importance of doing one's best no matter what the job.
""I think he's been able to remain in such a position without school ties or political faction because he doesn't try to stand out,"" he said.
Under Abe's first administration in 2006, Suga headed the ministry of internal affairs where he introduced a hometown tax program, offering tax deductions for those who donate money to local municipalities. 
Matsushige Ono, who served as a vice minister under Suga, said the program met fierce resistance from some bureaucrats, who opposed introducing a novel tax scheme without precedent.
""He continued to make his case because he saw how this would help rural communities,"" Ono said.
NAVIGATING BUREAUCRACY
When Abe regained the premiership at the end of 2012, he again tapped Suga.
In 2016, facing an ever-stronger yen, Suga created a framework for joint Bank of Japan, finance ministry and banking regulator meetings to signal to investors Tokyo's alarm over spikes in the yen.
Officials had wanted to create such a framework for years, but friction between ministries prevented it from being implemented.
Mitsumaru Kumagai, chief economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research who frequently speaks to Suga, said Suga has been particularly adept at navigating Japan's complex bureaucracy. 
""He is aware of who and where the key person is in any ministry and he understands how to move organisations by instructing that person,"" Kumagai said.
This year, support for the administration went into freefall as the coronavirus pandemic battered an already slowing economy. When Abe's health began to visibly falter, speculation grew over Suga's ambitions.
Shinohara, who joined the August dinner between Suga and Nikai, said the two men had bonded over their similar backgrounds.
""There are a lot of politicians now who can give good speeches and others from bureaucracies who can manage policy, but he's the kind of professional politician who has his own distinct smell,"" he said.

After dinner, the men left the hotel separately as journalists snapped pictures. A day later, Suga was asked on a TV programme whether he was interested in running for the prime minister's job. Laughing, he said: ""Not at all.""

1303,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 06:27PM ET</span>",Brazil Hits 4 Million Covid Cases While Life Gets Back to Normal,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazil reached the mark of 4 million confirmed coronavirus cases, doubling the infection count in two months as large parts of the Latin American nation emerge from isolation.
The country reported 43,773 new cases on Thursday, pushing the toll to 4,041,638. Deaths rose by 834 to 124,614, according to data from the Health Ministry. Globally, the nation lags only the U.S. in both cases and deaths from the disease, though India is fast closing in when it comes to infections. On a per capita basis, though, Brazil recently passed the U.S. and Chile for most deaths per million people and is primed to overtake Italy for the 5th spot globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Brazil has been adding about a million cases a month -- in mid-July, it had 2 million confirmed infections -- as the virus hits areas of the country that were spared earlier in the pandemic. But the pace of new infections appears to have slowed since mid-August. After four weeks with over new 300,000 cases, figures for the past two weeks have been closer to 265,000. The number of weekly deaths fell to below 6,500, the lowest since May.
The rich Southeast region of the country, home to highly-populated states like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, continues to be the hardest hit region, with more than 1.4 million cases, followed by the Northeast with 1.1 million. The North of the country, largely blanketed by the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rain forest and where hospital beds are scarce, has the highest mortality rate in the nation: 73.5 per 100,000 inhabitants, more than double the rate seen in the more developed South.
Brazil’s response to the pandemic -- no national approach, a shortage of testing and a push to reopen before the disease receded -- turned the country into a global hotspot.
President Jair Bolsonaro pushed the scientifically-unproven drug hydroxychloroquine as a solution to the outbreak and criticized severe lockdown measures implemented by governors. Contradicting policies made predicting when the infection rates would recede even more difficult than it already was in a country of 210 million people where some states are the size of France and where many live in poverty and can’t afford not to work.
Researchers from the PUC University in Rio say the virus’s reproductive rate rose to 1.01 after more than a month of decline, though it varies wildly across the country. It’s below 1 in 20 states and the Federal District, and above 1.5 in Santa Catarina, which was largely spared early on in the pandemic but has seen cases spike to over 180,000 from 87,000 in the past month.
The group forecasts cases will top 4.55 million by mid-September, with deaths reaching 136,000.
The pandemic brought on the largest economic slump on record, a 11.4% decline in the second quarter from a year ago. But Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said last week that its internal data indicates there was a strong rebound in Brazil’s economic activity. The bounce was so significant that BofA says growth as measured by the central bank’s economic activity index, or IBC-Br, may have returned to pre-Covid levels as social isolation measures wane and mobility indicators continue to rise.
Over recent weeks, local media have repeatedly shown pictures of packed beaches and parks, and crowds gathered at recently reopened bars and restaurants. The state of Sao Paulo, which has been the epicenter in the country since the first reported case in late February, has seen isolation rates fall to around 40%, from as high as 60% back in March.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is warning that Russia is trying to undermine Americans' confidence in the security and validity of mail-in voting.
In a bulletin labelled ""For official use only"" circulated on Thursday, the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis said Russia was ""likely to continue amplifying criticism of vote by mail and shifting voting processes amidst the COVID-19 pandemic to undermine public trust in the electoral process.""
The bulletin said that in mid-August, Russian state media outlets and proxy websites published criticism of widespread mail-in voting, ""claiming ineligible voters could receive ballots due to out-of-date voter rolls, leaving a vast amount of ballots unaccounted for and vulnerable to tampering."" 
It said that since March, Russian outlets also sought to undermine confidence in mail-in voting processes, alleging that they provide ""vast opportunities for voter fraud."" 
The bulletin said Russia is likely to step up trolling by promoting allegations of U.S. election system corruption, failures and ""foreign malign interference"" to undermine public trust in U.S. elections. It noted that following the Iowa caucuses earlier this year, Russian outlets claimed that the result was ""fixed in favor of establishment candidates"" and that voting system problems had resulted in ""ballot manipulation."" 
The Department of Homeland Security had no immediate comment. Russia has denied interfering in U.S. elections.
Adam Schiff, the Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said the bulletin validated his concern that Russia is seeking to ""sow distrust in our democratic process."" 
By attacking U.S. mail-in ballot integrity, Schiff said, ""Russia is echoing destructive and false narratives around vote by mail that President Trump and his enablers, including Attorney General (William) Barr, have been aggressively promoting."" 

Trump has repeatedly criticized mail-in voting, saying in one July 30 Tweet: ""With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history.""

1305,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 06:16PM ET</span>","Seven police officers in Rochester, NY suspended over Black man's death, mayor says","By Gabriella Borter and Jonathan Allen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Seven police officers were suspended Thursday over the arrest and asphyxiation death of Black man Daniel Prude in Rochester, New York after video of the March incident was released, the city's mayor said, calling it an act of racism.
Prude's family this week released body camera footage from his arrest, showing a group of officers putting a hood over his head - apparently to prevent his spit from possibly transmitting the novel coronavirus - as he knelt on the ground, handcuffed and naked. 
Prude's family has called for the arrest of the officers involved in his death seven days after the incident on March 23 in the upstate New York city. Prude was 41.
The Monroe County medical examiner ruled Prude’s death a homicide caused by ""complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint,"" according to an autopsy report, the New York Times reported. 
The autopsy report said “excited delirium” and acute intoxication by phencyclidine, or the drug PCP, were also contributing factors to his death, the Times reported.
""Mr. Daniel Prude was failed by our police department, our mental health care system, our society, and he was failed by me,"" Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren, who is Black, told reporters. ""I'm filled with grief, and anger at myself for all the failures that lead to his death.""
Warren, who said she was not made aware of the circumstances of Prude's death until August, condemned the death as an act of racism.
""Institutional and structural racism led to Daniel Prude's death. I won't deny it, I stand before it, and I call for justice upon it,"" Warren said.
Prude's asphyxiation occurred two months before the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, which spurred international protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the United States.
Prude's family obtained body camera footage after filing a freedom of information act request, CBS-affiliate WROC-TV reported. 
Rochester police chief La'Ron Singletary, who is Black, told reporters on Wednesday that internal and criminal investigations were underway.
Rochester police declined further comment on Thursday, and a lawyer for Prude's family did not respond to a request for comment.
The office of New York Attorney General Letitia James is investigating, as state law requires whenever police are involved in a civilian's death. 
'YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL ME'
In the video, an officer placed a ""spit hood"" over Prude's head. Prude could be heard shouting, ""Take this...off my face!"" and ""You're trying to kill me!"" before his shouts turned to cries and became muffled. Officers were heard saying ""Calm down"" and ""stop spitting.""
Later, the video showed an officer kneeling on Prude's back while Prude was silent and snow fell around them. Someone was heard saying, ""start CPR."" Minutes later, the video showed Prude being loaded into an ambulance on a stretcher.
Activists were planning protests in Rochester and New York City's Times Square on Thursday calling for the officers to be charged. 
Protests broke out on Wednesday in downtown Rochester, a city near Lake Ontario about 300 miles (480 km) north of New York City. Police released pepper spray on the demonstrators and arrested nine people, the Democrat and Chronicle reported. 
Mayor Warren said she was joined by City Council in calling for the charges against the protesters to be dropped on Thursday.
Prude's family told reporters that Prude had been struggling with mental health. His brother, Joe Prude, said he had called police because he was worried when his brother left home that night.

""I placed a phone call for my brother to get help, not for my brother to get lynched,"" Joe Prude said.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas held a rare meeting with rival factions on Thursday as they sought to present a united front over Israel and the United Arab Emirates' deal to normalise ties.
The meeting was held through video-conference between Ramallah in the West Bank and Beirut, where Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh and Islamic Jihad Secretary General Ziyad al-Nakhalah attended.
It is rare for Islamist Hamas and Abbas’s secular Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization to have such high-level contacts after years of in-fighting.
Palestinians were dismayed by the Gulf state’s ‘normalisation’ accord with Israel, seeing it as a betrayal likely to weaken a long-standing pan-Arab position that calls for Israel to withdraw from occupied territory. The deal was brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump, 
Abbas has refused to deal with Trump's administration for more than two years, accusing it of pro-Israel bias, and rejected Trump's Mideast plan, unveiled in January.
""Our meeting comes at a very dangerous stage, in which our national cause faces various plots and dangers,"" Abbas said on Thursday. 
""In order to stand together in the trench of confrontation and peaceful popular resistance to the occupation, I invite you here to agree on the formation of a national leadership.""
Speaking from the fortified Palestinian embassy in Beirut, Haniyeh also said it was important to have a unified strategy.
“We must succeed in ending the division and building a unified Palestinian position,” he said. “At this stage, failure is forbidden.” 

Senior U.S. and Israeli officials visited Abu Dhabi on Monday on a historic trip to cement the UAE accord. Trump adviser Jared Kushner told Palestinians they should accept the deal, restart negotiations with Israel and not be “stuck in the past.”

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 04:01PM ET</span>",'My life's work': Venezuelan union leader vows to defend workers after pardon,"By Angus Berwick and Maria Ramirez
LA PICA, Venezuela (Reuters) - One of Venezuela's most influential union leaders has vowed to press on with his fight for workers' rights after his release this week from two years of detention in a military prison on what he calls trumped up charges.
Soldiers detained Ruben Gonzalez, one of 110 people pardoned on Monday by President Nicolas Maduro, in 2018 after he led a protest to demand the Socialist leader defend Venezuela's once-potent steel industry.
A military court sentenced him to almost six years in prison for attacking an army outpost and insulting the armed forces, leading the United Nations to call for his release.
Granted his freedom Tuesday, the 61-year-old, dressed in a blue and white shirt from his steel workers union, was met by his daughter, Yarudid, at the gates of La Pica prison.
In a phone interview from his home in Puerto Ordaz, in the southeastern state of Guayana, Gonzalez said he did not consider himself pardoned, but ""freed from a kidnapping because I did not commit any crime.""
After returning to his wife, their four children and 13 grandchildren, Gonzalez vowed to continue as head of the Sintraferrominera union to ""keep defending the just cause of the workers.""
The mass pardon came as Maduro seeks to encourage the opposition to participate in parliamentary elections scheduled for early December, despite concerns the vote may not be free and fair.
Top government officials have claimed the pardons will quiet down opposition voices. But Gonzalez was adamant that his regained freedom did not mean holding back from criticizing what he decries as the state's abandonment of workers.
Having had little contact with the outside world in prison, Gonzalez said he was shocked to find out that his workers now earn even less than when he was jailed, unable to afford a chicken or a carton of eggs with a month's pay. 
""I have a responsibility to carry their message and their struggle,"" he said. ""That is my life's work.""
Gonzalez once backed Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez. But he went on to become a strident critic of the government, which he blames for allowing corrupt officials to pillage Venezuela's resources and betraying its promise to empower workers.
Late last year, Reuters visited Gonzalez in La Pica prison, outside the northeastern city of Maturin. He was the only civilian jailed there - a sign, he said, of how the government wanted to make an example of him.
""I represent the truth,"" he said at the time, sitting at a plastic table outside his cell. ""God will judge those that put me here.""
Born in 1959 to a poor family in the coastal city of Barcelona, Gonzalez was a rebellious teenager, causing his father to kick him out. After drifting, he ended up in Guayana, the site of much of Venezuela's natural wealth.
He found work at Ferrominera, the state-owned iron ore producer, and began helping his fellow workers by organizing union activities. 
In 1998, Chavez won a presidential election by a landslide, pledging to help the poor, and Gonzalez supported him. He was later elected as a local counselor for Chavez's socialist party, but the former army lieutenant colonel soon chafed against the unions as he asserted his control. 
Gonzalez became head of Sintraferrominera in 2008 and called protests to demand Chavez agree to new pay terms. He was jailed for two years on charges of conspiring to ""sabotage"" Ferrominera.
""Chavez turned on me,"" Gonzalez said.
""ALL I DO""
Maduro took over in 2013 after Chavez's death. Global oil prices sank, pushing the economy into recession: investment in Ferrominera dried up and the mines began to close. Hyperinflation eroded salaries, leaving workers earning the equivalent of just a few dollars a month.
Gonzalez again took the government to task.
On Aug 13, 2018, he tried to enter a mine to present demands to executives, but guards barred him, Gonzalez said. Soldiers ordered him to go their command post for questioning, according to a National Guard report, but he drove home.
When officers tried to enter his house, the National Guard said Gonzalez's friends and relatives hit and insulted them. Gonzalez, along with his family and lawyers, deny this, though they acknowledge he refused to go with them.
He escaped and went into hiding. Two months passed and he thought authorities' attention on him had dissipated. On Nov. 27, he traveled to Caracas to lead a march for improved contracts. Returning to Guayana, his bus was halted at a National Guard checkpoint and soldiers arrested him.
A day later, a court in Maturin ordered his imprisonment. 

""I don't stand for the opposition or the government,"" he told the judge, according to the ruling. ""All I do is protect workers' rights.""

Local officials said families were creating clandestine graveyards or sneaking into the cemeteries of the capital, La Paz, in early morning or overnight hours to dig unofficial graves for their relatives. 
""They want to bury on top of other graves. For example, they uncover the grave and want to put the body a metre (3 feet) deep, not even 2 or 3 metres,"" said Omar Arce, president of a local council, adding that police were forced to move the bodies later. 
Bolivia, which has one of the highest regional rates of extreme poverty, has struggled to free itself from the weight of the pandemic as political tensions simmer ahead of a general election.
Government officials said in August that cases accelerated among the population of 11.6 million after protests linked to the postponement of the election until Oct. 18 due to the spread of the virus.
Cemeteries in La Paz are now struggling to accommodate a 580% increase in demand for new burials, according to Rene Sahonero, a Health Ministry official.
Dealing with the clandestine graves is a heartbreaking dilemma for local authorities, who said many families had no other options for giving their loved ones a proper burial. 
""Seeing the pain of the family, we cannot prevent the burial,"" said police officer Rene Tambo, adding that police do not typically launch criminal investigations. ""We have to think about what is within people's reach. We can't force them to go to a cemetery."" 
Bolivia has 117,926 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with an official death toll of 5,200, although critics have argued that the government is underreporting deaths.
""Since the beginning of the pandemic to today, there has been an excess in the number of deaths (in comparison with official statistics),"" said public policy expert Andres Uzin.
With little more than 2,500 coronavirus tests daily, according to Uzin, the official numbers do not paint a full picture. He said an excess of more than 14,000 deaths had been registered by the Civil Registry Service.

""The government's record is not reflecting the reality of the country,"" Uzin said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mayors of major U.S. cities on Thursday blasted President Donald Trump's threat to cut federal funding to cities facing ongoing protests as a violation of the U.S. Constitution, and New York state said it would challenge any move to defund the city in court.
Trump on Wednesday instructed Attorney General William Barr to develop a list of ""anarchist jurisdictions"" that ""permitted violence and the destruction of property ... and have refused to undertake reasonable measures"" to restore order.
The U.S. Conference of Mayors said the order had no legal standing, and would make cities less safe by slashing resources for police and first responders.
""This effort is intended only to inflame tensions and divide us. It is without merit, and it would hurt the people that a president is entrusted to protect,” said the group's CEO Tom Cochran.
The mayors of Washington, Portland, Seattle and New York City - who were singled out in the Trump memo - condemned the action.
“We are confronting unprecedented challenges — fighting back a pandemic and economic devastation without another stimulus. Now, instead of leadership from the White House, we are faced with new attacks that are unlawful, unconstitutional and will be undoubtedly defeated in court,"" they wrote in a joint statement.
New York City was ready to take immediate legal action if the White House attempts to defund the city, Attorney General Letitia James said in a Thursday statement.
""The president is not a dictator and his efforts at tyrannical rule will be met with fierce opposition,"" she said.
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany shot back moments later during a briefing: ""She's free to do that. We believe that what we will do will be lawful.""
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer on Twitter called it a ""foolish stunt"" and said the president ""ought to be focused on getting our country out of the COVID crisis.""
In May, a federal appeals court blocked Trump's attempt to defund ""sanctuary cities.""

In that case, the judge ruled that the issues were a matter of state discretion. Policing and law enforcement are also areas regulated by states and local jurisdictions, not the federal government.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko promoted hardline loyalists to top posts in his security apparatus on Thursday in an effort to strengthen his grip on the former Soviet republic after weeks of mass protests and strikes.
Lukashenko, facing the biggest challenge to his 26-year rule, accompanied the reshuffle with instructions to act tough in the face of what he has repeatedly alleged is foreign aggression ahead of talks with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and a Russian government delegation. 
""The country is working, although many, especially our neighbors, would like us to collapse,"" Lukashenko said, referring to the European Union states bordering Belarus. 
Retaining the loyalty of the security forces, who have helped him crack down hard on dissent, is vital to Lukashenko as he tries to crush protests that show no sign of abating after nearly four weeks.
The reshuffle included the appointment of a new security council chief, a new head of the KGB security service and the promotion of the mayor of Minsk to the post of deputy prime minister. 
The political crisis in Belarus erupted after a presidential election on Aug. 9 which protesters say he massively rigged to ensure a phoney landslide win. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the opposition candidate was the real winner, they say. Thousands of people have repeatedly taken to the streets. 
Belarus is a close ally of Moscow, which sees it as a vital strategic buffer between Russia and NATO. President Vladimir Putin has said the Kremlin had set up a reserve police force at Lukashenko's request but it would be deployed only if necessary.
During talks with his Belarusian counterpart in Minsk, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said it was paramount to ""completely eliminate external interference in the internal political processes of Belarus"".
Lukashenko has provided no evidence that foreign powers are behind the protests. The opposition has denied this, and NATO has also denied his allegations that it is massing forces near the Belarusian border.
ARRESTS
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have imposed travel bans on Lukashenko and 29 other Belarusian officials whom they have accused of having a role in vote-rigging and in violence against protesters since the election. Belarus has pledged to retaliate.
Human rights experts from the United Nations said this week they had received reports of hundreds of cases of torture, beatings and mistreatment of Belarusian protesters by police.
The government has denied abusing detainees and has said its security forces have acted appropriately against demonstrators. 
Two former TV presenters were arrested in the capital Minsk on Wednesday night, relatives and local media said. 
Broadcaster Euroradio said Denis Dudinsky was detained near his house by uniformed officers who dragged him into a black minibus. 
A second former TV anchor, Dmitry Kokhno, was also arrested and driven away, according to his wife Nadezhda.
""I thank God our son didn't see it (the arrest),"" she said, alongside a black and white photo of her husband with the boy.
Both Dudinsky and Kokhno were sentenced to spend 10 days in jail for having taken part in unauthorized protests. 

Siarhei Dyleuski and Olga Kovalkova, two members of an opposition council, were also jailed for another 15 days following a 10-day jail stint for having disobeyed an order by the authorities.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top diplomat called on Thursday for Washington to reverse its sanctions on International Criminal Court prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and another member of the ICC, calling the measures ""unacceptable and unprecedented"".
The United States blacklisted Bensouda on Wednesday over her investigation into whether American forces committed war crimes in Afghanistan, under sanctions authorised by President Donald Trump in June that allow for asset freezes and travel bans.
Sanctions were also imposed on Phakiso Mochochoko, the head of the Hague-based ICC Jurisdiction, Complementarity and Cooperation Division.
""The sanctions ... are unacceptable and unprecedented measures that attempt to obstruct the court's investigations and judicial proceedings,"" Josep Borrell said in a statement. Washington should ""reconsider its position and reverse the measures it has taken"", he said.
The U.S. sanctions reflect the Trump administration's view that the tribunal threatens to infringe on U.S. national sovereignty. They are the latest move by Washington to go against the stance of long-standing European allies, which have largely supported American policy and whose trade and security ties are intertwined with the United States.

Fathi Bashagha said in a statement posted online that he had been reinstated after a five-hour hearing about the protests and the role of the security forces. 
An influential figure from the port city and military power base of Misrata, Bashagha is well regarded by the GNA's foreign backers and played a central role as it repelled a 14-month assault on Tripoli by eastern-based forces. 
However, there have been longstanding tensions between armed groups from Tripoli and Misrata, and friction was reported recently between Bashagha and GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj.
Armed groups in Tripoli had used gunfire to disperse protesters. Bashagha's interior ministry said it would protect the protesters. 
Bashagha, who was visiting the GNA's main ally Turkey when he was suspended, was met on his return by his supporters and a convoy of military vehicles from Misrata. 
The protests, including some attended by hundreds of people, have focused on a worsening electricity crisis with blackouts lasting for much of the day even after the assault on Tripoli ended in June. 

The unrest coincides with a surging coronavirus outbreak in Libya and Serraj's declaration of a full lockdown to limit its spread was seen by critics as a means of curbing the protests.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Parents, teachers and students nationwide are preparing for a school year like no other. As part of our #AskReuters Twitter chat series, Reuters gathered a group of experts to discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed K-12 education. 
Below are edited highlights.
How can parents, students and teachers prepare for the coming school year?
“Slow things down! Take your expectations of what’s possible in classrooms and cut them in half. Generally, teachers haven’t been given nearly enough time to reconfigure their teaching practices. Give them some slack. Zoom fatigue is real.” 
— Antero Garcia, assistant professor at Stanford University
“Being prepared means being flexible. Schools will likely have to open and close based on transmission rates in their communities and cases in schools.” 
— John Bailey, visiting Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute 
How will learning in 2020-2021 academic year look different, now that we’ve had a few months to plan? 
“We hope to see districts adapt and improve quickly. There are a lot of thoughtful and creative reopening plans. Over the next few weeks, we will be highlighting promising approaches to address both health and learning needs, whether in person or remote.”
— Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education 
“One of the questions of this school year is: Will remote instruction be improved? District officials say yes, but still many kids don't have what they need tech-wise and much time this summer was spent working on health and safety, not instruction.”
— Matt Barnum, education policy reporter at Chalkbeat 
Are there ways to replicate the social, emotional and non-academic experiences children get in school if they are not physically in the classroom?
“That is the hardest part for both K-12 and higher ed. Youth life is gradually resuming in places where the virus rates are low enough - distanced soccer and the rest. We need to get kids together physically at a distance to do some of these things.” 
— Jal Mehta, professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education
Can you talk about the technology gap, and how it is impacting learning? What resources are available to breach the digital divide?
“Far too many students are being left behind from distance learning as they lack internet access at home and a dependable device. Many teachers also lack the connectivity they need to deliver remote instruction and support student learning.” 
— National Parent Teachers Association
“From a culturally responsive-sustaining perspective, we see that young people access tech in ways that are not fully clear to those who design education - through video games, cellphones, and other digital devices that could also be used to curate a learning experience.” 
— David E. Kirkland, executive director at The NYU Metropolitan Center for Research on Equity and The Transformation of Schools
How is the pandemic impacting children with special needs? What advice do you have to help kids with developmental challenges learn now?
“Communication will be key. Parents need to understand what schools are doing to provide their children with the needed interventions, related services and accommodations. And educators will need to check-in with parents to see what's working.” 
— Laura Schifter, lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education
Disruption can lead to transformation. How will education change, post-COVID?
“Frankly, we will have failed our children if this next decade isn’t transformational. We can't wait any longer to take on the major systemic problems holding kids back. Now is the time to build a world grounded in the real needs and aspirations of all students.” 
— Teach For America 
“The transformation of education will be shaped by how we perceive the disruption. Education is always evolving and opportune. This is an opportunity to increase attention to inequity in education and the critical social and emotional needs of students ahead.”
— Rebecca Kullback, co-founder of LaunchWell and Metropolitan Counseling Associates

LONDON (Reuters) - The former first-daughter of Angola Irene Neto has denied any wrongdoing by her husband, a top figure in the oil industry who is the focus of a Swiss money-laundering probe and subject to one of the largest personal asset freezes in Swiss history.
Prosecutors say Carlos Manuel de São Vicente's monopoly over insurance and re-insurance for state oil giant Sonangol from 2000 to 2016 culminated in huge bank transfers into accounts in his own name, his companies, wife and family members, according to court documents seen by Reuters.
The Geneva-based law firm representing De São Vicente has told Reuters he refutes the charges and had always acted according to the law.
His wife, Neto, reinforced that denial in a statement to Reuters via the political foundation she heads. 
Neto is the daughter of the Angola's first president from 1975 to 1979, Agostinho Neto, and was herself a former deputy minister from Angola's ruling MPLA party. She is not accused of any wrongdoing as part of the probe.
""Any allegation of a possible link between her late father's position and her husband's activities is defamatory,"" the statement said.
""Mrs. Neto stresses that her husband at all times and in any circumstances conducted his business according to the law and has no doubt that justice will prove so.""
Angola is seeking to tackle a legacy of alleged corruption which has dogged the nation as it seeks to attract foreign investment into its struggling economy.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Pressure mounted on German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday to reconsider the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will take gas from Russia to Germany, after she said Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny had been poisoned with a Soviet-style nerve agent.
Merkel said on Wednesday that Navalny, who is being treated in a Berlin hospital, was the victim of a murder attempt using the nerve agent Novichok, and demanded an explanation by Russia. 
Moscow has denied involvement and said the West should not leap to hasty conclusions.
Western countries have condemned the attack and many German politicians want a tough response.
""We must pursue hard politics, we must respond with the only language (Russian President Vladimir) Putin understands - that is gas sales,"" Norbert Roettgen, the conservative head of Germany's parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said on Thursday.
Late on Wednesday he had said completion of Nord Stream 2 ""would be the maximum confirmation and encouragement for Putin to continue this kind of politics"".
Nord Stream 2 will double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany. 
Led by Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) with Western partners, the project is more than 90% completed and scheduled to operate from early 2021, which could make it hard to stop.
The project has split the European Union, with some members saying it will undermine the traditional gas transit state, Ukraine and increase the bloc's energy reliance on Russia. 
The United States, keen to increase liquefied natural gas (LNG) sales to Europe, also opposes the pipeline and has targeted some companies involved with sanctions. 
It is not clear Merkel, who has been unwavering in her support for the project, will bow to pressure. 
Showing she was in no hurry to act, she said on Thursday any response depended on Russia's behaviour.
She said last week the Navalny case should not be linked to the pipeline, which is backed by Uniper, Wintershall DEA, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), Engie and OMV. 
Many in Merkel's pro-business conservative party want it to be finished. 
A spokesman for Uniper, which has said it will lend up to 950 million euros to the project, said 2,300 km of the 2,460 km of the twin pipelines that make up Nord Stream 2 had been laid and Europe needed them.
""The pipeline and LNG infrastructure are both urgently needed to ensure secure, flexible and low-cost gas supply in Europe in the future,"" he said.
Former Social Democrat (SPD) Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a friend of Putin and lobbyist for Russian energy firms, has been involved with the pipeline. 
Many in the SPD, which shares power with Merkel's conservatives, also back it but the head of the SPD parliamentary party said all options must be considered.
Prominent security analysts are also making the case for a tough stance.

""If we want to send a clear message to Moscow with our partners, then economic relations must be on the agenda and that means the Nord Stream 2 project must not be left out,"" Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference and a former ambassador to Washington, said.

Bulgarians have been rallying daily, largely peacefully, since early July, demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and Chief Prosecutor Ivan Geshev, accusing them of failing to combat high-level corruption.
""After last night's excesses we will not resign,"" senior GERB party member Toma Bikov told the parliament. 
""If we do that it would mean that any next government could be brought down by people from the criminal world,"" he said.
Protesters accuse three-times premier Borissov, 61, of weakening state institutions to the benefit of powerful tycoons, keeping Bulgaria the European Union's poorest country.
On Wednesday, about 200 protesters and police officers were injured in clashes at which some demonstrators threw small bombs and firecrackers at heavily-protected police officers who cordoned off the square around the parliament and dispersed the rally.
Earlier in the day demonstrators hurled eggs, apples and garbage at officers and shook police vehicles in front of the parliament. Police used pepper spray and said some of the protesters had also used an unknown gas substance against them.
Some 126 people were arrested, half of whom had criminal records, the head of the Sofia police said, adding 80 police officers were injured. 
Some protesters accused police of failing to properly protect the rally and allowing football hooligans to mix among the crowd. Protesters blamed the hooligans for the small bombs.
Human rights group Bulgarian Helsinki Committee said it had received numerous complaints that police officers had used unwarranted force against peaceful protesters, including a journalist, who had identified himself as such.

The European Commission commented on the protests, saying that any use of force by authorities against protesters must only be proportionate and democratic countries must ensure the right to peaceful demonstrations.

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 12:26PM ET</span>",Transportation chief says aid needed by November to avoid big NYC subway and bus cuts,"By Axel Threlfall
(Reuters) - New York's coronavirus-hit Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) will have to start implementing a dramatic job and service reduction plan in November if it does not receive billions of dollars in federal aid, the agency's chairman said on Thursday.
Speaking in a virtual Reuters Newsmaker event, Patrick Foye said the MTA's upcoming board meeting in November was the cutoff date for pulling the trigger on a plan to lay off 8,400 workers and cut city subway and bus service by up to 40 percent. 
""That is the point at which we would have to begin implementing the service reductions and layoffs,"" Foye said, adding that the MTA would also shelve a $51.5 billion capital plan to fix and upgrade North America's biggest transportation system.
""If we are not able to make those investments, there will be a deterioration in service, as occurred in New York City in the '70s and '80s, and we don't want to go back there,"" Foye said.
Foye and John Samuelsen, international president of the Transport Workers Union of America, warned in an opinion article this week in the New York Times that the MTA faced a ""five-alarm fire"" and called on the U.S. Senate to approve funds to save it.
In July, the MTA unveiled a four-year financial plan that estimated a $16.2 billion deficit by 2024, with more than a third of those losses coming next year, a signal that it does not see ridership, hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic, rebounding significantly anytime soon.
The agency, which runs New York City buses and subways and two commuter railroads that connect the city with suburbs, is losing $200 million in revenue a week and estimates it needs another $3.9 billion in federal aid to get through the end of this year and a total of $10.3 billion through 2021.
In addition to the plunge in revenue, the MTA has had to spend more to clean subway cars, stations and buses to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Subway service, which formerly ran for 24 hours, was closed down from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. to make that cleaning possible, another hit to ridership. 
Even with congressional negotiations on further federal assistance at a standstill, Foye said he still held out hope that the Republican-controlled Senate would approve additional funding for the MTA before the Nov. 3 national election.
""If reason prevails and the national interest is pursued by the Senate, the Republican leadership in the Senate and Washington, the MTA will be financed,"" Foye said.
Foye said he was not optimistic there would be any progress this year on congestion pricing, a program that charges vehicles entering Manhattan a fee. The program was supposed to account for $15 billion of the MTA's capital spending plan, but its rollout has been slowed by the federal government not determining what environmental review is needed.
Foye described the withholding of aid from the MTA and the New York City region as a ""punitive"" act by Washington, echoing concerns by cities and states run by Democrats that they are being targeted by Republican President Donald Trump.
Foye suggested that the election of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who has been a frequent rider on Amtrak passenger trains and a supporter of public transportation, might lead to better outcomes for the MTA.

""I believe that he's got a different view of the importance of mass transit and public transit,"" Foye said.

Army engineers were ""dealing with it,"" according to an army statement carried by the state news agency NNA. The statement said the chemicals were found outside entrance nine to the port.
The catastrophic explosion on Aug. 4 that ripped through the city killed about 190 people. The authorities said it was caused by about 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stacked in unsafe conditions in a port warehouse for years.
The blast smashed entire neighbourhoods, gutting buildings and injuring 6,000 people.
Lebanon's government quit amid public anger in a nation already brought to its knees by an economic crisis. The public remains anxious that more hazardous materials are being stored badly, putting them at risk.
Earlier on Thursday, President Michel Aoun ordered repairs to be made to old refuelling infrastructure at Beirut airport and called for an investigation into a report that thousands of litres of fuel had leaked from the system. 
Beirut airport head Fadi el-Hassan told a news conference that a leak of 84,000 litres of fuel had occurred in March 2019 and repairs were completed in two months. He said international investigators had described the repairs as ""satisfactory"".
News of the leak added to concerns about public safety. ""No explosion is awaiting us,"" Hassan told the news conference.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Relatives of at least 259 jailed Venezuelan police and military officers are clamoring for their release, upset that none of them were included on the list of 110 people pardoned by President Nicolas Maduro's government this week. 
Maduro's government on Monday pardoned the opposition politicians and activists, several of whom were jailed, months ahead of a parliamentary election scheduled for Dec. 6. 
Major opposition parties pledged to boycott the vote, arguing it will be rigged in favor of Maduro's socialist party, though two opposition leaders have opened talks with the government to participate.
But none of the uniformed prisoners - many of whom are charged with conspiring to oust Maduro or his predecessor and mentor, the late Hugo Chavez - were among those pardoned. 
""They use political prisoners at their convenience,"" said Andreina Baduel, the daughter of retired general and former defense minister Raul Baduel, who remains behind bars.
Baduel was arrested in 2009 on corruption charges and released in 2017 but was immediately arrested again for allegedly conspiring against Maduro. He has not yet been tried on the second accusation, and his lawyers have been unable to access his case file, his daughter said. 
""He is in limbo,"" she said. 
Excluding police and military officers from the list of those pardoned shows Venezuela's government uses politically motivated and arbitrary detentions to intimidate critics and use their release as bargaining chips, said relatives interviewed by Reuters.
The U.S. State Department on Thursday said in a statement that the pardons represent only a third of the political prisoners Venezuela holds and do not address the underlying political crisis.  
""Hundreds of political prisoners remain, and like those now offered house arrest or an end (for the moment) to their criminal cases, none of these Venezuelans should ever have been imprisoned for a single day,"" the statement said.
Asked why they were not included, chief prosecutor Tarek Saab said the recommendations came from the Commission for Truth, Justice and Public Tranquility, a group comprised of Maduro allies that investigates acts of political violence. 
""We looked at the cases where it was valid to dictate this pardon,"" Saab said in a telephone interview, without elaborating. 
Esther Bolivar says she has not slept well since her son was arrested 17 years ago. Her son, police officer Erasmo Bolivar, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for allegedly wounding protesters during marches in 2002 that were part of an opposition effort to oust Chavez. 
""This problem has buried me; I want to be with my son,"" Esther Bolivar said while leaning against the wall of her apartment in the seaside town of Catia La Mar north of the capital Caracas. She keeps photos of her son, as well as trophies he won as an amateur basketball player, in the living room of her apartment. 
His lawyer, Theresly Malave, said he did not shoot at protesters, but rather was was tending to injured demonstrators. 
""These years have been full of pain,"" said Maria Bolivar, Erasmo Bolivar's aunt and an activist for uniformed prisoners. ""What does the government want by keeping these boys in jail?""

1327,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 11:25AM ET</span>","French spy master joins effort to deliver Lebanese reforms, sources say","By Tom Perry and Laila Bassam
BEIRUT (Reuters) - France's intelligence chief has joined efforts to push Lebanon to deliver a new government and reforms, Lebanese sources said on Thursday, buttressing President Emmanuel Macron's bid to pull the country out of a devastating economic crisis.
Macron is center stage in international efforts to press fractious Lebanese politicians to address a crisis seen as the biggest threat to Lebanon's stability since the 1975-1990 civil war. 
The crisis, caused by decades of corruption and mismanagement, was compounded by a huge Aug. 4 Beirut port blast that killed more than 190 people and ruined a swathe of the capital.
During his visit to Lebanon on Tuesday, Macron gave Lebanese politicians until the end of October to start delivering reform, warning they could face sanctions if corruption gets in the way.
Bernard Emie, director general of France’s external intelligence service, the Direction Generale de la Securite Exterieure (DGSE), has been in contact with Lebanese officials on the issues discussed during Macron's visit, three Lebanese officials said. 
Asked whether Emie was playing a role, the French presidency said: ""The president does the follow-up and everyone within the state does its job. The (foreign) minister will make calls."" 
Emie, the French ambassador to Lebanon from 2004 to 2007, was appointed DGSE head shortly after Macron took office in 2017. 
""He is following all the files that Macron presented in his last visit and with this purpose is in touch with many Lebanese officials across the political spectrum,"" a senior Lebanese official said. ""He is urging them to accelerate the implementation of reforms.""
Emie was appointed ambassador to Lebanon after serving as an adviser to French President Jacques Chirac. He was in the post when Lebanon's Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, a close friend of Chirac, was assassinated in 2005. 
Diplomats say he played a key role in efforts to push Syrian troops out of Lebanon. Syrian forces entered Lebanon during its civil war and remained afterwards.
Emie is among several French officials following up with Lebanese factions. Others include Emmanuel Bonne, Macron's chief diplomatic adviser and another former envoy to Beirut, the sources said.
Pressure from Macron pushed Lebanese leaders to agree on a new prime minister, Mustapha Adib, who has started talks to form a cabinet of specialist ministers.
While France, Lebanon's former colonial power, is at the forefront of diplomacy, other countries also have influence, including Iran through its support for the heavily armed Shi'ite group Hezbollah.
The United States, which lists Hezbollah as a terrorist group, is also a major donor, including to the Lebanese army.
Senior U.S. official David Schenker, on a visit to Beirut, told an-Nahar newspaper the United States appreciated the French effort but there were ""slight differences"" with Paris.
Schenker said Washington did not believe Hezbollah was a legitimate political organization and was not ""inclined to reform"". Macron described the group as an elected part of the political system.

Police said they arrested two men who operated the quadcopter that flew over Rabin Square, a site often used for street protests and political rallies.
""The time has come,"" the Green Drone pro-legalization group said on its Telegram web messaging channel. ""Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's the Green Drone sending you free cannabis from the skies.""
In a statement, police said they suspected the baggies were filled with ""a dangerous drug"" and that officers managed to recover dozens of them. Photos distributed by the police showed what appeared to be cannabis inside.
The Maariv news website, which carried photos of the drone dropping the packets, said passersby took some of them before police arrived. Footage showed people walking through busy traffic to pick up packets that had fallen on a road.
Currently, medical use of cannabis is permitted in Israel while recreational use is illegal but largely decriminalized.

In May, Israel gave approval for exports of medical cannabis, paving the way for sales abroad that the government expects to produce hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.

The European court's president, Robert Spano, began his four-day visit to Turkey with a speech on judicial independence in which he criticized the country's arrests of judges and emphasized the principal of subsidiarity, under which Turkish courts must recognize ECHR rulings. 
But he stopped short of addressing the government's treatment of some lawyers, including those on hunger strike in prison demanding fair trials. Nor did the speech mention new regulations on bar associations criticized by many lawyers. 
Last week, lawyer Ebru Timtik died in an Istanbul hospital after a 238-day hunger strike following her conviction last year for membership of a terrorist organization. 
""The speech suggests Judge Spano does not believe that Turkey has serious human rights and rule of law problems. There exist some minor problems but all of them can easily be solved by the training of young judges. Good luck!"" prominent human rights lawyer Kerem Altiparmak said on Twitter.
Spano met Erdogan and Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul and was later to receive an honorary law doctorate from Istanbul University. In his speech, Spano noted the detention and conviction of former Turkish judge Alparslan Altan. 
The ECHR in 2019 ruled Altan's detention was unlawful, but the ruling was not upheld by Turkish courts. Altan is serving an 11-year prison sentence after being convicted of membership of the network that Ankara says orchestrated a failed coup in 2016. 
Spano's visit drew criticism before he arrived.
Emma Sinclair-Webb, director of Human Rights Watch Turkey, said on Twitter it was ""astonishing to think"" Spano planned to accept a doctorate from a university that ""summarily dismissed scores of academics... in an unlawful way."" She added: ""Think again Judge Spano.""

GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - An independent panel reviewing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic will ask ""hard questions"" and has been assured of access to the records of the World Health Organization (WHO), its co-chairs said on Thursday.
Former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf named the 11 members they have selected to help prepare a final report for next May.
""This is a strong panel, poised to ask the hard questions,"" Johnson Sirleaf told a news conference. 
It will examine ""actions of WHO and their time lines pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic"" and the effectiveness of WHO's International Health Regulations, said Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
Co-chair Helen Clark said the WHO had ""made clear that their files are open book. Anything we want to see, we see.""
""We will ask with the benefit of hindsight how WHO and national governments could have worked differently,"" Clark said. ""Are there lessons to be learned in order not to repeat the experience of this pandemic?""
The COVID-19 pandemic has now caused more than 26.11 million infections and 862,963 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has strongly criticized the WHO's role in the crisis, accusing it of being too close to China and not doing enough to question Beijing's actions late last year when the virus first emerged. 
Tedros has dismissed the suggestions and said his agency has kept the world informed. 
The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it will not pay some $80 million it currently owes to the WHO and will instead redirect the money to help pay its United Nations bill in New York.
Members of the new panel include former Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo; ex-British foreign secretary David Miliband; Chinese professor Zhong Nanshan; Canada's Joanne Liu, a former head of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders); and American Mark Dybul and France's Michel Kazatchkine, who each formerly headed the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.
The panel is scheduled to meet for the first time on Sept. 17, the co-chairs said.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus said when announcing the launch of the panel in July that it would provide an interim report to an annual meeting of health ministers resuming in November and present a ""substantive report"" next May.
Tedros said that the review was in line with a resolution adopted by its 194 member countries last May calling for an evaluation.

MOSCOW/BERLIN (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday the West should not rush to judge it over the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and that there were no grounds to accuse it of the crime, as talk in the West of punishing Moscow intensified. 
The Kremlin was speaking a day after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Navalny had been poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent in an attempt to murder him and that she would consult NATO allies about how to respond.
Navalny, 44, is an outspoken opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has specialized in high-impact investigations into official corruption. He was airlifted to Germany last month after collapsing on a domestic Russian flight after drinking a cup of tea that his allies said was poisoned.
Berlin's Charite hospital, which is treating Navalny, has said he remains in a serious condition in an intensive care unit connected to an artificial lung ventilator even though some of his symptoms are receding.
Novichok is the same substance that Britain said was used against a Russian double agent and his daughter in an attack in England in 2018. The deadly group of nerve agents was developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow rejected any suggestion that Russia had been behind the attack on Navalny and warned other countries against jumping to conclusions without knowing the full facts.
""There are no grounds to accuse the Russian state. And we are not inclined to accept any accusations in this respect,"" Peskov told reporters.
""Of course we would not want our partners in Germany and other European countries to hurry with their assessments.""
Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia's SVR foreign intelligence agency, said Moscow could not rule out Western intelligence agencies had orchestrated the poisoning to stir up trouble, the RIA news agency reported. 
Russian prosecutors have said they see no reason to launch a criminal investigation because they say they have found no sign a crime was committed, though pre-investigation checks are continuing. 
Peskov said Russia was eager to know what had happened to Navalny, but couldn't do so without receiving information from Germany about the tests that had led to Berlin's conclusions about Novichok. 
SANCTIONS PRESSURE 
OPCW, the global chemical weapons agency, said the poisoning of any individual with a toxic nerve agent would be considered use of a banned chemical weapon.
The European Commission said the bloc could only slap new sanctions on Russia after an investigation revealed who was responsible for Navalny's poisoning. Lithuania said it would ask EU leaders to discuss the poisoning at their next summit. 
Merkel said that any German or European response would depend on whether Russia helped clear up the case.
After her strong statement on Wednesday, she is under pressure at home to reconsider the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will take gas from Russia to Germany.
""We must pursue hard politics, we must respond with the only language (Russian President Vladimir) Putin understands - that is gas sales,"" Norbert Roettgen, head of Germany's parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told German radio.
""If the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is completed now, it would be the maximum confirmation and encouragement for Putin to continue this kind of politics,"" Roettgen, a member of Merkel's conservatives, told German television separately.
Nord Stream 2 is set to double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline in carrying gas directly from Russia to Germany. Led by Russian company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) with Western partners, the project is more than 90% finished and due to operate from early 2021. This may complicate efforts to stop it.
It is fiercely opposed by Washington and has divided the European Union, with some countries warning it will undermine the traditional gas transit state, Ukraine, and increase the bloc’s reliance on Russia.
Peskov said the Kremlin regarded talk of trying to thwart Nord Stream 2 as being based on emotions. He said the project was a commercial one which benefited Russia, Germany and Europe.

""We don't understand what the reason for any sanctions could be,"" said Peskov.

Children started to return to schools this week - for many the first time they have been back in full-time education since the spread of COVID-19 forced classes to shut in March.
To prevent large gatherings, schools are staggering arrivals, keeping pupils in smaller groups, controlling where they walk in communal areas and requiring the provision of water bottles and pencil cases to prevent sharing. Desks are likely to be placed in rows so pupils do not sit in groups on a table. 
Sam French, executive principal at Harris Academy, said the staff were delighted to be back and while there have been many challenges, they wanted the school to look as normal as before.
""We've done our very best to keep (the challenges) at our level so when the children came back today, as far as possible they were coming back to the school that they left in March,"" she told Reuters, over the sound of pupils in the playground. 
Children were greeted by a teacher providing hand sanitizer when they arrived to an archway of balloons on Thursday. 
While schools kept in touch with pupils during lockdown and provided regular work, teachers will now need to use the first term to assess how many children have fallen behind, and how many have pulled ahead in their learning. 
""These first few weeks are just about finding out where the gaps are, finding out where the strengths are and then building, so that by October half-term we're all back where we need to be and we can continue with the year,"" French said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government is under pressure to ensure that schools can stay open after the long break and following a debacle over estimated exam results that affected whether some students went to university this year.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",Mexico's president nods to environment but favors state energy firms,"By David Alire Garcia
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - On the campaign trail two years ago, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged to meet Mexico's commitments on combating global warming and discussed moving the oil-producing nation away from fossil fuels with leading environmentalists, like former U.S. Vice President Al Gore.
Since taking office in late 2018, Mexico's president has promoted a major reforestation program, pledged to phase out the herbicide glyphosate, and railed against fracking.
""As a matter of conviction, we've decided to take care of the environment like no previous government has done,"" the leftist nationalist said in a major speech this week.
But, in policy terms, Lopez Obrador has prioritized the health of Mexico's state-owned energy behemoths, oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) and power firm Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE).
For instance, he has pledged a new $8 billion oil refinery in his home state of Tabasco, plus upgrades to six existing Pemex facilities. And he has sought to temporarily prevent dozens of privately-owned wind and solar plants from connecting to the national grid, saying power from them was too intermittent.
Lopez Obrador's government also postponed a rule requiring cleaner-burning diesel until after he leaves office in late 2024, arguing that Pemex lacks the infrastructure to meet it.
While his allies say Lopez Obrador's support for the energy giants will curb Mexico's dependence on foreign fuel and promote economic development, critics slam him for what they charge has been backsliding on environmental goals.
Lopez Obrador's energy agenda may have little in common with many of the environmental goals of progressive politicians in the United States or Europe, but it is a familiar strategy for leftist leaders in developing nations: targeting state-centric industrial development in a bid to tackle rampant poverty.
Manuel Rodriguez, a congressman from Lopez Obrador's Morena party, said the president's insistence on strengthening Pemex and CFE was necessary to guarantee Mexico has sufficient domestically-produced energy.
He said upwards of 70% of Mexico's gasoline is imported, mostly from U.S. refiners, due to insufficient Pemex production.
""It's a very risky situation. We're vulnerable,"" said Rodriguez, who leads the lower house's energy commission. He pointed to the possibility of supplies being disrupted by natural disasters - such as a major hurricane - or a trade embargo by the U.S. government. To date, no such major disruptions have occurred.
'MORE URGENT PROBLEMS'
Rodriguez pointed to Lopez Obrador's opposition to fracking as an example of his concern for the environment. 
Fracking - the process by which dense petroleum-rich rock is blasted open with massive amounts of water, sand, and toxic chemicals - has opened up vast deposits of oil in the United States, including in the Permian Basin which straddles Texas and New Mexico. 
Lopez Obrador has blocked efforts to launch fracking in Mexico's northern border states, such as Tamaulipas.
But for critics like Rosanety Barrios, a senior energy ministry official with Mexico's previous government, Lopez Obrador has failed to act in other ways. She highlighted that he has made no effort to force the CFE's most polluting plants to switch from highly-contaminating fuel oil to natural gas.
She said CFE's Tula plant near Mexico City could run entirely on natural gas if a local dispute over a pipeline were settled. A recent Reuters investigation showed the plant has for years busted legal contaminant limits.
""I don't think the government has any interest in resolving it,"" she said.
The CFE did not respond to a request for comment, but the head of the company has previously said he would like to move towards using natural gas in the plants.
Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor, stirred hopes that he would adopt a bold environmental vision when he met with Al Gore just a few months before his landslide election victory in 2018.
""It was great to see their profound overlap on climate action and energy transition,"" Marcelo Ebrard, who was then a senior campaign aide to Lopez Obrador and is now foreign minister, wrote in a tweet at the time.
The president appointed a well-known biologist and academic as his environment minister in 2019. But, after disputes with the cabinet, he resigned on Wednesday, citing stress and unspecified health reasons.
Historian Lorenzo Meyer said Lopez Obrador's focus on promoting economic development via the state-run energy companies makes sense politically. 
He said the president's priorities were rooted in an era when Pemex powered Mexico's development and filled government coffers. Many Mexicans view the state-run firms as sources of national pride.
Absent a rejuvenated green movement, the president's focus would remain fixed on combating poverty and corruption, he said.

""For him, those are more urgent problems.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Two prominent Thai political activists were remanded in prison on Thursday, their lawyer said, after a court ruled they had breached the terms of their bail following earlier arrests over anti-government rallies. 
Human Rights lawyer Anon Nampa, 36, and student activist Panupong Jadnok, 24 were sent to the Bangkok Remand Prison after the court said their political activities since their Aug.8 release were in breach of their bail conditions.
They were among more than a dozen anti-government demonstrators, including students and rappers, charged recently with inciting unrest and breaching regulations that ban public gatherings, after they took part in a rally on July 18.
The two were sent to pretrial detention because they declined to post bail again, arguing they had stuck to their bail conditions, said Anon's lawyer, Weeranan Huadsri.
""The court did not prevent the posting of new bail but both Anon and Panupong insisted that they did not breach the court's condition,"" Weeranan told Reuters, adding they can be held for up to 48 days. 
Both have participated in anti-government protests that have taken place almost daily in the past six weeks to demand an end to military influence over politics and the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who first came to power in a 2014 coup.
Anon is also among a number of activists that made a bold public call for reform of the country's monarchy, until recently a taboo subject in Thailand.
A student group plans a major protest on Sept. 19.
""My duty outside of prison has ended, and I wanted to gamble everything for change,"" Anon posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) before being sent to jail.

""Let my jailing today be the receipt of harassment against the people. On 19 Sept. 2020 go take it back.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - More than 100 diners craving in-flight meals after months of travel restrictions flocked to Thai Airways International Pcl's offices on Thursday to try a new pop-up restaurant and get a reminder of the forgotten flavors of on-board dining.
The national carrier, which has for months grounded most of its planes, has transformed the cafeteria of its Bangkok headquarters into an airline-themed restaurant and opened it to the public. 
""I ate a lot,"" said Pirachat Pengthongworrapetch, 36, who heard about the restaurant online. ""It's better here than in the air because it's cooked to order.""
Thailand has halted commercial flights to try to prevent coronavirus infections.
But diners can still get to meet cabin crew, who greet them in full uniform as they enter the restaurant. It is decorated with airplane parts and seats to lend it an authentic aircraft feel.
""Spare parts from engines, windows and fan blades were used as furniture,"" Thai Airways Catering Managing Director Varangkana Luerojvong told Reuters.
Each decoration has a QR code attached so visitors can look up information about the parts.
Diner Kanta Akanitprachai, 50, liked the idea of a plane meal without having to buy a flight ticket.
""I like the in-flight meals on Thai Airways, but we only get to have it when we fly,"" said Kanta. ""Today we get to have it here, that's good because we want to eat.""
Varangkana said the restaurant, which serves about 2,000 meals per day, was a way to recoup some lost revenue during the coronavirus pandemic, and there are plans to turn other Thai Airways offices into similar dining experiences.
Chefs and cabin crew from the airline, which filed for bankruptcy protection in May, appeared in good spirits. 
Japanese chef Jun Uenishi said the experience was different because it was his first time interacting with customers.

The Thai bankruptcy court will decide on Sept. 14 if the airline can go ahead with its restructuring proposals.

On Wednesday, Michel Barnier said Britain was not showing enough flexibility in engaging with the EU's demands on guarantees of fair competition, on fisheries and solving disputes, putting a deal on their future relationship at risk.
Since Britain left the bloc in January, talks on a trade agreement and other future ties have all but stalled, with each side accusing the other of failing to compromise before a transition period runs out at the end of this year.
U.S. bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said there was about a one-third chance of the two failing to agree a deal.
""Michel Barnier's comments are a misleading representation of our proposals, aimed at deflecting scrutiny from the EU's own positions, which are unrealistic, and unprecedented,"" said the spokesman.
""For our part, we have been consistently clear that we're seeking a relationship that respects our sovereignty and which has a free trade agreement at its core, similar to those the EU already agreed with like-minded countries.""

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>",Live from Pyongyang: North Korea state media tests new formats on air and online,"By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - As two typhoons hammered North Korea within a week of each other, state media broadcasts looked unusually reminiscent of international TV coverage, with correspondents standing knee-deep in floodwaters to provide rare, nearly real-time reports.
Thursday's broadcasts were the latest example of a national propaganda machine that is slowly evolving in the face of more competition from international media that seep into the isolated country, analysts said.
In unprecedented overnight broadcasts, correspondents and anchors were shown at locations around the country, shouting the latest developments while being lashed with wind and rain.
The format offered seemingly unscripted moments rarely seen on the state-controlled Korean Central Television, including one rain-drenched reporter brushing off attempts by a man trying to hand him an umbrella in the middle of a report.
""It's surprisingly fast and honest public service reporting from KCTV unlike anything we've seen before,"" said Martyn Williams (NYSE:WMB), a researcher at 38 North, a U.S.-based think-tank that monitors North Korea.
The coverage is almost certainly part of a top-down response to leader Kim Jong Un's recent call last week for more efforts to prevent damage from the typhoons, Williams added.
""The layers of censorship and approval needed are too complex to do this without pretty high-up approval,"" he said.
EVOLVING MEDIA
The coverage reflects Kim's policy of greater transparency and resolving issues head-on, rather than trying to hide them, said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former North Korea open source intelligence analyst in the U.S. government.
""Damage from natural disasters has always been a highly sensitive topic for North Korean state media, and showing near-real-time news reports from flood sites on state TV was unthinkable,"" she said.
Since the early days of Kim's rule, North Korean TV has experimented with various stylistic and formatting changes, ranging from bringing in a younger generation of TV news anchors, to showing more graphics during newscasts, to emulating South Korean entertainment shows, Lee said.
""Kim Jong Un seems to have realized early on that KCTV needed to keep up with the times to compete with the influx of South Korean and foreign media and entertainment content, and that explains KCTV modernization efforts,"" she said.
A MESSAGE FOR THE WORLD
In recent years, North Korea has dabbled in online media aimed at a more global audience as well.
Among them are a Twitter account with the handle @ColdNoodleFan - a nod to one of North Korea's most famous dishes - which described itself as ""Anti-war, peace advocate and unbiased news"" on North Korea.
According to Colin Zwirko, a reporter at Seoul-based NK News, which specializes in North Korea, the account appears to be linked to the North Korean state-run Sogwang media group, sometimes even publishing content before it appears on official outlets.
@ColdNoodleFan - which was recently suspended by Twitter for unspecified reasons and currently displays a message by the platform warning that the account has shown ""some unusual activity"" - has nearly 9,000 followers, while following zero other accounts.
An English-language YouTube channel called ""Echo of Hope"" has gained nearly 29,000 subscribers and more than 1.5 million views with videos of ""daily life"" in North Korea.
Among the channel's most popular videos are clips about a pizza restaurant in Pyongyang and smiling people at an amusement park, as well as videos about the coronavirus situation and recent floods.
A series of videos, including some under the title ""What's Up, Pyongyang?"", feature an English-speaking young woman identified as ""Un A"" touring various spot in the city.
In recent months, ""Echo of Hope"" has quietly been removing old-style videos of North Korea's former leaders, focusing instead on the newer videos that gather many more viewers, Williams found.
And North Korea's Chinese-language efforts appear to be even more successful, with 533,000 followers on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), according to Williams.

""The goals of these initiatives seem to be to saturate social media with some positive messages on North Korea, or at least make people skeptical about what they read about North Korea elsewhere,"" Zwirko said.

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>","Turkey’s power projection risks military clash in Mediterranean, former PM says","By Orhan Coskun and Dominic Evans
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey risks military confrontation in the eastern Mediterranean because it prizes power over diplomacy, a former prime minister who championed a less confrontational policy in the first decade of President Tayyip Erdogan's rule told Reuters.
Ahmet Davutoglu, whose ""zero problems with neighbors"" mantra was a hallmark of Erdogan's early dealings with Europe and the Middle East, broke with the president's ruling AK Party last year to set up the rival Gelecek (Future) Party.
He criticized what he described as a lurch toward authoritarianism under Turkey's new executive presidency, and accused the government of mishandling a series of challenges including the economy, the coronavirus outbreak and the growing tensions in the eastern Mediterranean.
Last month Turkey sent a survey vessel, escorted by frigates, to explore for oil and gas in waters claimed by Greece, a move Athens said was illegal. The two NATO allies are locked in a dispute over the extent of their continental shelves and maritime economic zones. 
The European Union, backing EU members Greece and Cyprus, has imposed minor sanctions against Turkey, and a collision between Greek and Turkish warships shadowing the survey vessel last month highlighted the potential for military escalation. 
Davutoglu said Ankara had genuine grievances over Greek claims to tens of thousands of square kilometers of sea extending up to Turkey's Mediterranean coast, but added that Erdogan's approach carried high risks.
""Unfortunately our government is not doing a proper diplomatic performance,"" he said in an interview, warning that if both Greece and Turkey prefer ""power projections"" over diplomacy, ""at any time any crisis may erupt and escalate"".
TIME TO TALK
Turkey should say clearly to the European Union: ""'Let's come around the table and share all views',"" Davutoglu said. It should also sit down with Greece to ""discuss all matters (and) de-escalate the tension"".
Erdogan's government said it was on the verge of announcing a resumption of talks with Greece last month when Athens signed a deal setting out its maritime border with Egypt - an agreement which cut across waters claimed by Turkey.
Ankara cut off the process in protest, and a visit to Greece and Turkey by Germany's foreign minister last week appeared to make no headway. EU leaders will discuss the standoff later this month and could take further action against Turkey.
Davutoglu, who served as Erdogan's foreign minister from 2009 to 2014 and then as prime minister for two subsequent years, worked to strengthen Turkish ties and influence in the Mediterranean and Middle East. 
But years of talks with Greece were suspended in 2016, and Davutoglu's Middle East strategy was derailed in the turmoil of the Arab uprisings, when relations with Syria and Egypt collapsed over Ankara's support for Muslim Brotherhood groups.

Davutoglu's Future Party is one of two which has broken away from Erdogan's AKP. Neither has registered above low single figures in recent polls, but by eroding the AKP's support they have made Erdogan's quest for a majority in elections due by 2023 more challenging.

In a transcript of an interview with Austria's ORF TV, Djukanovic said the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) would accept that the three opposition alliances jointly secured a majority of 41 deputies in the tiny Balkan country's 81-seat parliament on Sunday. 
""We are ready to accept this election outcome (and) to be a responsible (and) the strongest opposition party,"" Djukanovic said in the interview aired on Wednesday. A transcript of the interview was published on the presidential website on Thursday.
""We will see whether this ... tripartite coalition ... can really ... form the government,"" Djukanovic said. 
The DPS and Djukanovic, steered Montenegro through the violent collapse of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, the dissolution of a state union with Serbia and accession to NATO.
Djukanovic faces re-election in 2023, but opposition leaders have urged him to resign before his mandate ends. 
The three opposition alliances have said they are ready to form a government and that they would continue Montenegro's bid to join the European Union. They would have three months to form a government after the creation of a new parliament. 
The final preliminary vote count by the State Election Commission gave DPS 35.06% of the vote on Sunday. The final official result is expected in the coming days.
An alliance of Serb nationalist parties named For the Future of Montenegro, which wants closer ties with Serbia and Russia and is backed by the powerful Serbian Orthodox Church, won 32.55% of the vote.
A centre-right grouping, Peace is Our Nation, which is also opposed to Djukanovic's DPS, secured 12.53%. Another alliance led by the green URA party won 5.53% of votes.

Opposition leaders, and democracy and human rights watchdogs, have long accused Djukanovic and his party of running Montenegro as their own corrupt fiefdom with links to organised crime. The DPS and Djukanovic deny the charges.

China, which claims Taiwan as its sovereign territory, has condemned Czech Senate speaker Milos Vystrcil for going. The Chinese government's top diplomat Wang Yi said this week he would pay a ""heavy price"" for visiting the democratic island.
Vystrcil declared himself to be Taiwanese in a speech at Taiwan's parliament on Tuesday, channelling the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy's defiance of communism in Berlin in 1963, further angering Beijing but winning plaudits in Taipei.
Speaking with Vystrcil by his side Taipei, Taiwan parliament Speaker You Si-kun praised his ""stirring"" speech at the legislature.
Vystrcil ""was gentle and elegant, a paragon of a cultured country, like spring sunshine, splendid and warn - Taiwan's people were deeply moved"", You said.
""Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's vulgar threats however were like a cold, unwelcome winter wind that cause discomfort.""
Vystrcil said he had invited You to lead a delegation to Prague for what he termed a ""working visit"", and dismissed China's criticisms. 
""Of course I don't like the statements, but I do not feel I have crossed a red line whatsoever, as I don't think we did anything that was an infringement of the 'one China' policy as the Czech Republic has it within its foreign policy,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter.
""As I have always said, democratic and free countries should always cooperate. There's nothing to be changed on that approach.""
The Czech Republic, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. China demands countries it has relations with accept that Taiwan belongs to ""one China"".

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has ordered tougher scrutiny of visa requests by a Chinese non-profit headed by a senior official of the ruling communist party, designating it as an entity of concern in a broader security sweep, sources involved in the matter say. 
The closer monitoring of the Chinese Association for International Understanding (CAIFU) comes at a time when India and China are locked in their most serious border dispute in more than half a century.
This week India expanded a ban on China's mobile apps in a new move to counter its dominant position in internet services, following tighter approval norms for investment by its firms, and tougher rules for companies joining in government tenders.
Its latest step also follows tougher scrutiny of Chinese cultural and language institutions such as Confucius Institutes in the United States and partnerships in Australia.
Indian officials say the well-resourced Beijing-based group is tied to the Communist Party Central Committee's United Front Work Department, which runs influence operations outside China by cultivating leaders, members of think tanks and the media.
In an internal memo, the Indian government has listed the body as an entity of concern, signaling that its activities could run counter to national interests, said two officials aware of the matter. 
The new category means that the body's representatives, or groups it backs, will face a security clearance procedure before visas can be issued, said the officials, who sought anonymity because they were not authorized to speak in public. 
""Visa (NYSE:V) requests will be looked at very closely, whether it is think-tankers, businessmen,"" one of them added.
China's Foreign Ministry said the association, headed by Ji Bingxuan, vice chair of China's largely rubber stamp parliament, the National People’s Congress, was a non-profit engaged in friendly interaction with social bodies from all countries.
""It aims to promote mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and people from all over the world, including India,"" a ministry representative said in response to a Reuters query.
""It also strives to promote the exchange between cultures and civilizations.""
Organizations such as the India-China Economic and Cultural Council based in Beijing that have been sponsoring visas for CAIFU will also be subject to security clearances.
India's home and the foreign ministry did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment. 
The move is part of a broader investigation into Chinese activities in India as political ties sour.
""We do know that the government is looking at various China-related outfits operating in India,"" said Jayadeva Ranade, a China specialist formerly with the Research and Analysis Wing, India's external intelligence service.
SCRUTINY IN U.S., AUSTRALIA 
Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the center that manages Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes in the United States would have to register as a foreign mission. He called the institutes a malign influence on U.S. campuses.
Amid concerns about Chinese state interference in its politics and society, Australia has also looked to improve oversight of some activities by foreign groups and ended other arrangements, while often avoiding naming China specifically.
Last week, Australia said it would introduce laws to give the federal government the power to veto any pacts that local authorities, universities and other public institutions have with foreign governments.
CAIFU has traditionally been headed by a high-ranking Chinese leader, such as a current or former vice chair of the National People’s Congress. 
Its board comprises a current, and two former, vice ministers from the communist party's International Liaison Department. 
""It has a lot of resources at its disposal, intended to win friends and reduce risk for China abroad,"" said Srikanth Kondapalli, a China studies expert at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University. 
A Chinese professor, however, said the new move would make little difference as India has traditionally been strict in handing visas to Chinese scholars and organizations.
""I think the Indian move is more to appease domestic nationalism than a real security threat about Chinese spies,"" said Zhang Jiadong, director of the Center for South Asian Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.

Police entered the 28-year-old's home on Wednesday with a search warrant after she encouraged others on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to attend a pandemic ""freedom day"" on Saturday, to protest restrictions designed to contain a second coronavirus outbreak in Victoria.
Video footage shot by her partner shows Victorian state police wearing masks handcuffing the pyjama-clad woman, while he pleaded with them to let her remove the post. 
Scores of people took to social media to criticize the arrest of the expectant mother for simply promoting a peaceful protest, while some lawyers also said the police actions had been disproportionate. 
""The footage of (the woman's) arrest portrays no threat posed by her conduct which was suggestive of the need to apply handcuffs,"" Wendy Harris, the president of the Victorian Bar, told The Age newspaper. 
The woman did not return requests for comment when contacted by Reuters. 
She earlier told reporters outside her home she had not been aware her social media posts would break the law. ""Sorry about my bimbo moment, I didn't realize I wasn't allowed to. I'm just a passionate person. I'm sick of the lockdowns.""
Victorian police's assistant commissioner Luke Cornelius said that while the ""optics"" of arresting a pregnant lady were ""terrible"", the officers' actions had been appropriate.
The woman had been charged with incitement and released on bail, following an investigation into the planning of protests in Ballarat, northwest of Melbourne, a police spokesman said in a statement. 
The state capital is nearing the end of a six-week lockdown, while Ballarat has been under less severe restrictions since early August.
""Those still thinking of attending the protest in Ballarat on Saturday can expect a swift and firm response from police,"" the spokesman said in an email.
Human Rights Watch's Australia director Elaine Pearson said that regardless of the pandemic restrictions, the arrest ""creates an alarming precedent"".
""Heavy-handed police tactics could strengthen the resolve of the anti-lockdown movement and simply serve their interests by galvanizing members.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - At least two people were reported killed and thousands were temporarily without power as Typhoon Maysak smashed into the Korean peninsula on Thursday, bringing heavy rain and lashing winds to areas still recovering from Typhoon Bavi.
The ninth typhoon of the season and the fourth to hit the peninsula this year left about 120,000 households without power across South Korea, officials said.
Flights were canceled or delayed and downed trees and other debris caused light damage, Yonhap news agency reported.
One person died when winds shattered a window in South Korea's second-largest city of Busan, which bore the brunt of the storm's 170 kph (105 mph) winds, Yonhap reported.
Another man in the city was found dead, believed to have fallen from the roof of his house while repairing a leak, the agency reported.
The peninsula typically sees only one typhoon a year, but another typhoon, Haishen, is brewing south of Japan and is expected to hit the Korean coast on Sunday or Monday, NASA's Earth Observatory reported.
A ship carrying 43 crew and nearly 6,000 cattle from New Zealand to China capsized in the wild weather in the East China Sea, according to a surviving crew member.
The Gulf Livestock 1 sent a distress call from the west of Amami Oshima island in southwestern Japan on Wednesday as Typhoon Maysak barreled toward the Korean peninsula. 
Some of the areas hardest hit on Thursday were still counting the cost of last week's Typhoon Bavi and one of the wettest monsoon seasons on record. 
Parts of the South Korean resort island of Jeju reported more than 1,000mm (39 inches) of rainfall since Tuesday, according to the weather agency.
North Korea took the brunt of Typhoon Bavi, and for a second week in a row state TV carried rare live reports of storm surge and flooding, including in the coastal town on Wonsan. 
The reports showed a damaged bridge and flooded farmland, while a van with loudspeakers broadcast warnings to residents.
Later in the day, state TV reported that the typhoon warning had been lifted, with no immediate reports of casualties.
North Korea's agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable to severe weather, and this summer's storms and floods have raised concerns over the country's tenuous food situation. 

The string of storms are being fueled by ""extremely warm water of the tropical Western Pacific"", NASA reported.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan negotiators and senior officials will fly to Doha for peace talks with the Taliban after the two sides reached a compromise over the release of prisoners, diplomatic and government sources said.
All but seven of the 5,000 prisoners whose release the Taliban had demanded as a precondition for negotiations have been freed, four government and diplomatic sources told Reuters. 
National security advisor spokesman Javid Faisal confirmed that all but ""a small number"" of the remaining Taliban prisoners had been released, in return for the insurgent group freeing security force members in line with the government's demands. 
""Diplomatic efforts are ongoing,"" he said in a tweet, referring to the final few prisoners who international partners objected to releasing. ""We expect direct talks to start promptly.""
The Taliban did not respond to a request for comment. 
It was not immediately clear when the talks would start.
A government source said they could begin as soon as Saturday, but a second source subsequently said that initial plans for the government delegation to fly to Doha on Thursday had been postponed.
Deadlock over the Taliban prisoners had stalled the United States-brokered negotiations for months.
The release of the final batch of 400, who the government blamed for some of the worst violence committed in the country, has been debated for weeks. 
They included the small number whose release was objected to by Western powers due to their involvement in attacks on foreign forces. 
Five sources told Reuters the plan was for seven remaining prisoners to be transferred to Doha, where they would be kept under supervision.
The seven were members of the Afghan National Security Forces arrested on charges of attacking troops they were stationed with, an Afghan official said, marking them as sympathisers with or covert members of the Taliban.
Washington has been trying to broker peace talks to end 19 years of war since signing a troop withdrawal deal with the Taliban in February.

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>","Backroom deals, old-school politics help rise of Japan's likely new premier","By Linda Sieg and Sakura Murakami
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's ruling party has yet to vote on a successor to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe but his loyal lieutenant looks set to win the post, the result of backroom maneuvering and bargaining that began months before Abe said he'd quit over ill health.
Yoshihide Suga, Abe's chief cabinet secretary, emerged this week as the frontrunner in the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) Sept. 14 leadership race when five of the party's seven factions backed him, before he even announced his candidacy on Wednesday. 
The new LDP leader is almost guaranteed to become prime minister because of the party's majority in parliament's lower house.
The choice of Suga highlights the lingering influence of factions and old-school, personal politics and his alliance with the LDP's chief manager of party funds, rather than policy debates, party insiders say. 
However, the image of backroom dealing - muted during Abe's nearly eight years in office - could dent Suga's credibility with voters in a general election that must be held by late 2021. 
""There's no way that the leader gets elected as a result of a debate over policy, it's impossible,"" said Shizuka Kamei, 83, a former LDP heavyweight who spent 38 years in parliament and was one of five party barons who met secretly to pick a successor to then-premier Keizo Obuchi after he suffered a stroke in April 2000.
For decades, the conservative LDP was dominated by factions whose bosses backed rival candidates in multi-member constituencies, collected and handed out campaign funds, and used their clout to launch runs at the premiership.
That influence was weakened by reforms in the 1990s, but faction bosses still play big roles in the allocation of party and cabinet posts and in determining who wins leadership races.
THREE DINNERS
Unusually, Suga himself is not a member of any faction, making his rise all the more notable. However, party insiders say his path to frontrunner was aided by his alliance with party heavyweight Toshihiro Nikai, the LDP's secretary general, cemented at three highly publicized dinners since June. 
Talk that Abe might step down early, before his term as LDP leader and hence, premier, ends in September 2021, has simmered for months due to his low voter ratings, and gathered steam after reports his chronic illness had worsened.
Nikai, 81, has considerable clout because he effectively controls how the party allocates campaign funds, money that used to be disbursed by faction heads until the 1990s reforms.
Nikai is ""an old-school politician who does old-school politics"", said Katsuyuki Yakushiji, a professor at Toyo University.
""For him, public opinion is irrelevant. Nikai has teamed up with Suga to garner support for Suga and set him up as the next prime minister"". 
Nikai would benefit from a Suga premiership because Suga is most likely to let Nikai remain in his powerful post.
Nikai could not immediately be reached for comment.
Suga got a big boost on Tuesday when the LDP's general affairs committee decided to hold a slimmed-down leadership poll, limiting voting to its members of parliament and three representatives from each local chapter.
It rejected calls for a full-scale election that would include rank-and-file members, saying such a vote would take too long and leave a political vacuum, although the outgoing premier stays in his job until after the new leader is chosen.
The committee opted for a format that favors Suga over main rival Shigeru Ishiba, a former defense minister more popular with the public and grassroots LDP members.
OLD-STYLE
The old-style maneuvering annoyed many rank-and-file LDP members and younger lawmakers.
""This should not be decided secretively,"" said Ryusuke Doi, secretary general of the LDP's chapter in Kanagawa near Tokyo. ""I think they did this to crush Ishiba.""
Ishiba has been a rare LDP critic of Abe during his nearly eight-year rule, has long shunned factions and now heads a group with just 19 members. 
He also topped surveys of lawmakers whom voters preferred as next prime minister.
He has said the election format was ""very regrettable"" and bad for both democracy and the party. 
Among Suga's backers are the 98-member strong Hosoda faction, from which Abe hails, and Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso's group with 54 MPs. 
Abe had long been thought to favor another candidate, former foreign minister Fumio Kishida.
But Kishida failed to enthuse ordinary voters, ranking low in public opinion polls, and Abe ultimately declined to give him public backing, effectively clearing the way for Suga.
Once Suga gained momentum, other faction leaders jumped on the bandwagon to ensure their members had a good shot at winning cabinet and party executive posts in the new regime, and ensure continuity of the status quo, sources said.
For all the similarities to the days of old-school LDP politics, there is one key distinction: Suga's status as neither a member nor leader of a faction.
""Factions are still important, but it's not like the old days when there were powerful faction leaders who all wanted to become prime minister,"" said Gerry Curtis, a professor emeritus at Columbia University.

""Suga is the most powerful person and he's not even in a faction.""

Malaysia's government on Tuesday said it would from Sept. 7 bar entry of pass holders from India, Indonesia and the Philippines in a bid to curtail imported coronavirus cases in Southeast Asia's third-largest economy.
The ban will now include all countries that have reported more than 150,000 coronavirus cases, the report said, citing senior minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob.
Malaysia, which has reported just 9,374 COVID-19 cases and 128 deaths as of Thursday, has banned tourists and business traveler from entering the country since March, when it imposed strict curbs on movement and commerce to contain the spread.
The move to further tighten entry restrictions follows the discovery of new clusters sparked by infections among returnees and undocumented migrants.
The expanded list also includes Brazil, France, Spain, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Bangladesh.
""We will add more (countries) that are considered high risk,"" Ismail Sabri was quoted as saying by Bernama.
Ismail Sabri had earlier said that the ban would include permanent residents, expatriates, students and those on spouse visas and participants of Malaysia's My Second Home programme.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - One of Malaysia's youngest lawmakers will start a youth-based party this month with the hope of changing a political landscape long dominated by ""old hands"" and money politics. 
Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman, 27, said the yet-to-be-named party would seek equal representation for women and young people in parliament and do away with a patronage system that critics say has blunted the Southeast Asian country's competitiveness. 
""We want to unshackle Malaysia from the type of politics based on money and power, and refresh it with young people with the right heart, mind and interests who can move Malaysia forward,"" he told Reuters on Thursday.
Syed Saddiq said he drew inspiration from French President Emmanuel Macron's youth-oriented En Marche and Thailand's Future Forward Party in his bid to shake up a political culture that has been run by aging stalwarts for decades. 
The average age of Malaysian lawmakers is around 55, a worrying concern for the country where the median age of its 32 million-strong population is 29. 
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, 73, took office in March after the resignation of 95-year-old Mahathir Mohamad, who served as premier twice including a 22-year stint that ended in 2003.
Mahathir has founded his own party to take on former ally Muhyiddin, who holds a slim majority in parliament. 
Muhyiddin also faces a challenge from an opposition alliance led by 73-year-old Anwar Ibrahim, whose on-again, off-again feud with Mahathir has shaped political conversation since the 1990s. 
""There's a real desire for a fresh political culture to replace the current one which is outdated and has failed to engage young people,"" said Qyira Yusri, a youth activist who was in early talks to join Syed Saddiq's party this week.
Syed Saddiq said the talks involved 33 young people of diverse ethnicities and backgrounds, including academics, religious leaders and members of the technology and corporate sectors. 
He remains confident that the group's diversity will be an asset despite differences over controversial issues such as same-sex relationships, which is outlawed in the Muslim-majority country. 
Syed Saddiq first came to national prominence after joining hands with Mahathir to oust a corruption-tainted government in 2018. He became Malaysia's youngest cabinet member after being appointed as the youth and sports minister in Mahathir's administration. 
But the experience left him disillusioned with political parties' reliance on raising money through business dealings and cronyism. 
The new party will seek to cap political donations from private entities and instead rely on new methods such as online crowdfunding, he said.
Mahathir told a news conference on Thursday he was not confident the group would be successful.
""I don't think it will be very successful, because although the youth are a big portion of the electorate, it's not enough for people to win just because they have the support of the youth."" 

Malaysia is not due to hold a general election till 2023 but there has been speculation there could be early polls.

TOKYO/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A ship carrying 43 crew and nearly 6,000 cattle from New Zealand to China capsized after losing an engine in stormy weather in the East China Sea, the only crew member rescued so far told Japan's coastguard on Thursday.
The Gulf Livestock 1 sent a distress call from the west of Amami Oshima island in southwestern Japan on Wednesday as Typhoon Maysak lashed the area with strong winds and heavy seas. 
Japan's coastguard said it had rescued one crew member, Sareno Edvarodo, a 45-year-old chief officer from the Philippines, on Wednesday night (Tokyo time) while searching for the ship. 
According to Edvarodo, the ship lost an engine before it was hit by a wave and capsized, a coastguard spokeswoman said. 
When the ship capsized, crew were instructed to put on lifejackets. Edvarodo told the coastguard he jumped into the water and did not see any other crew members before he was rescued.
Pictures provided by the coastguard showed a person in a lifejacket being hauled from choppy seas in darkness.
Three vessels, five airplanes and two divers had been deployed to continue the search, the coastguard said. 
The crew included 39 people from the Philippines, two from New Zealand, and two from Australia, it added.
The Philippines government said it was coordinating with the Japanese coastguard as it searched for the missing crew members ahead of another typhoon building in the region.
Typhoon Haishen is brewing south of Japan and is expected to hit the Korean coast on Sunday or Monday. 
At least one person was reported killed in South Korea in the southern city of Busan after Typhoon Maysak made landfall on Thursday, bringing strong winds and heavy rain.

LIVE CATTLE EXPORT IN SPOTLIGHT
The Gulf Livestock 1 departed Napier in New Zealand on Aug. 14 with a cargo of 5,867 cattle bound for the Port of Jingtang in Tangshan, China. The journey was expected to take about 17 days, New Zealand's foreign ministry told Reuters.
The 139 metre (450 ft), Panamanian-flagged vessel was built in 2002 and the registered owner is Amman-based Rahmeh Compania Naviera SA, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The ship manager is Hijazi & Ghosheh Co. Calls to the owner and manager were unanswered.
New Zealand animal rights organisation SAFE said the tragedy demonstrated the risks of the live animal export trade.
""These cows should never have been at sea,"" said campaigns manager Marianne Macdonald.
""This is a real crisis, and our thoughts are with the families of the 43 crew who are missing with the ship. But questions remain, including why this trade is allowed to continue.""
Last year, New Zealand launched a review of its live export trade, worth around NZ$54 million ($37 million) in 2019, after thousands of animals being exported from New Zealand and Australia died in transit. 

New Zealand’s Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) said it had temporarily suspended live cattle export applications after the Gulf Livestock 1 went missing.

Thursday's verdict was for a case that dates back to 2017 and was unrelated to his arrest. Lai, who is a key critic of Beijing, had used foul language when confronting a reporter from Oriental Daily News, a major competitor to Lai’s tabloid Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily. Police however only charged him in February this year.
The mainland-born media magnate had pleaded not guilty. 
Dressed in a light grey suit and green shirt, he smiled after the verdict was read out and shook hands with supporters who filled the courtroom.
His case comes after he was arrested for suspected collusion with foreign forces on August 10, making him the highest profile person to be arrested under the Beijing imposed law.
The 71-year-old had been a frequent visitor to Washington, where he met officials including U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a “traitor” 
After Lai's August arrest around 200 police officers searched the office of his Apple Daily newspaper. 
The national security law punishes anything China considers subversion, succession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Critics say it crushes freedoms, while supporters say it will bring stability after prolonged anti-China, pro-democracy protests last year. 
Lai's pro-democratic Apple Daily has vied with pro-Beijing Oriental Daily for readership in the special administrative region. In 2014 Oriental Daily published a fake obituary of Lai, claiming that he had died of AIDS and many types of cancer.
Prosecutors in the case said Lai had intimidated the Oriental Daily reporter.
Lai's lawyers said Lai had been followed by reporters for three years and his comments were not intended to harm the reporter but expressed his exasperation.

Lai is also facing separate court cases for illegal assembly relating to anti-government protests last year.

Anyone entering the capital, Naypyitaw, where the government is based, will be quarantined, tested, and allowed entry only if their result is negative, according to a government order published on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
People coming from the country's worst-hit areas will be quarantined in a facility for at least seven days, said the order by the Naypyitaw Council, while others will be allowed to leave earlier if they test negative.
Myanmar reported its first local transmission in a month in mid-August in the restive western Rakhine state. Since then, the number of cases has roughly doubled to 1,059 infections and six deaths, according to government data. 
The majority of the cases and deaths have been in Rakhine, where government troops are fighting ethnic insurgents and authorities have imposed sweeping curbs on internet access.
Most recent infections have been in that state's capital, Sittwe, where officials have imposed a stay-at-home order and a curfew.
Sittwe is also home to camps where about 100,000 Rohingya Muslims have been confined since an outbreak of violence in 2012. Rohingya are mostly denied citizenship and face strict curbs on freedom of movement and access to healthcare.
But infections have been found across the country including in the biggest city, Yangon. Authorities imposed a partial lockdown in parts of Yangon on Tuesday, ordering residents of the worst-hit townships to stay at home other than for essential journeys. Bars and nightclubs have been closed. 
Suu Kyi said those who disobeyed instructions would face punishment under the Natural Disaster Law, which carries prison terms of up to a year. 
""More strict action will be taken under the Natural Disaster Law. This is a disaster for the country,"" she said in a video broadcast on Wednesday. 
""If the pandemic spreads widely in Yangon, it will be very difficult to provide medical treatment to the people,"" she said. 

Doctors say they fear a major outbreak in the country, which has a health system ranked among the world’s worst after decades of neglect under military rule. Many services are run by volunteers and aid groups.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Defence Minister Taro Kono on Thursday said he supports Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga as the country's next leader to provide continuity in tackling the coronavirus crisis but also predicted he will one day be prime minister.
Identified early by local media as a potential candidate, Kono had considered entering the leadership race to replace retiring Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, but decided against it after Suga announced his decision to run.
""It is important to contain COVID-19 and at the same time we need to restart the economy,"" Kono said in an interview with Reuters. ""One day I will be the prime minister,"" he added.
Suga on Wednesday announced he would run in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) election to pick a new leader, promising to stick to Abe's policies.
With backing of several party factions, including the one that Kono is a member of, Abe's longtime ally has emerged as the front runner in the race.
Abe announced on Friday he was resigning because of poor health, ending his tenure as Japan's longest-serving prime minister. A leadership election is set for Sept. 14 with LDP lawmakers and regional party representatives casting votes.
The winner is virtually assured of becoming prime minister because of the LDP's parliamentary majority. 
Kono, 57, who has also served as foreign minister, said he wanted Japan's next leader to focus on rebuilding public finances once the pandemic had ended.
""We need to secure our social security, how we are going to provide social security, pensions, medical, childcare. I think that's going to be very important, and that needs to be thoroughly discussed,"" Kono said.  
Educated at Georgetown University and a fluent English speaker, he has recently hosted live question and answer session on Youtube, unusual for Japanese politicians, to answer question ranging from national security to his personal tastes.
Despite his reputation as a maverick he has, nonetheless, toed the line on key Abe policies, including a tough approach toward South Korea in a feud over wartime history. 
That has differentiated him from his father, Yohei Kono, a former chief cabinet secretary who authored a landmark 1993 apology to “comfort women”, a euphemism for women from Korea and other places forced to work wartime military brothels.

Kono said he was ready ""anytime"" when asked when he wanted to be prime minister.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) is proposing resuming flights to Guangzhou, Seoul, Vientiane, Phnom Penh, Taipei and Tokyo, which would mean about 5,000 travellers arriving each week, the transport ministry-run Giao Thong newspaper reported, citing CAAV deputy head, Vo Huy Cuong.
Those arriving must still undergo two weeks of quarantine, according to health ministry requirements, unless the duration of their visit is under 14 days. Vietnam has not yet reopened to tourists.
Vietnam is seeking to revive its economic activities, especially tourism and transport, which have been badly hit by the travel restrictions.
It stopped flights from certain countries in late January before closing its borders in March to all but returning citizens and foreigners with special permission, as the coronavirus spread quickly around the world.
The travel curbs together with strict quarantine, testing and contact tracing has helped Vietnam keep its infections total to just 1,046 and 34 deaths and saw it record a run of 100 days without domestic transmission.
The move to resume flights contrasts with several of its regional neighbours, which are suffering big losses from tight restrictions on foreign tourists and business travellers, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand.
Flag carrier  Vietnam Airlines  (HM:HVN), its unit Pacific Airlines and budget carrier Vietjet Air (HM:VJC) will conduct the flights and the number of inbound visitors will be limited, the reports said. 

In July, Vietnam Airlines said it would lose 50 trillion dong ($2.16 billion) in revenue this year and might liquidity issues.

On Wednesday, the Olongapo trial court has ordered the freeing of Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton, sent to prison in 2015 for killing Jennifer Laude, saying he was eligible for early release from a six- to 10-year sentence under the government's good behaviour programme.
Harry Roque, a spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte who served as lawyer in the prosecution of Pemberton, told a media briefing Philippine prison officials will not process his release until the local court decides on an appeal filed by the victim's lawyer questioning the early release on Wednesday.
The court's release order has revived old tensions over the role of U.S. military in the country, with Roque joining human rights activists in slamming the decision.
Pemberton has so far served less than six years after being convicted of killing Laude in a hotel in Olongapo in 2014, outside a former U.S. navy base northwest of the capital. The killing stirred heated debate in the country over the U.S. military presence in its former colony.
Pemberton has been detained at a military jail.
Roque said on Wednesday ""Laude's death personifies the death of Philippine sovereignty"", adding ""despite the President's independent foreign policy, Americans continue to have the status of conquering colonials in our country.""
Human rights activists on Thursday slammed what they called ""a travesty of justice"" after the court ruling. 
""We feel this decision indicates that there is double standard of justice in the Philippines,"" Cristina Palabay, Secretary General of human rights group Karapatan, told Reuters. ""This goes to show how favoured still U.S. interests are in the country.""
The U.S. military formerly had two huge military bases in the Philippines but was evicted from them in 1992 before the two countries revived close ties from 2000 with war games, frequent diplomatic visits and cooperation against communist and Muslim insurgents.

But the relationship has soured under Duterte, who says the U.S. military presence makes his country a target for conflict, especially if tensions escalate between the Washington and Beijing in the South China Sea.

Seaver, who was nicknamed ""The Franchise"" and ""Tom Terrific"" because of how valuable he was to the Mets, died in his sleep on Monday from complications of Lewy body dementia and COVID-19, the Baseball Hall of Fame said in a statement.
""He was simply the greatest Mets player of all-time,"" Mets owner Fred Wilpon and his son Jeff, a top executive with the team, said in a statement.
Seaver captured the National League Rookie of the Year Award in 1967 and then blossomed into greatness in 1969 when he won the National League Cy Young Award as the top pitcher after leading the major leagues in victories with 25.
That was also the season the Mets, who had been among MLB's worst teams from their inception in 1962 and were known as the lovable losers, captured their first World Series title behind the powerful right arm of Seaver.
""Tom was a gentleman who represented the best of our National Pastime,"" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.
""He was synonymous with the New York Mets and their unforgettable 1969 season. After their improbable World Series championship, Tom became a household name to baseball fans - a responsibility he carried out with distinction throughout his life.""
Seaver, who served in the U.S. Marine Corps, also played for the Cincinnati Reds, Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox during a major league career that spanned 1967-1986. He won 311 games and earned 12 All-Star selections.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Twitter confirmed on Thursday that an account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal website was hacked with a series of tweets asking its followers to donate to a relief fund through cryptocurrency.
The incident comes after several Twitter accounts of prominent personalities were hacked in July.
Twitter said it was aware of the activity with Modi's website account and has taken steps to secure it.
""We are actively investigating the situation. At this time, we are not aware of additional accounts being impacted,"" a Twitter spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. 
Modi's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the tweets posted on the account @narendramodi_in.
The account, with over 2.5 million followers, is the official Twitter handle for Modi's personal website (https://www.narendramodi.in/) and the Narendra Modi mobile application. 
Modi's personal Twitter account, which was unaffected by this incident, has over 61 million followers.
The tweets, which have since been taken down, asked the followers to donate to the PM National Relief Fund through cryptocurrency.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A special strain of New Yorker showed up at Chelsea Piers Fitness on Wednesday morning, the first time gyms have been allowed to open since the coronavirus pandemic shuttered the city in March.
Broad-shouldered giants insisted through mandatory face masks that, despite nearly 200 pounds of visual evidence to the contrary, they had withered away over five months. Women with sleeked-back ponytails and pronounced abs, tired of months of quiet apartment workouts respectful of downstairs neighbors, let heavy barbells crash to the ground.
In short, it was a communion, in one of Manhattan's most body-conscious neighborhoods, of those for whom the gym is not a chore but a kind of church.
""I'd forgotten this feeling right now, what it's about to feel like,"" Justin Silver, a stand-up comic and dog trainer, said as he settled into a leg press machine. He raised his feet in rapture as quadriceps ballooned out of his thighs.
""Oh my God. I love it!"" 
Gyms, unfairly in the view of some devotees, were seen as riskier than other joints. New Yorkers have been able to dine outdoors at restaurants and shop in non-essential businesses since June, and visit bowling alleys and museums since August.
Last month, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said gyms could reopen statewide with the local mayor's blessing as long as local health departments enforce new safety rules to contain a virus that spreads more easily in confined spaces.
Gyms must operate at 33% capacity, with floors rearranged so patrons can exercise more than 6 feet apart. Gym owners whose revenue had been decimated while paying rent on empty premises had to upgrade air-conditioning systems to meet at least MERV-13 filtration standards. Patrons must attest to their good health and prove to a remote thermometer aimed at their foreheads that they have no fever.
Both the Equinox and Crunch Fitness gym chains have bought back-pack mounted electrostatic disinfecting sprayers to douse equipment throughout the day.
""We've spent the last three or four months planning and preparing to reopen under this new world order,"" Crunch Chief Executive Keith Worts said in an interview.
Mandatory masks that cover the mouth and nose annoyed some at Chelsea Piers.
""I've got to get a better mask,"" personal trainer Rachel Mariotti, 31, said through hers. ""I could barely breathe.""
After a few minutes, she abandoned cardio on a skier machine for powerlifting.
Like others at the gym, Mariotti said she was reassured by the safety measures: it seemed to her less risky than prolonged rides on the relatively more crowded subway.
The gym's denizens were forced to improvise from March, when New York became the global pandemic epicenter and morgue trucks dotted the streets, to September, with more than 99% of all COVID-19 tests in the city coming back negative.
They fiddled at home with resistance bands bought online at a pandemic mark-up, or did pull-ups on city scaffolding, or, craving more than bodyweight, convinced a girlfriend to sit on their backs while they did push-ups.
But none of that could replace the gym's clatter and black iron.
Ian Lane, a 31-year-old Brooklynite who works in events management, took up running loops around Prospect Park, which wrecked his gains from weight-lifting.
""I have lost 20 pounds of muscle over the last six months, so I've a lot of catching up to do. You can only do so many push-ups at home,"" he said.
With an upward gaze, Lane resumed cautiously, squatting with only a 135-pound barbell on his back, far short of the 225 pounds he could pump for six reps at the start of the year.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition must stop ""playing at government"" and start focusing on elections, two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles said on Wednesday, in a rare public swipe at congress chief Juan Guaido's parallel presidency. 
Guaido last year declared President Nicolas Maduro a usurper and assumed an interim presidency that was recognized by dozens of countries including the United States, but Maduro has held on as Guaido's virtual government has become increasingly isolated.
Capriles and legislator Stalin Gonzalez have been in talks with the government over possible participation in the upcoming congressional election, despite a boycott supported by Guaido - opening a rift within the opposition.
""We can't keep playing at government on the internet,"" Capriles said in an internet broadcast. ""Either you're government, or you're opposition. You can't be both."" 
His statement marked the first significant questioning by an opposition leader of Guaido's 2019 decision to assume the presidency amid a groundswell of street mobilizations that renewed hopes for a change of government.
The move led dozens of countries to disavow Maduro in favor of Guaido, and allowed his allies to control crucial offshore Venezuelan assets including U.S. refining subsidiary Citgo. But the fervor of 2019 has faded, and many of Maduro's critics have grown disillusioned with the arrangement.
Guaido's press team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Earlier in the day, Guaido said Venezuela needs unity and solutions to the crisis rather than ""bombastic disagreements between leaders."" 
Capriles, in his first address to the public since news emerged that he was in talks with the Maduro government on elections conditions, said the opposition needed to ensure basic conditions for the vote.
""I call on the country to mobilize and fight,"" he said. ""We're not going to resign. We will not give the National Assembly to Maduro.""
He stopped short of giving details about which candidates would run, and acknowledged there were still ""some roadblocks"" regarding appropriate conditions for the vote, including assurances on international observers.

Lopez Obrador is under increased pressure to help mitigate the effects of climate change.
The plaintiffs from the state Baja California filed a legal stay of proceedings, known locally as amparo, before a district court in administrative matters, several documents related to the case show. 
In it, the youths, aged 17 to 23, demand clearer regulations and public policies derived from the country's existing General Law on Climate Change and the Mexican constitution, the documents showed.
All of the documents, which have not been made public, were provided by a representative of the plaintiffs.
The hearing is scheduled for Sept. 4 and comes just days after the country's environment minister quit.
""There's no bigger mistake than doing nothing based on a belief that one can only do little: However small or simple our actions may seem, they sow what future generations will reap,"" said Gema Osorio, one of the plaintiffs, aged 20.
""My wish is that even if we don't manage to repair the damages, at least we stop continuing to harm the planet,"" she said on Wednesday.
Mexico's previous government had laid out targets to reduce emissions. Lopez Obrador has not reaffirmed those goals, but highlights projects such as a large-scale tree-planting scheme as evidence of commitment to the environment.
The environment ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
National oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, has come under particular pressure from investors looking to reduce the carbon footprint of their investments.
Pemex alone was the ninth biggest energy producer of carbon and methane emissions globally between 1965 and 2018, according to data from the Climate Accountability Institute, a non-profit.

With emissions of some 23 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent, the troubled oil company was the largest emitter among its Latin American peers.

1372,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 07:07PM ET</span>",U.S. court: Mass surveillance program exposed by Snowden was illegal,"By Raphael Satter
(Reuters) - Seven years after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the mass surveillance of Americans' telephone records, an appeals court has found the program was unlawful - and that the U.S. intelligence leaders who publicly defended it were not telling the truth. 
In a ruling handed down on Wednesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said the warrantless telephone dragnet that secretly collected millions of Americans' telephone records violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and may well have been unconstitutional.
Snowden, who fled to Russia in the aftermath of the 2013 disclosures and still faces U.S. espionage charges, said on Twitter that the ruling was a vindication of his decision to go public with evidence of the National Security Agency's domestic eavesdropping operation. 
""I never imagined that I would live to see our courts condemn the NSA's activities as unlawful and in the same ruling credit me for exposing them,"" Snowden said in a message posted to Twitter.
Evidence that the NSA was secretly building a vast database of U.S. telephone records - the who, the how, the when, and the where of millions of mobile calls - was the first and arguably the most explosive of the Snowden revelations published by the Guardian newspaper in 2013. 
Up until that moment, top intelligence officials publicly insisted the NSA never knowingly collected information on Americans at all. After the program's exposure, U.S. officials fell back on the argument that the spying had played a crucial role in fighting domestic extremism, citing in particular the case of four San Diego residents who were accused of providing aid to religious fanatics in Somalia. 
U.S. officials insisted that the four - Basaaly Saeed Moalin, Ahmed Nasir Taalil Mohamud, Mohamed Mohamud, and Issa Doreh - were convicted in 2013 thanks to the NSA's telephone record spying, but the Ninth Circuit ruled Wednesday that those claims were ""inconsistent with the contents of the classified record.""
The ruling will not affect the convictions of Moalin and his fellow defendants; the court ruled the illegal surveillance did not taint the evidence introduced at their trial. Nevertheless, watchdog groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, which helped bring the case to appeal, welcomed the judges' verdict on the NSA's spy program. 

""Today's ruling is a victory for our privacy rights,"" the ACLU said in a statement, saying it ""makes plain that the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records violated the Constitution.""

1373,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>",Verdict expected in case of journalist murder that rocked Slovakia,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - A Slovak court is expected to rule on Thursday on whether an influential businessman ordered the murder of an investigative journalist, in a case that prompted mass street protests and led to the reshaping of the country's political landscape.
The killing of Jan Kuciak, 27, and his fiancee Martina Kusnirova forced then prime minister and longtime leader Robert Fico to step down, and ushered in a new government in March this year whose main election promise was to clean up sleaze.
The couple were gunned down in their home outside Bratislava in February 2018, in a killing that mirrored the murder in Malta four months earlier of another journalist investigating corruption, Daphne Caruana Galizia.
Bringing Kuciak's killers to justice has been a test of Slovakia's judicial and political system, long seen as susceptible to corruption. 
The verdict has been postponed from August, and it is still possible that it may be postponed again after the prosecution asked to present additional evidence.
Prosecutors say Slovak entrepreneur Marian Kocner, the subject of Kuciak's reporting on corruption involving politically connected business people, had ordered the killing of the reporter. Kocner denies the charge.
The investigation has forced the resignation of several senior politicians and judicial officials on account of their previous links to Kocner.
Prosecutors are seeking a 25-year jail sentence for Kocner and for each of his two co-defendants.
Two others have already been convicted in the case after admitting guilt. One of them, a former soldier, received 23 years in prison for killing Kuciak and his girlfriend, while a fifth suspect admitted to facilitating the murder and was given a 15-year sentence.
Kocner, who is well-known in Slovak business and political circles, has already received a 19-year sentence in a separate case after being convicted of forging 69 million euros in promissory notes.
Slovaks' anger over the killing of Kuciak and his fiancee and perceptions of persistent graft helped to usher in activist lawyer Zuzana Caputova as the country's president last year. 

It also opened the way for Igor Matovic's outsider Ordinary People party to win a February parliamentary election this year, allowing him to become prime minister.

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 06:50PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Brazil Amazon fires likely worst in 10 years, August data incomplete, government researcher says","By Jake Spring
BRASILIA (Reuters) - The official August data on the number of fires in Brazil's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) needs to be corrected and will likely show an increase over last year, meaning that blazes surged to a decade high, a scientist responsible for the figures told Reuters on Wednesday. 
Brazilian media has reported that fires in Brazil's section of the Amazon rainforest fell by 5% in August, citing data currently on the website of government space research agency Inpe that has not been corrected.
Alberto Setzer, a senior scientist at Inpe who is involved in producing the official fire data, said that the reporting of finalized data had been delayed by an error with a NASA satellite.
But once that issue is corrected, it will likely show that fires increased by between 1% and 2% in August 2020 compared to the same month a year ago, Setzer said. That would mean it is the worst spate of fires for the month since August 2010.
""It's going to be up. The number of fires, fire pixels, will increase. Maybe up to 1 or 2%, I would guess,"" Setzer said, referring to spots of heat registered on satellite images.
Inpe's press office directed a request for comment to Setzer, who gave more details on his calculations and cautioned that a shift of 1 to 2% is within the margin of error. 
The science and technology ministry, which oversees the space research agency, did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
The press office for President Jair Bolsonaro declined to comment, directing questions to the office of Vice President Hamilton Mourao, who has been placed in charge of Amazon affairs. Mourao's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the environment ministry declined to comment.
A surge in fires in August 2019 to a nine-year high provoked outcry from global leaders and the public that Brazil was not doing enough to protect the world's largest rainforest, with Bolsonaro trading barbs with French President Emmanuel Macron.
Environmental advocates and scientists say that Bolsonaro is to blame for weakening environmental protections and calling for the development of the Amazon, emboldening illegal loggers and land speculators to clear the forest.
The Amazon absorbs vast amounts of carbon dioxide and scientists say its protection is vital to curbing climate change.
Inpe published a note on its website on Aug. 19 that said there had been a problem with NASA's Aqua satellite that generates the fire data and as a consequence the data had been incomplete since Aug. 16.
NASA has similarly published notices on its website warning of issues with the satellite.
Setzer said Inpe has been looking for alternative data sources in order to correct the problem, estimating that it may take one to two weeks for the final data to be published.

Once correcting for the data that is almost entirely missing for the Amazon for Aug. 16, along with smaller differences generated by missing data for the northern Amazon since then, the final number should show a slight rise, he said.

The county also said on Wednesday it would allow hair salons and barber shops to open at 25% capacity. Pandemic-related guidelines in the most populous California county had been briefly stricter than those in most other parts of the state after cases spiked in the summer.
""Right now a cautious and titrated reopening - with close monitoring of what happens to our data in the weeks to follow - is needed to ensure we are not experiencing a significant spike in cases,"" said Barbara Ferrer, the county's director of public health.

Like San Francisco County, which has also been hard-hit by the virus' summer surge, L.A. County did not go along with state rules allowing hair salons and barbershops to re-open for indoor services on Monday. However, Wednesday's action by Ferrer and the Board of Supervisors brings it in line with the rest of the state.

1377,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 05:54PM ET</span>","White House Poised to Set Boundaries of WeChat, TikTok Crackdown","(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is debating the scope and effective date of its bans on Chinese social media apps WeChat and TikTok and will make its decisions public later this month, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Commerce Department, which will implement the bans on national security grounds, is drafting documents to clarify the specific transactions that will be prohibited between the Chinese companies and U.S. businesses -- and when those prohibitions will take effect, the people said.
The decisions will be made public in the Federal Register around Sept. 20, said one of the people close to the discussions who asked not to be named because the deliberations are private. It’s not clear whether the bans will go into effect upon that publication, or whether there will be a transition period to give companies time to comply.
Details on how the ban on Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.’s WeChat will work are key to the bottom line of U.S. companies that do business with the Chinese firm. At stake is whether the restrictions, which President Donald Trump first announced on Aug. 6, will apply just to U.S. transactions or also extend to operations globally, which could cut into sales across a wide swath of American business.
The Sept. 20 date comes at the end of the 45-day timeframe laid out in that initial order.
While some U.S. officials have signaled to the business community that their China operations won’t be impacted, Bloomberg has reported that there are conflicting views between members of Trump’s cabinet and the final outcome isn’t certain.
Transition Period
Companies have been pressing the administration to clarify whether they will be granted a transition period before the ban takes effect or if a Sept. 20 announcement becomes effective immediately.
The ban’s scope and timeline are connected, according to one of the people. For example, if the administration were to apply the restrictions broadly to any Tencent dealings, including its games, companies would have a longer period to comply. If the ban is narrow, companies may get less time or no transition period at all, the person said.
Ultimately, the final decision on whether to extend the ban outside the U.S. lies with Trump, according to the people familiar. A Commerce Department official said the agency doesn’t comment on internal deliberations.
Company Reaction
The administration is taking into account feedback from companies and aims to craft clear guidance to avoid unintended consequences, one of the people said.
If the order applies to American companies operating in China and American citizens there in addition to transactions in the U.S., it will hinder the competitiveness of U.S. firms and their ability to communicate in China, according to an Aug. 26 member survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.
Almost half of the member firms that participated said they’d see lower revenues and 11.3% of them predicted the declines would be greater than 30%.
Separately, Trump has directed TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. to spin off its U.S. operations by mid-September to avoid being banned in the U.S. ByteDance is reviewing bids from American firms, including  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL). and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)., which has teamed up with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. Any sale has to satisfy the Trump administration’s national security concerns, including around data collection and privacy.
The president has the option not to impose a ban on Sept. 20 if TikTok addresses the national security risks outlined in the initial executive order, one person said, which could include selling its U.S. operations to an approved buyer.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro this week reiterated both apps were national security threats and said “there will be others” the administration will go after.
On conference calls with large U.S. technology companies last week, Robert Blair, who is leading the interagency effort for Commerce, listened to their concerns about the order’s scope, but declined to provide details, people familiar with the discussions said.
Blair, who served as special representative for international telecommunications policy in the White House before moving to the Commerce Department in April, also said on the call with companies that he couldn’t comment on whether there would be a transition period, they said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Seventy-six wealthy nations are now committed to joining a global COVID-19 vaccine allocation plan co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO) that aims to help buy and fairly distribute the shots, the project's co-lead said on Wednesday.
Seth Berkley, chief executive of the GAVI vaccines alliance, said the coordinated plan, known as COVAX, now has Japan, Germany, Norway and more than 70 other nations signed up, agreeing in principle to procure COVID-19 vaccines through the facility for their populations.
""We have, as of right now, 76 upper middle income and high income countries that have submitted confirmations of intent to participate - and we expect that number to go up,"" Berkley told Reuters in an interview. 
""This is good news. It shows that the COVAX facility is open for business and is attracting the type of interest across the world we had hoped it would,"" he said. 
COVAX coordinators are in talks with China about whether it might also join, Berkley said. 
""We had a discussion yesterday with the (Chinese) government,"" Berkley said. ""We don't have any signed agreement with them yet,"" but Beijing has given ""a positive signal,"" he added.
COVAX is co-led by GAVI, the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and is designed to discourage national governments from hoarding COVID-19 vaccines and to focus on first vaccinating the most high-risk people in every country. 
Its backers say this strategy should lead to lower vaccine costs for everyone and a swifter end to the pandemic that has claimed some 860,000 lives globally.
Wealthy countries that join COVAX will finance the vaccine purchases from their national budgets, and will partner with 92 poorer nations supported through voluntary donations to the plan to ensure vaccines are delivered equitably, Berkley said.
Participating wealthy countries are also free to procure vaccines through bilateral deals and other plans. 
The United States said on Tuesday it would not join COVAX due to the Trump administration's objection to WHO involvement, a move described by some critics as ""disappointing"". Berkley said he was not surprised by the U.S. decision, but would seek to continue talks with Washington.
In what appeared to be a change of position on Wednesday, the European Union said its member states could buy potential COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX.
COVAX coordinators sought to add flexibility to joining agreements to encourage greater participation, Berkley said. 
The WHO describes COVAX as an ""invaluable insurance policy"" for all countries to secure access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines when they are developed and approved. The plan's coordinators have set a deadline of September 18 for countries signing up to make binding commitments.
COVAX's aim is to procure and deliver 2 billion doses of approved vaccines by the end of 2021. It currently has nine COVID-19 vaccine candidates in its portfolio employing a range of different technologies and scientific approaches.

A handful are already in late-stage clinical trials and could have data available by year end.

1379,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>","Amid plans to quit, U.S. will not pay what it owes WHO this year","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday that it will not pay some $80 million it currently owes to the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) and will instead redirect the money to help pay its United Nations bill in New York. 
The United States plans to leave WHO on July 6, 2021, after President Donald Trump accused it of becoming a puppet for China during the coronavirus pandemic. The WHO rejected Trump's assertions. 
Under a 1948 joint resolution of the U.S. Congress, Trump had to give one-year notice of the U.S. withdrawal from the WHO and is required to pay what Washington's owes for the organization's current fiscal year.
Nerissa Cook, State Department Bureau of International Organization Affairs deputy assistant secretary of state, said the United States currently owes the WHO some $18 million for financial year 2019 and $62 million for financial year 2020.
""Those together are being reprogrammed to the U.N. to pay the regular U.N. assessment,"" said Cook, referring to money that Washington is required to pay the United Nations in New York. 
Dr. Alma Golden, U.S. Agency for International Development assistant administrator for global health, said that in most cases Washington had identified new partners to continue the global health assistance it had carried out with the WHO. 
But she said a one-time payment of $68 million would be made to the WHO for health assistance in Libya and Syria and efforts to eradicate polio in priority countries because these ""reflect the few cases in which WHO has the unique capability that an alternate partner could not replicate at this time."" 
Trump's political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, has said he would rejoin the WHO if he defeats Trump in a November election.

(Reuters) - Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said he planned to move out of his apartment after repeated protests outside his building demanding he resign over his handling of months of anti-racism protests in the Oregon city, according to a report.
In a Tuesday email, Wheeler told residents of the building in downtown Portland it would be best for their safety if he found a new home, The Oregonian newspaper reported on its website.
“I want to express my sincere apologies for the damage to our home and the fear that you are experiencing due to my position,” Wheeler wrote, according to a screenshot of the email sent to The Oregonian. 
Wheeler's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Portland has seen over 90 days of protests calling for policing and social justice reforms since the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, by police in Minneapolis on May 25. 
Demonstrators have gathered outside Wheeler’s building calling for him to step down over police violence, including the use of tear gas against demonstrators. 
Police declared a riot on Monday and arrested 19 people as some graffitied the walls of the building, smashed windows and threw burning material inside, Portland Police said.
President Donald Trump has seized on civil unrest in Portland and other cities to criticize Democratic leaders and call for ""law and order"" ahead of the Nov. 3 election.
""Mayor Wheeler just got harassed out of his own home in Portland by so-called “friendly protesters”. The Anarchists, Agitators and Looters treat him HORRIBLY, even though he is so nice and respectful to them. Criminals only understand strength!,"" Trump tweeted on Wednesday.

Wheeler, who has blamed Trump for stoking clashes, on Tuesday asked the city to join him in ""denouncing violence"" after a Trump supporter was shot dead in Portland on Saturday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Russia has stepped up its logistic support for private military contractor Wagner Group in Libya with some 338 military cargo flights from Syria in the nine months to July 31 to aid Wagner fighters backing eastern-based Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, according to a U.N. report seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
The report by independent sanctions monitors - submitted to the U.N. Security Council Libya sanctions committee, but not yet public - also found that Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Russia, and Qatar breached an arms embargo on Libya. 
The U.N. missions of Jordan, Russia, Qatar, Turkey and the UAE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusations in the report. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in January that if there are Russians in Libya, they are not representing or paid by his government. [nR4N29101F]
The U.N. report assessed ""that direct Russian Federation military logistic support to ChVK Wagner, and possibly the other Russian Federation based private military companies ... significantly increased from January 2020 to June 2020.""
It listed some 338 ""suspicious flights from Syria by Russian Federation military aircraft"" to Libya between Nov. 1, 2019 and July 31, 2020. In a confidential May report, the sanctions monitors said that Russia-based Wagner Group had up to 1,200 people deployed in Libya. [nL1N2CO16W] 
Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Since 2014, it has been split, with an internationally recognized government controlling the capital Tripoli and the northwest, while Haftar rules the east.
Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the government is backed by Turkey.
""The arms embargo remains totally ineffective,"" the U.N. report said. 
""Since the more direct engagement by Turkey in December 2019 and the United Arab Emirates in January 2020, arms transfers to Libya by those two member states have been extensive, blatant and with complete disregard to the sanctions measures,"" it said.
The report also found that Egypt, Jordan, Russia, Syria, Qatar, Turkey and the UAE breached U.N. sanctions by not inspecting ""cargo of suspicious commercial vessels or aircraft destined for Libya for which there were reasonable grounds.""

The U.N. missions of Egypt and Syria did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 04:36PM ET</span>",U.S. faces hurdles in trying to nudge Belarus toward democracy,"By Arshad Mohammed and Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hindered by frayed ties with Europe, limited leverage and doubts about President Donald Trump's devotion to democracy in Belarus, the United States is gingerly trying to nudge the former Soviet state toward new elections without provoking Russia.
Current and former U.S. officials acknowledge the challenge of promoting change in Belarus, which faces protests over an Aug. 9 election that the opposition says was rigged to extend the 26-year-old reign of President Alexander Lukashenko.
Lukashenko, who denies fraud, has responded with a violent crackdown on the protests and shown no sign of backing down despite sanctions imposed by three Baltic states on Monday and the threat of impending U.S. sanctions.
""The United States and European partners are together reviewing imposing targeted sanctions on anyone involved in human rights abuses in Belarus,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday.
A senior U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday that Washington was weighing sanctions on seven Belarusians it believes were involved in falsifying the election results and in violence against peaceful protesters. 
Belarus has responded firmly to the Baltic states, saying it will impose travel bans on officials from those countries, and warned of reciprocal measures against any other countries that hit it with sanctions.
Russian President Vladimir Putin makes no secret of his interest in Belarus, which is a conduit for Russian oil and gas to Europe and is vital to Moscow's European defence strategy, and Russia has formed a police force to back Lukashenko if necessary.
Washington wants a way to bolster democracy in Belarus that avoids Russian intervention, something which - as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun told Russian officials last week in Moscow - would further damage U.S.-Russian ties.
Biegun also visited Ukraine, which borders Belarus, and Vienna, home to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), where he promoted the regional security group that includes Belarus, European nations, Russia and the United States as a vehicle to find a solution.
""This is not a contest between East and West, and certainly not a contest between Russia and the United States,"" he said on Friday, calling for violence against protesters to stop, those ""unjustly detained"" to be freed and ""a truly free and fair election under independent observation.""
AN UPHILL STRUGGLE 
Experts said Biegun has an uphill climb.
""He has to work in the face of a lot of friction and unnecessary tension in U.S.-European relations and in the face of President Trump's own apparent ambivalence about supporting democracy,"" said Dan Fried, the former top U.S. diplomat for Europe who is now at the Atlantic Council think tank.
The Republican president, running against Democratic former vice president Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 U.S. election, has said little about Belarus, leaving some analysts with the impression he has scant interest.
""I like seeing democracy,"" he told reporters on Aug. 18. ""It doesn't seem like it's too much democracy there.""
A senior U.S. official said the United States and European Union were closely coordinating to find a way that avoids overt Russian intervention and opens ""space"" for a dialogue between the opposition and Lukashenko on transitioning from his rule.
""We are not looking to impose a solution or suggest that we need to have a seat at the table,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.
A European diplomat saw little chance for Washington and the EU to succeed via the OSCE because Belarus and Russia, as members of a group that operates by consensus, would be unlikely to go along.
Putin is sticking with Lukashenko, possibly looking to buy time for a ""managed transition"" to another leader acceptable to Russia and the opposition, said the diplomat on condition of anonymity.
Another European diplomat acknowledged the difficulty.
""I don’t think anybody is naive enough to believe that the OSCE path is going to be easy,"" he said. ""Everybody recognizes the complexity.""
GEOPOLITICAL RISKS 
Belarusian protesters have been careful not to wave EU or U.S. flags, brandishing instead the red and white flags used in Belarus after the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union until Lukashenko restored the Soviet version. 
Aware of the potential geopolitical risks, they have steered clear of being drawn into conversations about whether they want to exit Moscow’s orbit, saying they want strong relations with all countries.  
Andrew Weiss, who served on the staff of the U.S. National Security Council and is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, said ""neither the U.S. nor the EU has much leverage over Lukashenko.""

""That makes it very hard to push the Belarusian government to re-run a stolen election,"" he said. ""Putin is a master at creating leverage, which is precisely why he indicated that Russia is potentially poised to come in militarily if requested, or even if not requested.""

1384,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 04:35PM ET</span>","Mexico's environment minister resigns, president defends government's green record","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's environment minister has resigned after clashing with colleagues over policy priorities, prompting President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to defend the government's green credentials on Wednesday. 
Environment Minister Victor Manuel Toledo, an academic known for his views on sustainable agriculture and the environmental practices of Mexico's indigenous people, said his decision was due to health reasons and ""free from political implication.""
Toledo's resignation had been widely speculated since a recording was leaked in which he criticized the government's divergent views on environmental issues, specifically the use of the herbicide glyphosate by farmers. 
In a resignation speech recorded alongside the president, Toledo said Lopez Obrador was due to publish a decree in coming days prohibiting genetically modified corn and confirming that glyphosate would be phased out.
He said 80 other farm chemicals should be banned in Mexico. 
Lopez Obrador, who has been criticized for policies seen as favoring fossil fuels over renewable energy, said a giant tree-planting project, a ban on fracking and a moratorium on new mining concessions showed his government's commitment to the environment.
However, he said the welfare of human beings came before nature. 
Lopez Obrador said Toledo's decision to leave pre-dated the fight over glyphosate, which is popular with farmers.
The herbicide often sold as  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN)'s Roundup has been linked to cancer in court cases. The company has long said regulators have deemed glyphosate safe for use by humans. 
Several European countries are considering limits on its use.
Toledo, 75, will return to his prior post as a biologist at Mexico's National Autonomous University.
Welfare Minister Maria Luisa Albores will take Toledo's post and be replaced by her deputy minister, Javier May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on International Criminal Court prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, over her investigation into whether American forces committed war crimes in Afghanistan.
Pompeo also said Phakiso Mochochoko, the head of the ICC's Jurisdiction, Complementarity and Cooperation Division, had also been blacklisted under sanctions authorized by President Donald Trump in June that allow for asset freezes and travel bans.
""Today we take the next step, because the ICC continues to target Americans, sadly,"" Pompeo told reporters.
Pompeo also said that individuals and entities that continue to materially support Bensouda and Mochochoko would risk exposure to sanctions as well.
The ICC dismissed the measures as ""another attempt to interfere with the court's judicial and prosecutorial independence"" and said in a statement that it stood by the work of its staff.
""These coercive acts, directed at an international judicial institution and its civil servants, are unprecedented and constitute serious attacks against the court, the Rome Statute system of international criminal justice, and the rule of law more generally,"" it said in a rare joint statement on behalf of the entire ICC.
The State Department also restricted the issuance of visas for individuals Pompeo said were involved in the court's efforts to investigate U.S. personnel, though he did not name those affected.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was concerned by Pompeo's announcement, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters. 
Dujarric said that ""we trust that any restriction taken against individuals will be implemented consistently"" with a decades-old U.S. deal with the United Nations to host the world body's headquarters in New York.
Bensouda was given the go-ahead by the court in March to investigate whether war crimes were committed in Afghanistan by the Taliban, Afghan military and U.S. forces.
The United States revoked Bensouda's entry visa last year over the possible Afghanistan inquiry. But under an agreement between the United Nations and Washington, she was still able to regularly travel to New York to brief the U.N. Security Council on cases it had referred to the court in The Hague.
Rights groups immediately condemned the U.S. designations.
Richard Dicker, Human Rights Watch international justice director, said it was a ""stunning perversion of U.S. sanctions.""

""The Trump administration has twisted these sanctions to obstruct justice, not only for certain war crimes victims, but for atrocity victims anywhere looking to the International Criminal Court for justice,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Mississippi on Wednesday took a big step toward replacing its old state flag dominated by the Confederate ""stars and bars"" when a commission selected a new design featuring a magnolia - the state flower - to replace imagery seen by many as racist. 
The ""New Magnolia Flag,"" whose selection was announced by a Mississippi Department of Archives and History panel, now requires the approval of Governor Tate Reeves. If approved as expected, the design will go to the voters on the Nov. 3 ballot for final adoption as the state flag.
While long controversial, the old state flag - adopted in 1894 - came to its demise during the latest wave of anti-Confederate sentiment spurred by the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police.
Floyd’s killing helped revive a long-simmering conflict between those seeking to abolish Confederate statues and other images they see as symbols honoring slavery, and those who believe the symbols honor the traditions and history of the South.
Under a new Mississippi law, the state flag cannot contain the Confederate battle flag image and it must include the words ""In God We Trust,"" according to the committee's website.
“Our flag should reflect the beauty and good in all of us. It should represent a state that deserves a positive image,” the designer, Rocky Vaughan, said in a release.
“The New Magnolia Flag represents the warmth and strength of the good people of Mississippi,"" he said. ""Now is the time we show the world that we’re from Mississippi, the Magnolia State.”
The design shows the state flower on a blue background framed by red bars, with a ring of stars around it. The image was selected out of about 3,000 submissions of proposed designs from the public. It beat out a second finalist, a shield crowned with a single star on a navy blue field.

BERLIN/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who is in intensive care in a Berlin hospital, was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent in an attempt to murder him, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday.
She said Berlin now expected Moscow to explain itself and that Germany would consult its NATO allies about how to respond, raising the prospect of new Western sanctions on Russia, sending Russian asset prices tumbling.
Moscow has denied involvement in the incident and the Russian foreign ministry said Germany's assertion was not backed by evidence, complaining about the way Germany had chosen to release information about Navalny. 
""This is disturbing information about the attempted murder through poisoning against a leading Russian opposition figure,"" Merkel told a news conference. ""Alexei Navalny was the victim of an attack with a chemical nerve agent of the Novichok group.""
Novichok is the same substance that Britain said was used against a Russian double agent and his daughter in an attack in England in 2018. The deadly group of nerve agents was developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s.
Navalny, 44, is an outspoken opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has specialised in high-impact investigations into official corruption. He was airlifted to Germany last month after collapsing on a domestic Russian flight after drinking a cup of tea that his allies said was poisoned.
The White House said the use of Novichok was ""completely reprehensible,"" with the U.S. National Security Council saying on Twitter that Washington would work with allies ""to hold those in Russia accountable, wherever the evidence leads, and restrict funds for their malign activities.""
A U.S. government source familiar with U.S. intelligence reporting and analysis said the use of the Novichok family of nerve agents showed Putin was willing to be ""bold"" in targeting individuals he found threatening or irritating.
He described the attack as an assertion by the Russian leader that he is the boss and what he says goes.
The Kremlin, which has rejected any suggestion that it or the Russian state was involved, said it wanted a full exchange of information and that Germany and Russia should cooperate. But it added it was unable yet to give a proper statement about the German findings. 
Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry, told state TV that the German move looked like another fact-free information campaign against Russia. 
Russian authorities and doctors have said previously they could find no evidence Navalny was poisoned. 
Russia is already under Western sanctions after its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine six years ago. Another standoff with European nations or the United States may further hurt its economy further. 
Britain and France joined in condemning the use of Novichok, along with the European Union, which said those responsible must be brought to justice. 
NAVALNY IN SERIOUS CONDITION 
Berlin's Charite hospital, which is treating Navalny, said he remained in a serious condition in an intensive care unit connected to an artificial lung ventilator even though some of his symptoms were receding.
It said it could not rule out long-term consequences from his poisoning and that it expected him to go through a long period of illness. 
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said in a tweet that the German government's identification of the Novichok poison indicated Russian authorities were behind Navalny's poisoning.
Allies of Navalny echoed Linkevicius' view. Leonid Volkov, a Navalny aide, said on Twitter that the use of Novichok was like leaving Putin's signature at the scene of the crime.
Ivan Zhdanov, another close Navalny ally, said on Twitter that Novichok could be administered only by Russia's intelligence agencies. 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas urged Russia to investigate Navalny's poisoning now that clinical tests had shown he had been attacked with a chemical nerve agent.
""This makes it all the more urgent that those responsible in Russia be identified and held accountable,"" Maas told reporters. ""We condemn this attack in the strongest terms.""
Steffen Seibert, a German government spokesman, said earlier in an emailed statement that tests conducted at a German military laboratory had produced ""unequivocal evidence"" that Novichok had been used.

Britain says Russia used Novichok to poison former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the British city of Salisbury in 2018. Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attack, which the Skripals survived. A member of the public, 44-year-old Dawn Sturgess, was killed.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 04:16PM ET</span>",Argentina's wetlands under assault by worst fires in more than a decade,"By Cassandra Garrison and Maximilian Heath
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The worst fires in more than a decade are cutting through Argentina's vast wetlands, exacerbated by low water levels in the Parana River delta region that have exposed carbon-rich soil ripe for burning.
Infrared technology and satellite imagery have detected more hot spots, or potential fires, in the country's largest wetland during August than have been found in any other month this year, scientists said.
Rain over the last two days has quelled new hot spots, but water levels are not forecast to rise significantly along the Parana River - a major grains shipping route for port city Rosario, according to the National Institute of Water.
Wetlands play a crucial role in mitigating floods and purifying water, so their destruction is a major concern for scientists. The water-logged ecosystem is home to thousands of species, including the capybara, the world's largest rodent.
Natalia Morandeira, a wetlands biologist at the University of San Martin who has been tracking the fires using NASA data, said people living in the island communities along the banks of the Parana had lost their homes and livestock in the blaze.
Firefighters, who are often volunteers, are scarce in some areas in the delta, and residents are struggling to contain the fires themselves using buckets of water, she said.
""This is the worst situation since 2009,"" said Morandeira, adding that she had detected 16,000 new hot spots in August alone, accounting for 59% of the 26,667 detected for the whole year so far. 
Some of driest conditions in Argentina since at least 2008 have fueled the spread of the fires over the last three months, meteorologists said. 
Dry conditions in neighboring Brazil also led to a 50-year low level in the Parana River this year. In Rosario, the river was 1.16 meters on Wednesday despite recent rains, well below the September average of 2.67 meters, according to the Argentine Naval Prefecture.
The wetlands blaze coincides with fires in the grasslands and mountainous region of Cordoba province, which has also been made worse by a lack of rain.
""The fact that the vegetation and soils are so dry makes [firefighters'] work difficult. Rivers are narrow because of the drought, some streams have dried up, so fires can spread from one island to another,"" Morandeira said. 
Nearly 200,000 hectares of wetlands, an area roughly half the size of the U.S. state of Rhode Island, have been scorched, government data shows. 
When water levels are low, more land is vulnerable to burning. Organic carbon stored in the soil of the wetlands becomes exposed and acts as sort of fuel, scientists said. This makes it harder to contain the flames, which cause harmful emissions into the atmosphere when the carbon burns, they said. 
Environmental groups including Greenpeace said the fires begin when ranchers burn terrain to make way for new growth, a common annual practice in South America. Eduardo Grimaux, the president of an agriculture chamber in Entre Rios province, pushed back against the claim that farmers were to blame for the worsening spread, saying they were more likely caused by fisherman and poachers.
""There was an increase in people who come by boat from Rosario because they cannot move around the city due to a quarantine issue. So they throw garbage, make a fire, have a barbecue... it all adds up,"" Grimaux said, adding that farmers typically burn in the wetter spring months. 
Argentina has been on varying levels of coronavirus restrictions since March 20. 
A permit is required for agricultural burning, but authorities have struggled to regulate and extinguish illegal fires. The Supreme Court in August ordered creation of an environmental committee to establish fire-prevention measures the protect the wetlands. 
The fires will likely continue to burn until the wet and humid spring months arrive, according to Fabián Dayde, a volunteer fire chief in the city of Victoria on the banks of the Parana River. 

""We are in a 'stand-by' stage, waiting,"" Dayde said. ""It is not the rain that causes the end of the cycle, it's a change of seasons.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean truckers said on Wednesday they would lift a seven-day strike that has damaged supply chains and raised fears for food and commodities exports, following a deal with government. 
Jose Villagran, vice president of the National Confederation of the Chilean Cargo Transport (CNTC), said the strike would end at 3 p.m. local time.
Strikers pushed Congress to fast-track a dozen security bills after a spike in arson attacks on their vehicles which culminated in the shooting of a nine-year-old girl riding in her father's cement truck.
Villagran said the government had pledged to beef up protection for arson attack victims in Chile's restive Araucania province, with agreements on ""police intelligence"" and other, unspecified measures.
""We are going to be very attentive that what has been agreed is fulfilled because if it is not, we will return to the roads,"" he said.
Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said his government had always sympathized with the truckers' plight but blocking highways and interrupting supply chains was unacceptable. 
""The government has committed to promoting a set of measures to improve road safety and the protection of transporters and to better support the victims of terrorism,"" he said.
The deal follows a growing chorus of warnings from Chilean industry about the strike's impact on businesses and consumers.
Salmon, fruit and forestry exporters warned of products not getting to market, petrol stations said they could run dry, and supermarkets and food manufacturers raised the specter of price increases and shortages as the country struggles to shake off COVID-19.
Southern Araucania region and its surrounding provinces have for decades been mired in a conflict between the indigenous Mapuche and Chilean state which they blame for failing to uphold their historical rights in the face of industrial development.

Insurgents with links to Islamic State have stepped up attacks in Mozambique this year, alarming energy majors developing huge natural gas deposits there and governments elsewhere in southern Africa.
South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor told a parliamentary committee that southern African regional body SADC had asked Mozambique to provide a roadmap on the assistance it might need, which would then be deliberated upon before a course of action was chosen.
""If it is more intelligence support, if it is the South African navy patrolling the coast, if it is assistance from our defence force, we as South Africa stand ready, but we must have that indication from the government of Mozambique,"" Pandor said.
""Mozambique is a sovereign country, if it needs assistance from any of us it would ask for it. ... But should South Africa be jumping into Mozambique without any request from the country, without any indication as to where it needs help? I'm not sure that we can do that,"" she added.
Attacks began in the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado in 2017 but have gathered pace this year, with insurgents seizing key towns for brief periods and increasingly hitting military or strategic targets.
""The emergence of conflict in Mozambique is a worrying reversal of the peace that has characterised SADC for many years,"" Pandor said. ""Mozambique has been engaging with our various countries, and we are all looking at how we might assist them.""

The court was responding after the U.S. government moved to blacklist ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda because she had launched an investigation into whether American forces committed war crimes in Afghanistan.
The sanctions are ""unprecedented and constitute serious attacks against the Court, the Rome Statute system of international criminal justice, and the rule of law more generally,"" the world's permanent war crimes court said in a statement.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Opposition lawmakers from an Indian parliamentary panel accused Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Wednesday of favouring the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during a meeting to quiz the social media giant on its content regulation.
The IT panel, headed by lawmaker Shashi Tharoor of the opposition Congress Party, questioned Facebook's India boss Ajit Mohan for more than two hours.
It had summoned Facebook after The Wall Street Journal published a story last month saying Ankhi Das, the U.S. tech giant's Public Policy Director for South and Central Asia, had opposed the taking down of posts by a BJP politician who labelled Indian Muslims traitors.
At the hearing lawmakers from opposition parties, including the Congress, slammed Facebook for not taking down hate or inflammatory content posted by users with right-wing ideology or by accounts related to the BJP, at least six panel members told Reuters.
Mohan was told Facebook was biased toward the BJP as it received paid advertisements from government ministries, the sources said.
BJP lawmakers, on the other hand, accused Facebook of prejudice towards the Congress party, sources on the panel added.
Mohan gave the panel a presentation on Facebook's content polices, and re-affirmed the platform's neutrality, according to sources.
Facebook ""remains committed to be an open and transparent platform"", the company said in a statement issued after the meeting.
Hours before the panel hearing, a regional party governing India's West Bengal state, made public a letter which accused Facebook of being partial to the BJP, adding to the clamour of opposition voices which have been criticising the company's content regulation practices.
In a letter to Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, dated Aug. 31, West Bengal's ruling party, the Trinamool Congress, said the company's recent blocking of pages and accounts in the state pointed to the links it had with the BJP.
""There is enough material now in the public domain, including internal memos of senior Facebook management, to substantiate the bias,"" Trinamool Congress spokesman Derek O' Brien wrote in the letter.
""Please do all it takes to urgently work towards maintaining the integrity of your platform in the Indian electoral process.""
West Bengal will hold state assembly elections early next year.
On Tuesday, India's technology minister slammed Facebook for censuring content posted by users who supported right-wing ideology.
Even Facebook employees have questioned the company's content policies in India, Reuters has previously reported.
Menlo Park, California-headquartered Facebook has previously said it is a non-partisan platform and it will remove content that violates its community standards.
The hearing ended without a resolution on Wednesday and Facebook representatives will be summoned again after the panel, whose term expires on Sept. 12, is reconstituted, Tharoor told journalists.

The attack on Tuesday took place in Goldavi, close to the border with Nigeria, where some 18,000 people fleeing the violent insurgency, had sought refuge.
""We are horrified by these senseless attacks on people who have been torn from their villages, fleeing violence perpetrated by armed gangs which rage in the region, only to be stripped of safety again after they just found refuge elsewhere,"" said Olivier Guillaume Beer, UNHCR Representative in Cameroon.
The UN agency said the recent attacks follow a significant rise in violent incidents in Cameroon's Far North Region, including looting and kidnapping by Boko Haram and other armed groups active in the region.
A spokesman for Cameroon's government was not immediately available to comment. 
Suspected militants from Islamist group Boko Haram killed at least 18 people and wounded seven early last month in a grenade attack on a camp for displaced people in northern Cameroon.
The UNHCR said that an estimated 7,000 Cameroonian villagers near the border with Nigeria have fled their homes since 11 August, seeking safety in neighbouring areas. 
""The displaced population has been targeted in relentless attacks, forcing them to flee,"" it said, adding that the decade-long Boko Haram insurgency has killed over 30,000 in the Lake Chad Basin, and forced over three million to flee their homes.

Conde's candidacy has drawn fierce criticism from his opponents, who say he is violating term limits. They called for fresh protests after his party announced on Monday that he had accepted its nomination to run.
Demonstrations over the past year - both before and after a March constitutional referendum - killed at least 30 people. Conde says the new constitution acts as a reset button on the two-term limit, entitling him to two more six-year terms. 
""We can't do anything in Guinea without women. I will be the candidate of young people and women,"" Conde told a video conference of female political activists on Wednesday. 
Conde, 82, was a leading opponent of Lansana Conte, who ruled Guinea after coming to power in a 1984 coup until his death in 2008. Conde was first elected president in 2010, raising hopes for democratic progress.
His opponents, however, accuse him of cracking down on dissent and following in the footsteps of other African leaders who have altered constitutions in order to stay in power. 
Neighbouring Ivory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara will also stand for a third term in October, relying on a recent change to that country's constitution. 
Conde's supporters say he needs more time in office to pursue his agenda of modernising the country, Africa's largest producer of the main aluminium ore, bauxite. 
France's foreign ministry said on Tuesday it was concerned about possible violence during the election in its former colony, but stopped short of criticising Conde's decision to run again.

Libya's internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) declared the ceasefire last month and called for a lifting of a seven-month blockade on oil facilities. The leader of a rival parliament to the east, Aguila Saleh, also appealed for a halt to hostilities.
Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) dismissed the ceasefire as a marketing stunt, saying rival forces were mobilizing around front lines in Sirte and Jufra, strategic areas for both sides.
Turkey has provided military support to Fayez al-Serraj's GNA, helping reverse the LNA's 14-month assault on Tripoli in June. Haftar's LNA is supported by Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. 
Eastern parliamentary leader Saleh is seen to have gained clout relative to Haftar since the LNA's retreat from Tripoli.
""We see there are points by Serraj and Saleh that are good points, like lifting the (oil) embargo, but there are some issues with the statements as well,"" Oktay told an online panel, referring to differing calls for demilitarized zones in Sirte and Jufra.
""Saleh has tried to somehow reach an agreement and Haftar has already rejected it. If it goes through, we would love it, but unfortunately there are many doubts. Unfortunately, there are huge military accumulations by countries supporting Haftar.""
Both sides and their foreign patrons have been mobilizing around the central city of Sirte, though there has been little fighting in recent weeks. The sides have also accused each other of quickly violating truces and using them to rearm.
Last week, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said Turkey wanted talks between the warring parties to resume. ""We support the ceasefire and the disarmament of the Sirte-Jufra line on the condition that Libya is not divided,"" he said.
The United Nations has been coordinating international efforts for military, political and economic deals in Libya following a summit in January in Berlin. Ankara and Moscow have also been holding talks on a ceasefire, with Turkish officials going to Moscow for discussions on Monday.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",Who took centre stage on Lebanon's centenary? A French man,"By Ghaida Ghantous
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon marked its centenary this week and one man dominated broadcasts from planting a cedar tree, the Middle East state's national emblem, to visiting Beirut's devastated port.
But it wasn't a powerful Lebanese leader or a local celebrity. Instead, the wall-to-wall coverage on Tuesday was of Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, the nation from which Lebanon shook off the shackles of colonial rule decades ago.
It is a sign of the depth of Lebanon's crisis and the disdain so many Lebanese now have for their politicians -- whether Muslim, Christian or Druze -- that there was little sign of complaint that a foreigner and leader of a former colonial power took centre stage.
""I promise you, I won't leave you,"" Macron told a group of anti-government protesters after making his first stop on Monday at the home of Fairouz, 85, the famed Lebanese singer whose music for decades has transcended Lebanon's sectarian divides.
Lebanon's economy is collapsing after years of industrial-scale state corruption, the currency has crashed and, after last month's massive port blast, a swathe of Beirut is ruined.
The Lebanese are reeling. A growing number cannot afford to feed their families, while others are planning to leave for good - or already have. Many of those who want to stay or have no choice are desperate for someone to drag them out of the crisis.
Enter Macron, on his second visit in less than a month.
""The scene was 100% French. Macron dominated it entirely in an unprecedented manner for a foreign leader,"" Nabil Boumonsef, deputy editor-in-chief of Annahar newspaper, told Reuters.
""At some points, he was sharp and severe with the political class, even threatening sanctions, and they didn't object because they sense that they have been denounced and no longer have legitimacy.""
The borders of modern Lebanon were proclaimed by France in 1920 after an imperial carve up with Britain. The nation gained its independence in 1943.
But the country, with its deep sectarian rifts, has long been a political playground for regional and international powers, from which local warlords - some still with political influence - have been all too ready to take support to fight proxy wars or settle their local squabbles.
This time, even politicians, who might in steadier times have come out with furious speeches about foreign meddling, lined up to meet Macron as he told them to fix the system in double quick time.
Reform or face the consequences, possibly sanctions, he warned. And as one senior Lebanese politician told Reuters the next day, this time, after so many delays, ""it might work.""
So on Tuesday, it was the French air force that flew over head -- trailing smoke in Lebanon's colours of red, white and green -- and it was the French president, with his jacket off and sleeves rolled up at Beirut port, telling Lebanon he hadn't lost hope and it was time to get on with the job of cleaning up.

Some 70 resupply flights had landed in eastern airports in support of the Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar since July 8, Stephanie Williams (NYSE:WMB) told the U.N. Security Council. 
In the same period, 30 flights and nine cargo ships had carried materiel to western Libya to assist the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli. 
She did not name the countries involved. The LNA is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt, while the GNA is backed by Turkey. 
The conflict has fed into a wider tussle for influence among those countries in the eastern Mediterranean area. Williams warned that any reckless action ""risks igniting large-scale confrontation, with the devastating consequences this would entail for the country and the region at large"". 
Libya's conflict and a blockade on oil exports by eastern forces have worsened living conditions amid a rapid surge in the coronavirus in some parts of the country, with the number of confirmed cases doubling over the past two weeks to 15,156. 
""Exponential increases are a worrying trend with community transmission now reported in some of Libya's main cities,"" Williams said, adding that the true scale of the pandemic in Libya was likely far higher than recorded numbers showed. 
""Nearing full collapse after more than nine years of conflict, the health care system is unable to respond,"" she said.

With the new academic year starting next week, the Madrid region is screening all its teachers for coronavirus antibodies, with further tests for those with a positive result. 
But the program got off to a rocky start, as footage from the EFE news agency showed hundreds of people queuing around the block outside the Virgen de la Paloma school in the northwest of the city, with little space to observe social distancing. 
A spokeswoman for the regional education department said the center was shut at around 2 p.m., and those who missed their test would be given a new appointment later this week. 
Five other centers across the Madrid region continued to operate normally throughout the day, she added.
Along with mandatory mask use for children over six and a strict hand-washing regimen, authorities hope the testing will ensure a safe return to school and assuage the fears of concerned parents. 
""To be honest I'm scared. My grandchildren are going to school and I'm scared that they might get infected,"" said Olga Morocho, an Ecuadorean living in the Spanish capital. 
Madrid is at the center of Spain's second wave of COVID-19 infections, with 467 cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, more than double the country's average of 212 per 100,000 - itself the highest rate in western Europe.
The latest national data show infections peaked between Aug. 21 and Aug. 28 when more than 9,000 cases were recorded on five days, before slowing again.
A total of 479,554 cases have been diagnosed since February, while 10 deaths were recorded in the past 24 hours, bringing the cumulative toll up to 29,194.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Students at Hungary's University of Theatre and Film Arts have sealed entrances to the building to stop the new board of trustees getting in, and pledged to maintain the blockade until demands for autonomy from government control were met.
The prestigious institution, which nurtured many of Hungary's most famous directors and film makers over the past 155 years, has been caught up in a culture war as Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government expands its control over universities, research institutions and the media.
Some of Orban's supporters say they want to end what they view as the domination of the arts in Hungary by liberals.
""We will stay until our demands are met, and guarantees for autonomy are set in writing,"" student leader Mihaly Csernai told reporters on Wednesday in front of the university whose doors have been taped off. About 100 students have set up camp inside.
The university's management resigned on Monday in protest after the government appointed a board of five trustees, rejecting members proposed by the university.
The school's senate has also been stripped of its right to decide on key budgetary and organisational matters.
Some prominent directors have resigned from their teaching positions, including Hungarian film maker and screenwriter Ildiko Enyedi, whose 2017 film ""On Body and Soul"" won the top prize at the Berlin International Film Festival.
It was also nominated for an Academy Award.
In a statement to her students she said she had ""foolishly hoped that common sense and respect for university traditions carried a weight and university autonomy would remain"", but that those hopes had evaporated.
Talks between the former management of the university and the new board ended in a stalemate on Wednesday. 
Theatre director Attila Vidnyanszky, chairman of the new board, told ATV television on Tuesday that the trustees were open to dialogue with the university.
But he also said he wanted to introduce a ""different kind of thinking"" while keeping existing classes, placing some emphasis on patriotism and Christianity.

The government denies any attempt to limit freedom of expression. It has said the fact that some universities will be governed by a board of trustees will actually eliminate state influence over them.

MUMBAI/ NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The death of a Tibetan member of an Indian special forces unit in a mine blast near the site of a border flare-up with Chinese troops has offered a rare glimpse into a little-known group of elite, high-altitude warriors.
Tenzin Nyima, 53, was killed and another commando critically wounded in the blast near the shores of the Pangong Tso lake in the western Himalayas, three Indian government officials and two members of his family told Reuters.
Indian and Chinese forces came close to direct confrontation in the area over the weekend over competing territorial claims, their governments have said.
Nyima was part of the Special Frontier Force (SFF), his family and three Indian government officials said.
The force recruits mostly from Tibetan refugees, hundreds of thousands of whom have made India their home since the Dalai Lama fled Tibet following a failed uprising in 1959. Some are Indian citizens.
Few details are publicly known about the covert force set up soon after a war between India and China in 1962. Two officials estimated its strength at more than 3,500 men.
Amitabh Mathur, a former Indian government adviser on Tibetan affairs, said the SFF were ""crack troops, especially in the context of mountain climbing and high-altitude warfare.
""If at all they (SFF) were deployed, I am not surprised. It makes sense to deploy them at high altitudes. They are terrific mountain climbers and commandos.""
India's defense and home ministries did not respond to a request for comment on the SFF.
China has long considered the presence of a large number of Tibetans in India as a threat to its territorial integrity. They are led by Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing denounces as a dangerous separatist.
He says he only wants genuine autonomy for his remote Himalayan homeland.
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news briefing on Wednesday she did not know whether Tibetans were fighting for India, but urged caution.
""We are firmly opposed to any country, including India, supporting the secession activities of Tibetan pro-independence forces or providing them with any assistance or physical space,"" she said.
TIBETANS SEEK RECOGNITION
Within the Tibetan community, grieving has begun over Nyima's death, video footage taken by the family and shared with Reuters shows.
His body was kept in a coffin covered with Indian and Tibetan flags in a refugee colony in Choglamsar village of India's Ladakh region.
Two bereaved relatives and two neighbors of Nyima told Reuters that an Indian government official who delivered the coffin told them that Nyima died ""while defending India"".
The official requested that the family refrain from speaking about Nyima's 33-year service with the SFF, the relatives said, requesting anonymity as they feared the Indian government might act against them.
The defense ministry and home ministry did not immediately respond to questions about the relatives' account.
Photographs of the coffin and the Tibetan mourning rituals were circulated on WhatsApp groups run by Tibetan refugees in Leh, the main city in Ladakh, and in Dharamshala in northern India, the seat of the self-styled Tibetan government-in-exile.
Some wanted greater recognition for the Tibetans' service to India.
""We respect and love India for giving us shelter but it is time the nation acknowledges the crucial role played by our men in the SFF,"" Lhagyari Namgyal Dolkar, a 34-year-old lawmaker of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile, told Reuters.
""If an Indian soldier dies, the country declares him as a martyr, government pays rich tribute. Why are Tibetan refugees not bestowed the same respect?"" said Dolkar, whose uncle fought alongside Indian soldiers against Pakistan in 1999.
A senior Indian military official said the SFF had played a pivotal role in the 1971 war with Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh as well as a near-war with Pakistan again in 1999 over the Kargil heights.

The prime minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile, Lobsang Sangay, said his ""government does not comment on the SFF"".

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A French roadmap for Lebanon's next government calls for the immediate resumption of talks with the International Monetary Fund to fix the shattered economy and swift moves to fight graft and introduce other reforms that have been delayed for years.
The draft program was reviewed by Reuters on Wednesday, a day after French President Emmanuel Macron on a visit to Beirut delivered a stark message to Lebanon's leaders: deliver on reforms by the end of October or face sanctions.
Macron, whose pressure prompted Lebanon's bickering leaders to agree on a new prime minister, has spearheaded international efforts to set Lebanon on a new course after decades of corrupt rule led to its deepest crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.
Lebanon's banks are paralyzed, its currency has crashed and sectarian tensions are rising. On top of that, a huge port blast last month smashed a swathe of Beirut, killing more than 190 people and causing damage estimated at up to $4.6 billion.
Reuters obtained the draft, which lays down detailed demands in line with Macron's call for ""credible commitments"", from two Lebanese officials. It was also reported by Lebanese media.
The French presidency and Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Within 15 days of taking office, Lebanon's new government should have set out a timeframe for IMF talks, the draft says.
Within a month, it must implement an IMF-approved capital control law, start auditing the central bank and launch reforms to the electricity sector, which still cannot provide the nation of about 6 million people with 24-hour power.
Also within a month, it should scrap current plans to build a controversial power station in Selaata, north of Beirut, and set up a national anti-corruption authority. 
Mustapha Adib, the former ambassador to Germany, was designated prime minister hours before Macron arrived. Before taking up the post, he must secure approval for his cabinet, which usually takes months. Macron set a two-week deadline.
""The challenges are overwhelming and cannot bear delay,"" Adib said after meeting politicians on Wednesday.
'SET OF SPOILS'
Lebanon's talks with the IMF were launched in May but stalled in July as the government argued with the political parties and banks about the scale of losses in the banking system, which had largely funded a mountain of public debt.
Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said the reforms would be a challenge for the political elite as it would make it tough to finance their networks of influence.
""It shifts politics from the old regime, which looks at public services as a set of spoils, into a new economy in which the old practices cannot go on,"" he said.
But a senior political source said parties were making some concessions, partly due to French pressure. ""It is ambitious but with (Macron) coaching Lebanon, it might work,"" the source said.
While Macron has led international diplomacy on Lebanon, other powers still have considerable sway, such as Iran via its ally the heavily armed Muslim Shi'ite party Hezbollah.
Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional rival, has exercised influence over Lebanon's Sunnis and the United States, which lists Hezbollah as a terrorist group, is a major donor.
Hezbollah official Mahmoud Qamati told Hezbollah's al-Manar TV he saw regional and international cooperation over Lebanon. ""Therefore this is an opportunity for this government to solve some of the crises at least, if not all of them,"" he said. 
The Lebanese Forces, a Christian party staunchly opposed to Hezbollah, said expert ministers in the new government must act independently without having to consult a political master, unlike the previous cabinet now acting as caretaker.
Gebran Bassil, head of the biggest Christian party, the Hezbollah-allied Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), said ""if this government does not succeed it means we are going towards a bigger catastrophe"".

GRAN CANARIA, Spain (Reuters) - Spain's coast guard rescued three boatloads of migrants from waters off Gran Canaria on Wednesday, bringing them ashore to join another 150 people forced to camp on the dockside as officials struggle to cope with a months-long migratory surge.
The latest group of 58 North African men were plucked from three small boats drifting around 29 km (18 miles) to the south of the island and appeared to be in good health, the coast guard said. 
Upon arrival, they were ushered ashore by health officials in white coveralls, goggles and respirators.
With migrant reception centres across the archipelago stretched to capacity, more than 200 people from across Africa, including two women, are now stuck in the makeshift camp in Gran Canaria's Arguineguin port. 
Some of them queued up to receive drinks, snacks and hand sanitizer from volunteers, while others sprawled out on blankets on the concrete floor.
Asked what the government's plan for the migrants was, a spokeswoman responded: ""We're working on it,"" without providing further details.
Although seaborne migration to Spain is down nearly 27% this year, arrivals to the Canaries have surged five-fold to 3,448, interior-ministry data shows, putting a strain on local authorities.

Analysts have suggested that beefed-up security in the Mediterranean is pushing more people to risk the perilous crossing to the Canaries, located around 60 miles to the west of Morocco's Atlantic Coast.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States had decided to cut $100 million in aid to Ethiopia amid a dispute with Egypt and Sudan over a megadam that Ethiopia is building on the Nile, a congressional source told Reuters on Wednesday. 
Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt have been locked in a bitter dispute over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which remains unresolved although the reservoir behind the dam began filling in July.
""State has decided to cut assistance"" due to Ethiopia’s position on GERD negotiations, the source told Reuters via email. ""Up to $100M or so will be affected, of which $26M is funding that expires at the end of the (financial year),"" the email said.
The source said much of the expiring funding deals with regional security or border security, political competition and consensus-building, and nutrition. 
But funding for HIV/AIDS, the food for peace program, international disaster assistance, and migration and refugee assistance would be unaffected, the official said.
The Ethiopian foreign ministry was not immediately available for comment. 
The United States and Ethiopia have long been close allies, with Ethiopia often working in tandem with the U.S. officials against Somali Islamist insurgents. 
But U.S. officials have been frustrated by their inability to strike a deal. Ethiopia says the $4 billion dam will generate electricity and help lift its population of 109 million people out of poverty. 
The dam, when finished, will have an installed capacity of 6,450 megawatts - more than doubling Ethiopia's existing capacity - and is the centerpiece of the country's bid to become Africa's biggest power exporter.
But Egypt relies the Nile for more than 90% of its fresh water supplies and fears the dams will exacerbate existing shortages.
Negotiations have previously faltered over a demand from Egypt and Sudan that any deal should be legally binding, over the mechanism for resolving future disputes, and over how to manage the dam during periods of reduced rainfall or drought.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday it would now require senior Chinese diplomats to get State Department approval before visiting U.S. university campuses and holding cultural events with more than 50 people outside mission grounds.
Washington cast the move as a response to what it said was Beijing's restrictions on American diplomats based in China. It comes as part of a Trump administration campaign against alleged Chinese influence operations and espionage activity.
The State Department said it also would take action to help ensure all Chinese embassy and consular social media accounts were ""properly identified.""
""We're simply demanding reciprocity. Access for our diplomats in China should be reflective of the access that Chinese diplomats in the United States have, and today's steps will move us substantially in that direction'"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a news briefing.
It was the latest U.S. step to restrict Chinese activity in the United States in the run-up to the November presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy platform.
Pompeo also said Keith Krach, the State Department's undersecretary for Economic Growth, had written recently to the governing boards of U.S. universities alerting them to threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party.
""These threats can come in the form of illicit funding for research, intellectual property theft, intimidation of foreign students and opaque talent recruitment efforts,"" Pompeo said.
He said universities could ensure they had clean investments and endowment funds, ""by taking a few key steps to disclose all (Chinese) companies' investments invested in the endowment funds, especially those in emerging-market index funds.""
On Tuesday, Pompeo said he was hopeful Chinese Confucius Institute cultural centers on U.S. university campuses, which he accused of working to recruit ""spies and collaborators,"" would all be shut by the end of the year.
Last month, Pompeo labeled the center that manages the dozens of Confucius Institutes in the United States ""an entity advancing Beijing's global propaganda and malign influence"" and required it to register as a foreign mission.
The State Department announced in June it would start treating four major Chinese media outlets as foreign embassies, calling them mouthpieces for Beijing.

It took the same step against five other Chinese outlets in February, and in March said it was slashing the number of journalists allowed to work at U.S. offices of major Chinese media outlets to 100 from 160 due to Beijing's ""long-standing intimidation and harassment of journalists.""

GAZA/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - A difference between English and Arabic versions of a trilateral statement after an historic flight from Israel to the UAE has been seized upon by Palestinians to suggest the Gulf state has overstated Israeli readiness to drop West Bank annexation plans.
The English version of a joint communiqué by the United Arab Emirates, Israel and the United States in Abu Dhabi on Monday said the accord had ""led to the suspension of Israel's plans to extend its sovereignty"".
But the Arabic version, carried by the UAE state news agency WAM, said ""the agreement ... has led to Israel's plans to annex Palestinian lands being stopped"". 
The discrepancy was highlighted by Palestinians after President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner flew with U.S. and Israeli delegations on the first Israeli commercial flight to the UAE to cement the normalisation accord, the first by a Gulf state. 
""Compare yourself the two versions... suspension of extending sovereignty, not stopping annexation of Palestinian lands,"" tweeted Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation on Tuesday.
The UAE has portrayed the accord, announced by Trump on Aug. 13, as a means to halt Israeli annexation of occupied West Bank lands, where Palestinian hope to build a future state.
Jamal Al-Musharakh, chief of policy planning and international cooperation at the UAE foreign ministry, said the difference in wording was merely a translation issue.
""If anyone can think of a better synonym than 'Eeqaf' (stopping) for 'suspending', then please let me know,"" he told reporters.
""One of the prerequisites of the commencing of bilateral relations was the halting of the annexation,” said Musharakh. The Emirati government did not respond when asked for further comment.
But Hanan Ashrawi, a senior PLO official, said it was a ""forked tongue"" attempt to influence public opinion in the Arab world.
""NO CHANGE IN MY PLAN""
""I don't think it is a problem of translation, I think it is a disingenuous way of trying to manipulate the discourse,"" she told Reuters.
""The Arabic translation is a way of misleading Arab public opinion by saying they have succeeded in stopping the annexation, while actually they suspended it.""
In recent election campaigns Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to apply Israeli sovereignty to West Bank areas, including Jewish settlements, but said he needed a green light from Washington.
Speaking in Hebrew and using the biblical terms for the West Bank, Netanyahu told Israelis on Aug. 13 - the day the deal was announced: ""There is no change in my plan to apply our sovereignty in Judea and Samaria, in full coordination with the United States. I am committed, it has not changed.""
Keeping annexation hopes alive is widely seen as Netanyahu's attempt to placate his right-wing voter base. Settler leaders have accused him of repeatedly floating annexation, only to cave in to international pressure.
An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokeswoman on Wednesday said it had nothing to add to the original Aug 13. statement, which said: ""As a result of this diplomatic breakthrough ...Israel will suspend declaring sovereignty over areas outlined in the President's Vision for Peace.""
The White House declined to comment on the UAE trip communique, but a U.S. source familiar with the matter said the White House was not responsible for the Arabic translation.
At the briefing to reporters in Washington after the Aug 13 announcement Trump said annexation was ""right now off the table,"" and U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman added: ""The word suspend was chosen carefully by all the parties. 'Suspend' by definition, look it up, means a temporary halt. It's off the table now but it's not off the table permanently.""
During his UAE trip this week Kushner also used the word ""suspend"". 
""Israel has agreed to suspend the annexation, to suspend applying Israeli law to those areas for the time being,"" he told the WAM agency. ""But in the future it is a discussion that I am sure will be had. But not in the near future.""

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Russia's Navalny - Putin's nemesis and crusader against graft,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Alexei Navalny has been the biggest thorn in the Kremlin's side for more than a decade, persistently detailing what he says is high-level graft and mobilizing crowds of young protesters in a country where the opposition has no meaningful power.
The 44-year-old lawyer, in a coma in a Berlin hospital after what Germany says was a poisoning with a Soviet Novichok nerve agent, has never challenged President Vladimir Putin at the ballot box but is the highest-profile leader of Russia's deeply divided government opponents.
Part of a new generation prepared to take to the streets to make their views heard, he came to prominence when demonstrations against Putin took off in December 2011, 12 years after the former KGB officer first came to power.
Navalny was one of the first protest leaders arrested and, after 15 days in jail for obstructing police, he emerged a hero, with protesters chanting his name at demonstrations and giving his booming, rousing speeches the biggest cheers.
By the time the protests started to fade in the spring of 2012, Putin was back in the Kremlin as president while Navalny had established himself as the largely undisputed leader of an opposition operating mostly outside official structures.
That pre-eminence has faded amid internal policy differences and squabbling among various factions, and some other opposition figures have questioned how far his support extends beyond Russia's big cities.
He has been repeatedly detained for organizing public meetings and rallies and sued over the detailed investigations into corruption which he posts on his YouTube channel, gaining millions of views. 
He was barred from running in a presidential election in 2018, and jailed last summer after calling for mass opposition protests in Moscow, which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets. 
His anti-corruption foundation has been found guilty of violating a ""foreign agent"" law and he was convicted of corruption by Russian authorities in 2013. His supporters say it and other cases against him are politically motivated.
""Putin is very angry and is stamping his feet,"" he said last year after police raided the homes and offices of his supporters across Russia in what they said was an investigation into money laundering at his foundation.
Four days earlier, he had led a tactical voting campaign that dented the ruling party's hold on Moscow's city assembly.
Navalny was born on June 4, 1976, the son of an army officer, and grew up mainly in Obninsk, about 100 km (60 miles) southwest of Moscow.
After a law degree, he spent time in the United States on a fellowship at Yale, which pro-Kremlin critics have seized on as evidence that he is a foreign agent.
In 2007, he was expelled from Russia's liberal Yabloko opposition party for nationalist views, which he has since toned down.

He also studied securities and exchanges and bought small stakes in some of Russia's biggest companies to demand greater transparency for shareholders and the public.

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 11:31AM ET</span>","Belarus to hit Baltics with sanctions, Russia steps up support","By Andrew Osborn and Maria Kiselyova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Belarus will impose travel bans on senior officials in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in retaliation for measures targeting its own officials, the foreign minister said on Wednesday, as Russia stepped up support for the Belarusian government. 
More than three weeks after a political crisis erupted in Belarus over allegations of vote rigging in a presidential election which incumbent Alexander Lukashenko said he had won, Minsk and close ally Moscow are pushing back hard against Lukashenko's domestic and foreign critics.
In Moscow for talks with his Russian counterpart, Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei said his country had agreed to impose retaliatory sanctions on a list of individuals in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.
The move was pay back, he said, after the three Baltic countries on Monday said they were imposing travel bans on Lukashenko and 29 other Belarusian officials to punish them for their role in the alleged vote-rigging and in a crackdown against protesters.
Makei declined to say who was on the sanctions list, but said it targeted individuals who had tried to interfere in his country's internal affairs, made what he called unacceptable political statements, and spoken of funding the opposition. 
""For us this is absolutely unacceptable,"" he said, warning Minsk would impose sanctions on any other countries who put sanctions on Belarus. 
The European Union has been working on a list of individuals to target with sanctions but is expected to exclude Lukashenko.
RUSSIAN SUPPORT
Standing alongside Makei, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov offered Lukashenko strong support and said Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin would visit Belarus for talks on Thursday. 
Moscow would respond ""firmly and with dignity"" to any attempts to destabilize Belarus or loosen its strong ties to Russia, he said. 
Lavrov condemned what he said was meddling in Belarus by outside forces, alleging that 200 trained Ukrainian extremists were inside Belarus trying to destabilize it, an accusation Kyiv said was fictitious.
Lavrov also accused NATO and the European Union of making ""destructive"" statements about Belarus. He said Moscow saw no point in engaging with the Belarusian opposition council that has emerged amid nationwide anti-government protests.
Complaining about what he described as an initial anti-Russian statement from the council, he accused it of breaking the law by calling on law enforcement forces to switch sides.
The council's leaders have said repeatedly that they are only interested in trying to bring about a peaceful transition of power.
In another sign of Russian support, the chiefs of staff of the Russian and Belarusian armies discussed preparations for a joint military drill in Belarus this year ahead of a visit by the Belarusian defense minister to Moscow on Friday. 

Lukashenko has also thanked Russian state-backed television channel RT for sending journalists to help prop up Belarusian state media after some staff members went on strike in protest against his rule.

1409,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",Italy minister's embrace of 'Blackface' memes spotlights racism,"By Crispian Balmer and Angelo Amante
ROME (Reuters) - For Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio it was a bit of harmless, social media fun, for others it highlighted what some say is a national blindness to insidious racism lurking just under the skin of predominantly white Italy. 
When Di Maio appeared last week sporting a strikingly deep sun tan, a wave of memes hit the internet showing his face superimposed onto the bodies of prominent Black figures.
At a time when the Black Lives Matter mantra is resonating across much of the world, such imagery would be viewed as an anathema in many countries. But rather than condemn the posts, Di Maio made them his own by putting a selection on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
One of the pictures showed him as U.S. basketball great Michael Jordan, another placed his face over that of one of Bill Cosby's children in the U.S. sitcom ""The Cosby Show"", in what was seen as Di Maio adopting a digitized form of Blackface.
""Guys. I promise that next summer I'll wear factor 50 suntan cream. And thank you for making my day lighter,"" Di Maio wrote, ending his post with an emoji of a laughing face.
It wasn't a laughing matter for everyone.
""What is funny about the color of my skin?"" said Igiaba Scego, an Italian-Somali author who lives in Rome. ""This came from the foreign minister. He should be setting an example. Instead he minimized something that is clearly racist.""
Traditionally a nation of emigrants, Italy has only become a major destination for immigrants since the start of the 21st century and there has been relatively little debate here over the country's colonial past, racism or integration.
Blackface began in New York vaudeville shows in the 1830s, when slavery was still legal in the U.S. South, and featured white performers who darkened their faces to caricature blacks on plantations as lazy and stupid. Its usage today in the English-speaking world is synonymous with racism.
A chastened Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had to fight for his political life last year after pictures emerged of him with his face blackened at a 2001 fancy dress party.
While Di Maio, a 32-year-old leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, did not physically blacken his face, critics like Scego said the digital imagery was pungent. 
Tellingly, in a nation renown for its ruthless politics, Di Maio's many rivals did not look to capitalize on the post. On the contrary, one of his fiercest foes - the conservative daily Il Giornale - defended him from accusations of racism.
""It seems incredible to write it here, but if we have to choose between the innocent freedom to joke about a tan and the Orwellian totalitarianism of stupid censors in search of imaginary racism, then we back Di Maio,"" the paper said in a front page editorial on Saturday.
Contacted by Reuters, Di Maio did not respond to a request for comment on the issue.
MUSSOLINI MONUMENTS
Rights activist Tareke Brhane, an Italian citizen originally from Eritrea, said such ""jokes"" were commonplace here. ""You are discriminated because of your skin color. You have to deal with this for the rest of your life,"" he said. 
Unlike other European countries, Italy remains an overwhelmingly white, Roman Catholic country.
Just 8.8% of Italy's 60 million registered residents are foreigners and of these, less than half a million come from sub-Saharan Africa. Latest estimates suggest there are also some 560,000 migrants without official papers living here, kept on the margins of society by their inability to join the workforce.
Such numbers might go some way to explain a generalized lack of sensitivity around race issues.
While the killing of George Floyd by a U.S. policeman in May triggered large demonstrations around the world in support of the Black Lives Matter cause, the response in Italy was muted.
The movement also led to a renewed focus on Europe's colonial abuses, especially in Britain and Belgium where the statues of some historical figures were toppled.
In Italy, students threw red paint over the statue of a journalist, Indro Montanelli, who once admitted, without any remorse, that he had bought a 12-year-old Eritrean girl as a wife during Italy's colonial rule there in the 1930s. 
But monuments built to honor one of the country's most enthusiastic colonialists, fascist leader Benito Mussolini, remain unscathed.
Historian Francesco Perfetti, a professor at Luiss University in Rome, says the push for colonialism started late in Italy compared with other European nations and left little impact on the nation's psyche.
""In the mind of the Italians there is not even the perception of having been a colonial state,"" he told Reuters.
As a country which saw millions of its citizens emigrate in the 19th and 20th centuries in search of a better life, Perfetti believes Italians are more tolerant of migrants than elsewhere.
""The Italian nature is not racist while in American history it is an endemic, profound phenomenon,"" he said.
Scego, who was born in Rome in 1974, says Italians need to be taught about the crimes the country committed in Ethiopia, Somalia, Libya and Eritrea, and be made more aware of the importance of integration.

""Much work still needs to be done here,"" she said. ""It is a strange country. I love it, but it needs to move forward and see what is happening in the rest of the world.""

1410,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 11:01AM ET</span>",Top EU schools see applications dip as COVID compounds Brexit delays,"By Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has forced some British-based families to put Brexit-related plans to move to the European Union on hold, leaving some top international schools wondering when a predicted surge in new applications will materialize.
Thousands of staff - and their school-age children - could relocate from London as financial firms reorganize to maintain a presence in the European single market, and this had been expected to benefit schools in the region.
But as the new academic year begins, three of the most prestigious institutions in the EU said they had yet to see a landslide in enrolment requests from UK-based families before Britain finally cuts ties with the bloc on Dec. 31.
""The double impact of COVID-19 and Brexit is impacting the way globally mobile families approach relocation,"" Caroline MacDonald, Director of Advancement at the American School of Paris (ASP), told Reuters.
""While some of our families arrived in France soon after Brexit was announced, there's not been a marked increase in families rushing to move before the end of the transition period,"" she said.
The American School of Paris, which teaches an American curriculum to students aged 3-18, and where fees range from 19,000 to 35,150 euros per year, welcomed just eight new students from Britain when its campus reopened on Aug. 26.
This reflected a dip in applications from families linked to embassies, institutions such as the European Banking Authority, and private firms in France.
The slower-than-expected pace of enrolment has also been seen in Frankfurt and Amsterdam, where several global financial firms and EU institutions such as the European Medicines Agency have moved from Britain.
Some employers may also be reluctant to support pricey fees.
""We've found a lot of children of families educated in the UK and then relocated to Amsterdam have been subject to financial restrictions on school options they could go for,"" said Paul Morgan, head of the British School of Amsterdam.
The British School of Amsterdam - where annual fees range from 15,840 to 16,980 euros - still has vacancies in its infant school, according to its website as at Sept. 1.
NO HURRY TO MOVE
One source at a major international bank said it was giving staff ""as long as possible"" to relocate to avoid unnecessary disruption.
But global banks in Britain are under pressure from European regulators to move key staff to their new EU hubs without delay, despite COVID-19.
Paul Fochtman, Head of the Frankfurt International School (FIS), said his institution, whose staff and students represent more than 50 nationalities and where annual fees range between 20,730 and 25,700 euros, is still waiting for a Brexit applications boom.
He said some Brexit-related relocations due to happen in the 2019/2020 academic year were put on hold due to COVID, and the rate of Brexit-linked applications to the school for the 2020/2021 year also declined compared to pre-COVID levels.
Around 10 students planning to join the FIS from Britain in August had deferred their arrival until January, with a few of those potentially deferring again until August 2021. 
Fochtman said demand for places from families of other nationalities moving to Germany instead of Britain was on the rise, offsetting the smaller numbers of UK-to-EU applications also seen in Paris and Amsterdam.
Some 40% of the new enrolment at the ASP this year was from families moving to France from around Europe, MacDonald said.

""We haven't seen that huge surge that you might have imagined after Brexit, when we were all thinking about what might happen. I can't tell you that we have seen any bigger demand than in previous years,"" Morgan said.

KOPER, Slovenia (Reuters) - A burnt wooden statue of Slovenian-born U.S. First Lady Melania Trump, described by the artist as representing tensions in the United States, goes on show at an art gallery in the Slovenian seaside town of Koper on Wednesday. 
The statue was torched by unknown perpetrators while on show in the open air near her birth place Sevnica, on July 4, celebrated as Independence Day in the United States.
""This object (the burnt statue) somehow represents a visual representation of political tensions that are erupting in my country and not only in my country,"" Berlin-based American artist Brad Downey told Reuters.
The 40-year-old had commissioned the life-sized piece from a Slovenian folk artist Ales Zupevc. Trump was born in Slovenia in 1970 when it was still a part of communist Yugoslavia. 
The First Lady's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Also on show are a plastic replica of the wooden sculpture and moulds used to make a bronze statue of Trump that is due to be unveiled in Rozno near Sevnica next week, in the spot where the wooden statue used to stand.
Downey said the statue was torched at a time when a number of statues of colonialists were destroyed in the U.S. as a part of the ""Black Lives Matter"" protests.
Downey said he created the Melania statues in order to inspire a dialogue on the political situation in his country that has a president sworn to reducing immigration although he is married to an immigrant.

Although the Melania wooden statue's face was rough-hewn and did not bear her facial features before it was damaged, the figure wears a pale blue coat like the one she wore at Donald Trump's inauguration as U.S. president.

Russia's Supreme Court branded the Jehovah's Witnesses an ""extremist"" organization in 2017 and ordered it to disband. Since then the authorities have detained dozens of Jehovah's Witnesses and convicted them on extremism charges.
Vadim Levchuk and Sergei Britvin, who were detained in 2018 in the Siberian town of Beryozovsky, nearly 3,000 kilometers (1,860 miles) east of Moscow, will appeal against their jail sentence, the group said.
Jarrod Lopes, a U.S.-based spokesman for the group, slammed their sentence as ""patently absurd"".
The court did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Jehovah's Witnesses have been under pressure for years in Russia, where the dominant Orthodox Church is championed by President Vladimir Putin. 
Orthodox scholars have cast the Jehovah's Witnesses as a dangerous foreign sect that erodes state institutions and traditional values, allegations they reject.
Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian denomination known for door-to-door preaching, close Bible study, and rejection of military service and blood transfusions. The group has about 170,000 followers in Russia, and eight million worldwide.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Britain must engage now with EU demands on guarantees of fair competition, fisheries and solvings disputes in order to seal a deal on new trade ties by a ""strict deadline"" of end-October, the EU Brexit negotiator said on Wednesday. 
Michel Barnier said London has so far not shown enough flexibility and creativity on these. But he believed a deal on new relationship to replace decades of close-knit cooperation after Brexit from 2021 was still possible, if difficult.
""On all these issues the UK side continues to disappoint,"" Barnier told a seminar. ""These are no technocratic issues. At stake are tens of thousands of European jobs and livelihoods.... our safety and wellbeing, our environment and climate, our fundamental rights.""
Britain became the first country to leave the EU last January and is now in a standstill transition period to allow both sides to agree a new deal on everything from trade to security to nuclear cooperation.
Barnier said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government was shunning the EU's demands for clarity on Britain's future state aid system and that there would not be a deal without a ""long-term, balanced and sustainable"" deal on fish.
""How can we conclude our long-term economic partnership agreement ... without knowing which system of state aid or subsidies the UK will put in place, without any assurance that the UK will not use its new regulatory autonomy to distort competition with us in the future?"" Barnier said in a speech organized by an Irish think tank.
""We are ready and we want a deal - but not at any price. We will never seal a deal to the detriment of our single market.""
Barnier said that, while there was some progress on the British side in implementing provisions of an earlier divorce agreement on the sensitive Irish border, he was ""worried and disappointed"" by insufficient overall progress.
Barnier saw his British counterpart, David Frost, in London on Sunday and told the seminar London has so far not budged ahead of a full negotiating round due next week.
The EU side now doubts a deal can be sealed in time for approval at Oct.15-16 summit of the bloc's 27 national leaders in Brussels and Barnier also said the strict deadline was the end of that month to give enough time for ratification by 2021. 

""We have no more time to lose,"" Barnier said.

Meruvia is one of 3 million students enrolled in virtual classes in the South American nation, according to UNESCO data, as schools stay closed for the year due to the coronavirus pandemic. This dependence on pricey, yet often unreliable, internet services means families living in poverty have an even bigger financial burden to maintain their children's education. 
The new era of virtual learning shines a spotlight on the deep disparity between Bolivia's rich and poor. Only about 40% of Bolivians - and only 3% in rural areas- have internet access, according to data by Bolivia's telecoms authority. 
Bolivia is considered one of the most dire countries in the region for internet access in households with children, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), which also names El Salvador, Paraguay and Peru.
""It is very different,"" said Meruvia, who attends a public school in a poor neighborhood in La Paz, the capital. ""Some teachers cannot express themselves well because they do not have good internet or some who are older do not know how to handle their cell phones."" 
Patricia Kattan, whose two daughters are enrolled in private school, had to purchase several expensive pieces of equipment to keep up with the demands of virtual learning. 
""We had to invest in an extra computer with a webcam and headphones for each because we're in an apartment and each one needs their own desk and privacy in order have good use of the classes,"" Kattan said. 
Bridging the digital divide has been a topic of debate among lawmakers since schools were ordered to remain closed. 
""Education cannot be closed down, so mechanisms must immediately be activated for virtual classes and for the government to comply with its constitutional mandate to guarantee the right to education,"" Víctor Ramírez, a senator from the MAS political party, told Reuters.

Hundreds of young men and women attended the first session at one of the stadiums in Tashkent on Wednesday morning, wearing masks. The weather was comfortably warm for those seated in the shade while other test-takers used clothes and papers to protect themselves from direct sunlight.

The government said on Wednesday that cafes, restaurants and tea houses will reopen from Sept.5 with some restrictions, as well as cinemas, theaters and theme parks.

Mosques and other places of worship will be allowed to hold collective prayers from that date. Uzbekistan will also reopen its border with neighboring Kyrgyzstan. Masks will remain mandatory in public areas and mass events will remain banned.

Built between 1893 and 1907, the Pazo de Meiras palace in the region of Galicia was acquired in 1938, during the civil war, using public donations.
Judge Marta Canales said in her ruling on Wednesday that the donations were not destined for Franco himself ""but to the head of state"".
A subsequent acquisition by Franco in 1941 when ownership was transferred to the dictator, was fake, she added.
""Franco pays nothing...Franco buys nothing,"" she said.
The claim on the estate, which was valued at more than 5 million euros ($5.93 million) by the family last year, followed the removal of Franco's remains from a massive mausoleum near Madrid and other initiatives to remove dictatorship-era symbols approved by various leftist governments since Franco's death in 1975.
The family can still appeal the ruling. One of the dictator's grandsons, Francis Franco, did not reply to a request for comment. His lawyer was not immediately available.
Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo welcomed the ruling. 
""Today democracy has taken a big step,"" she said. 
Public opinion is still divided over the 1936-1939 Spanish Civil War, which tore apart families and communities, and the legacy of the ensuing fascist dictatorship that ended with Franco’s death.
More than half a million people died during the civil war and an estimated 150,000 were killed by Franco's regime, while 450,000 were forced to leave Spain, historians estimate.

Prosecutors in Berlin, who had received hundreds of complaints accusing Esken of slander, said she was exercising her constitutional right to express her opinion. Esken's SPD party is the junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative-led ruling coalition.
In an Aug. 1 tweet, Esken said protesters at a Berlin march threatened the health of others by violating social distancing rules and ignoring requirements to wear face masks. 
""The pointed term 'Covidiot' is, as an expression of opinion in the political discourse in the coronavirus pandemic, not liable for prosecution and is covered by the constitutionally protected freedom of speech,"" prosecutors said.
Germany has seen mass protests in the past few weeks against curbs imposed by authorities to contain the spread of the new coronavirus and so limit the damage caused by COVID-19.
The marches have attracted a mixed crowd of civil rights activists and people who oppose vaccinations, as well as neo-Nazis and members of far-right groups including the opposition party Alternative for Germany (AfD).
On Saturday, Berlin police broke up a mass protest against coronavirus curbs and arrested 300 people after demonstrators failed to keep their distance and wear masks as instructed.

During the protest, a crowd stormed the steps of the Reichstag parliament building and waved far-right flags, which was condemned by SPD Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and other leading politicians.

In November 2014, three suspected members of the Sunni Muslim jihadist group opened fire on Shi’ites who were celebrating Ashura, a holy festival in their calendar, in the village of Dalwa, killing eight people there.
Seven defendants were sentenced to death after their conviction while three others were handed 25-year jail terms each, the Ekhbariya channel said on Twitter.
Sunni militants have carried out many shootings and bombings in Saudi Arabia since 2014, soon after the then-Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, summoned Saudi supporters to mount attacks at home instead of abroad in wars in Syria and Iraq.
Most of the attacks targeted minority Saudi Shi’ites or state security officers, and were carried out by people who had sworn allegiance to Islamic State or were claimed by the militant group in online postings, Saudi authorities said.
Saudi Arabia had earlier barred its citizens from going to wage jihad (holy war) abroad, used its Sunni clergy to denounce Islamic State, imposed prison terms for supporting the group and joined U.S.-led air strikes against IS in Syria.

The prime minister is pushing to get Britons back to work and school and his team had decided restrictions imposed in the Manchester area of northwest England should be eased.
But local politicians, including Greater Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, condemned the planned relaxation in the rules and warned infections were rising again.
Five hours after Burnham intervened, Johnson’s Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced the policy would be reversed.

Saudi Arabia mostly bans flights to and from Israel from using its airspace, though since 2018 it has permitted Air India to fly over the country to Tel Aviv.
The decision, which the kingdom's aviation authority said came at the request of the UAE, follows a historic agreement last month between Abu Dhabi and Israel to normalize ties. 
All flights to and from the UAE can use Saudi airspace, state news agency reported, citing the aviation authority, without mentioning Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, without citing Saudi Arabia, said Israeli planes can fly directly to the UAE, tracing the flight path on a map with his finger over the kingdom.
The decision cuts flying time between the Middle East states by several hours.
Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud said shortly after the airspace report that the kingdom's position in support of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital had not changed.
Emirati and Israeli officials will allow their citizens to visit each other's countries once they normalize ties and have said there would be direct service.
Those traveling from Israel will gain better access to hundreds of global destinations via Abu Dhabi and Dubai hubs once flights launch. 

Israel's El Al this week flew through Saudi airspace carrying U.S. and Israeli delegations from Tel Aviv to Abu Dhabi, the first official flight by an Israeli carrier over the kingdom. The return flight also used Saudi airspace.

Russian newspaper RBC said the general prosecutor's office had asked Germany's justice ministry for information on Navalny's treatment, including test results for drugs, poisons, heavy metals and cholinesterase inhibitors, which affect the nervous system.
There was no immediate comment from the prosecutor's office, or from the German justice ministry on how it would respond to the request.
Russian prosecutors said last month they saw no need for a criminal investigation into the case as they had found no sign that any crime had been committed.
Navalny, a thorn in the side of President Vladimir Putin for the past decade, was taken ill on a flight from Siberia to Moscow on Aug. 20 after drinking tea at the airport. His allies believe he was the latest of several Kremlin critics to be deliberately poisoned, but Russian authorities have said there is no evidence of this.
Navalny was flown last month to the Charite hospital in Berlin, where doctors said he may have been poisoned with a cholinesterase inhibitor, a substance found in nerve toxins such as the one used in the attempted poisoning of a former Russian double agent in England in 2018.
""Is there a conclusion of a commission of forensic medical experts with a detailed spectral analysis of any narcotic, psychotropic, potent, poisonous substances identified in the organism of A.A. Navalny, including heavy metals?"" asked the letter, which was posted in full on RBC's website.
""Were any substances found in A.A. Navalny's biological specimens from the group of cholinesterase inhibitors? Which ones, exactly?""
It posed a series of other detailed questions, including:
- What medicines were being used to treat Navalny, and in what doses
- Whether his condition had worsened, and why
- What were the results of tests on his heart and respiratory and central nervous systems.
The prosecutor's office asked for samples to be taken from Navalny's blood, urine, hair, nails, saliva and the inside of his cheek, and for copies of medical reports to be provided as soon as possible.
It promised to treat the results confidentially, and solely for the purpose of investigating what had happened to Navalny.

The letter said Russian investigators had meanwhile seized more than 100 items, examined closed-circuit television footage and ordered more than 20 forensic examinations but had so far not uncovered evidence that Navalny had been the victim of a deliberate criminal act.

Ireland dropped a 14-day quarantine requirement for arrivals from an initial list of 15 European countries in late July and cut that down to 10 on Aug. 4, when an increase in cases in the likes of Malta and Cyprus struck them off the list.
More countries were due to be added or removed every two weeks, but the list has not been amended since Ireland's 14-day cumulative cases per 100,000 of population rose above 30 from around three cases when the measure was introduced.
""If we essentially pegged the countries that qualify to our own rate, we would have something perverse happening, which is as the prevalence of COVID increased in Ireland, we would be opening ourselves up to more and more countries with high rates of COVID,"" Stephen Donnelly told the Newstalk radio station.
""If we were simply to do that, it would self-evidently lead to a higher spread of the virus in the country. That's why we have it under review at the moment.""
The government's initial plan was to judge whether to ease quarantine restrictions based on the number of new COVID-19 cases, the trend and the quality of testing and tracing in qualifying countries.
Nine European countries not on the list currently have a lower 14-day case rate than Ireland. They include Britain, Germany and Sweden, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
Irish airline Ryanair initiated legal proceedings against the government in late July, questioning the legality of travel restrictions.

CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Germ-conscious in the pandemic era but still craving a donut and coffee? Procter & Gamble, which has already teamed up with Dunkin' Brands to promote the use of its cleaning products in restaurants, is looking for more partners -- and it's hoping for a payoff in the grocery store aisle.
Procter & Gamble (N:PG) is chasing deals with fast-food, hospitality, transportation and healthcare companies to stick P&G branding for products like Dawn dish soap and Spic and Span counter scrubs prominently on walls and windows  to help lure back customers who began to shy away from places like restaurants and hotels in March as fears of the coronavirus took hold, the company told Reuters.
P&G  in July  struck agreements with several  existing restaurant partners - including Dunkin' Brands' (O:DNKN) donut shops and Denny's (O:DENN) coffee shops - to tout their use of Dawn and Spic and Span counter scrubs.
It's a ""halo effect,"" Paul Edmondson, the head of P&G Professional North America, said of the promotion's marketing advantage.  ""It's the  same consumer  that's shopping in stores that's eating out at one of the restaurants."" 
P&G, one of the top  advertising  spenders in the United States,  is racing against  Clorox (N:CLX) and Lysol maker  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) to  plug home cleaning brands at  restaurants  and  other businesses.
""The reason why P&G wants to do this is because...it can produce free publicity,"" said Kimberly Whitler, an associate professor of business at University of Virginia Darden (NYSE:DRI) School of Business and a former P&G marketing executive. ""It's a new outlet where consumers are not necessarily thinking about P&G products, and suddenly they're seeing them there.""
Promoting household products such as  Spic and Span, Dawn and Microban 24  sanitizer at  major restaurant chains  can serve as a  cheap form of marketing  for P&G, said Lisa Kane,  group director for strategy at branding firm  Siegel+Gale. 
""It gives them more control, and they can choose who they partner with and allow this co-branding with,"" Kane said. P&G's clients may tout their locations as deep-cleaned and disinfected frequently, although the promotion doesn't require an inspection or any independent verification by P&G that the locations are  actually clean.
Disinfectants kill whatever is on a surface, but not long term - these businesses would have to spray things down over and over again if people are constantly sitting on chairs or using bathrooms, regulatory consultant Kevin Kutcel said. ""Legally, 'deep-cleaning' doesn't mean anything,"" he added.
In May, Reckitt Benckiser signed  a deal with  Hilton Hotels (N:HLT),  which put up signs and labels in hotel lobbies saying its bed sheets and common spaces are cleaned using Lysol or Dettol products. Rival  Clorox Co  (N:CLX) recently  began  working in some cities with  ride-sharing company Uber (NYSE:UBER) (RIC), whose users now get a notification with each booking confirmation that their driver has Clorox wipes available - with the Clorox logo prominently displayed.
""We believe that advertising is our way to play offense, gain market share and benefit disproportionately for years to come,""  Clorox's chief executive, Benno Dorer, told Reuters in an interview. ""We can grow market share when others do the opposite.""
Clorox, which plans to spend an amount representing about 11% of sales on advertising  during this fiscal full year, said it is in talks with ""a lot more companies"" for corporate deals, but declined to name any in the works.  
""There's enough research suggesting that during a recession, market share gains are much stickier and have a much more profound long-term effect,"" Dorer  said. 
P&G says marketing its products is not the main goal of its deals, and it is not forcing any restaurants to use stickers that specifically cite P&G brands.
To lure customers who may be nervous about dining out, some restaurant chains have begun putting signs in visible locations stating that they are  participating in safety ""seal of approval"" programs run by the National Restaurant Association and other groups. 
Nearly all  advertisers  have confronted a chaotic marketing landscape on TV and social media this year, reworking ads to be sensitive to national reckonings over the health crisis as well as racism.  

P&G has spent more than $65 million to  advertise  Mr. Clean on TV so far this year, and more than $36 million on commercials for  its home cleaner  Microban, according to data from TV ad tracking firm  iSpot.

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Steve Bannon’s effort to export his fiery popularism to Europe is failing,"By Mark Hosenball
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Attempts by former White House adviser Steve Bannon to export President Donald Trump's brand of populism to Europe are on the rocks, according to several of his current and former political partners in Italy and Belgium.
After Bannon was charged with fraud for his role in an effort to raise money to help build Trump's wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, two people working with him said an effort to found an academy for right-wing Roman Catholic activists in Italy faces a criminal inquiry by the Rome criminal court and a project aimed at ending the European Union has closed up shop.
After helping guide Trump to his 2016 election victory, Bannon served for seven months as the White House chief strategist. He briefly returned to his former employer, the right-wing Breitbart News, but later stepped down.
Then he turned his sights on Europe, where he has both tried to establish what his Italian partner calls an ""academy for the Judeo-Christian West"" at an Italian monastery and to promote right-wing parties skeptical about the European Union.
Bannon and his spokeswoman did not respond to multiple requests for comments about his activities in Europe. 
As adviser to Trump, Bannon helped articulate the ""America First"" right-wing populism and fierce opposition to immigration that have been hallmarks of the president's time in office. 
He was arrested on a yacht last month and pleaded not guilty to charges of defrauding hundreds of thousands of donors to the $25 million ""We Build the Wall"" campaign. Bannon has dismissed the charges as politically motivated.
ITALIAN PROBE
One of the main post-Trump causes Bannon promoted has been the Dignitatis Humanae Institute, which supports conservative Catholic causes and is based in an 800-year old monastery south of Rome. 
Along with Bannon, the institute has been trying to set up a two-track program: an ""academy for the Judeo-Christian West"" with a Bannon-designed curriculum and the Cardinal Martino Academy, which will promote Catholic social teachings, said Benjamin Harnwell, a former British Conservative party activist who leads the institute and works with the former Trump aide.
Harnwell told Reuters he has recently had to delay his plans to further develop the institute after Italian authorities tried to evict him from the monastery. 
In October, Italy's Culture Ministry revoked the institute's permission to use the monastery, saying Harnwell's organization did not meet the requirements to manage it and had lied when applying to use the building.
The Culture Ministry press office said Harnwell's organization had not managed a cultural site for at least five years, a condition for those applying to use the building. 
In making its application, the institute said that it had operated an abbey in central Italy since 2015. However state television RAI said in a documentary that the abbey was an inaccessible ruin closed to the public. In announcing its intention to revoke the permission, the ministry also cited violations of various contractual obligations including a failure to pay concession fees and do maintenance work.
Harnwell's institute appealed to a local administrative court, which blocked the eviction order, effectively allowing the organization to keep managing the monastery. A ministry spokesman said it has now asked the State Council, Italy's top administrative court, to review the local court decision.
In a separate action, Italy's Court of Auditors said the institute did not pay rent of around 200,000 euros ($236,340) for 2018 and 2019. Harnwell did not directly address this accusation in responding to questions from Reuters but said Italian authorities were trying to undermine the institute because of politics.
In text message exchanges with Reuters, Harnwell said the institute ""never participated fraudulently in the tender as alleged,"" and argued that ""the Ministry for Culture annulled its lease out of political considerations."" 
He confirmed Italian media reports that prosecutors in Rome are also conducting an ongoing probe of the institute. Harnwell argued that the ""criminal court is proceeding with its own case to discuss precisely the same material that we've just been cleared of by the administrative court."" 
Reuters was unable to confirm any specifics of the probe. 
The prosecutor's office declined to comment in response to questions by Reuters about any probes into the group.
THE 'MOVEMENT' STOPS
Separately, a Brussels-based Bannon-backed project aimed at undermining the European Union shut up shop last year, said Mischael Modrikamen, the Belgian lawyer who teamed up with Bannon to promote the anti-EU ""The Movement.""
Bannon and his associates' principal objective was to marshal anti-EU sympathizers and parties to put forward candidates for 2019 European Parliament elections.
Populist candidates from France, Italy and Britain did well, but their counterparts in Germany, Austria, Denmark and Spain did not. And Bannon's ""Movement"" found little support from right-wing leaders.
Some key right-wing parties and leaders publicly distanced themselves from Bannon, with France's Marine LePen declaring last year he ""was playing no role in our campaign."" 
Modrikamen told Reuters in a phone interview this week that he had withdrawn from politics in June 2019 and that there was ""no Movement any more."" 
A European Commission spokesman declined to comment on the group.
Despite the European projects' problems, both Modrikamen and Harnwell expressed support to Reuters for Bannon and said they wished him well in facing the U.S. fraud charges.

""We are here for and we will continue to support Iraq,"" Macron said at a news conference in Baghdad with his Iraqi counterpart Barham Salih.
Iraq should not become a battleground for proxy conflicts between other states, Salih said.
Macron's visit is the first by a Western leader to Iraq since Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi took office in May, becoming the third head of government in a chaotic 10-week period that followed months of deadly protests in a country exhausted by decades of sanctions, war, corruption and economic challenges.
Kadhimi was selected by parliament in May to head a government that would guide the country towards early elections and has called for one to be held in June 2021. His predecessor Adel Abdul Mahdi quit under pressure from protests against corruption and foreign interference in December last year.

Early elections are a main demand of anti-government protesters who staged months of mass demonstrations last year and were killed in their hundreds by security forces and gunmen suspected of links to Iran-backed militia groups.

Jacob Ngarivhume was arrested along with journalist Hopewell Chin'ono on July 20, on charges of inciting violence. Ngarivhume had called for the protests on July 31 and Chin'ono wrote about the call.
Both men had been denied bail three times, but on Wednesday High Court judge Siyabona Musithu said the politician would be released from detention at a maximum security prison after paying 50,000 Zimbabwe dollars ($600).
The judge said a lower court had erred in denying Ngarivhume bail. Another judge will rule on whether to free Chin'ono later on Wednesday.
As part of bail conditions, Ngarivhume, who leads a small opposition party, Transform Zimbabwe, was barred from posting on Twitter until his case is finalised, must surrender his passport to the court and report to the police three times a week.
Prevented from protesting by restrictions the government says are needed to stop the spread of COVID-19, activists have used a Twitter hashtag #ZimbabweanLivesMatter to criticise President Emmerson Mnangagwa and encourage global pressure on his government. 
When Chin'ono made a routine court appearance on Tuesday, he looked visibly frail and told reporters that he was unwell and doctors had taken a sample to test for COVID-19.
The detention of Ngarivhume and Chin'ono and arrest of dozens of activists has led to accusations that the government is persecuting the opposition, a charge the authorities deny.

The opposition has disputed Mnangagwa's 2018 election, which took place after he replaced ruler Robert Mugabe in a coup, promising a break with Mugabe's authoritarian style.

""The time when you will be able to kiss her or caress her seems further away all the time,"" she said.
Spain brought the first wave of coronavirus cases largely under control through a strict lockdown ending in June.
But the country has seen a sharp rise in infections in recent weeks, meaning some restrictions have been reimposed including limiting gatherings and access to nursing homes.
Still, care homes are no longer a major source of new infections, unlike the initial surge in March when many of those who died of COVID-19 were elderly residents.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore must remain open to overseas talent even as it tightens immigration curbs to preserve local jobs, its prime minister said on Wednesday, warning a turn inwards would be a blow for the global business hub facing a record recession.
The city-state's jobless rate has hit a decade-high in recent months, despite the government spending about S$100 billion ($73.47 billion) in support measures to offset the impact of COVID-19 on its open economy. 
Worries over jobs have turned the focus on its high immigration levels, an issue emphasized by opposition parties during a July general election in which they mounted a historic challenge to the ruling party's unbroken hold on power. 
""Even as we adjust our work pass policies, we must be careful not to give the wrong impression that we are now closing up and no longer welcoming foreigners,"" Lee Hsien Loong said in a near two-hour impassioned speech in parliament.
""We may be under stress now, but we cannot afford to turn inwards.""
Lee's government, which has been tightening the inflow of foreigners for several years, is taking more steps to promote local hiring. Last week, it raised the salary threshold for issuing work passes for foreigners, the second hike this year. 
Singapore's political stability and pro-business policies have long attracted investments from big global firms.
Lee said a pharmaceutical firm, which he did not name, wanted to build a vaccine manufacturing facility in Singapore and several Fortune 500 companies were looking to relocate their regional headquarters to the city-state.
Financial firms also wanted to expand, including their technology operations. 
""But for them to come here, they must feel welcome and be allowed to bring in the talent they need,"" he added.
Last month, authorities put 47 companies on a watch-list for potential discriminatory hiring practices against locals.
Online vitriol against foreigners prompted state investor Temasek (TEM.UL) to call out ""racist"" posts against its employees.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has not had access to North Korea since the secretive communist state expelled its inspectors in 2009. Pyongyang pressed ahead with its nuclear weapons programme and soon resumed nuclear testing. Its last detonation of a nuclear weapon was in 2017.
Since its expulsion the agency has been monitoring North Korea's activities from afar, including with satellite imagery.
It is ""almost certain"" the experimental 5-megawatt reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear complex, which is widely believed to have produced plutonium for weapons, has been shut down since early December 2018, the IAEA said in an annual report https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/gc/gc64-18.pdf dated Sept. 1 and posted online. 
There has, however, been no telltale steam at the plutonium reprocessing lab there, suggesting the last batch of spent fuel stayed in the reactor building.
""It is almost certain that no reprocessing activity took place and that the plutonium produced in the 5MW(e) reactor during the most recent operational cycle has not been separated,"" the IAEA report said, adding that construction appeared to continue on a light-water reactor at Yongbyon.
By contrast, vehicle movements and the operation of cooling units at a fuel-rod fabrication plant at Yongbyon suggests North Korea has been producing enriched uranium with centrifuges there, it said.
North Korea could also be enriching uranium at a facility just outside Pyongyang known as Kangson that has only attracted attention as a potential enrichment site in recent years https://www.reuters.com/article/northkorea-usa-denuclearisation-yongbyon/explainer-nkoreas-yongbyon-nuclear-complex-takes-centre-stage-in-stalled-talks-idUSL3N20J05S. 
""The construction of this complex at Kangson took place before the construction of the reported centrifuge enrichment facility at Yongbyon, with which it shares some characteristics,"" the IAEA said.

""If the Kangson complex is a centrifuge enrichment facility this would be consistent with the Agency's assessed chronology of the development of the DPRK's reported uranium enrichment programme,"" it said, using North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Maternal deaths in Britain occur in fewer than 1 in 10,000 pregnancies, official data shows. From 2015 to 2017, 209 mothers died from pregnancy-related causes, out of more than 2.2 million women who gave birth in the United Kingdom.
While overall maternal mortality rates had fallen over the past decade, the government said, evidence pointed to a widening gap between women from different ethnic backgrounds.
It said Black British mothers were five times more likely than white mothers to die in pregnancy or within the first six weeks after childbirth.
""It’s completely unacceptable for women to experience greater risk of poor outcomes during their pregnancy, or after giving birth because of the colour of their skin,"" said minister Nadine Dorries, whose portfolio includes patient safety.
The risk of dying from pregnancy-related causes was also three times higher for mothers of mixed ethnicity than for white mothers, and twice as high for women of Asian ethnicity.
Women from all ethnic minorities were also at greater risk than their white counterparts of their pregnancies resulting in a pre-term birth, stillbirth, neonatal death or a baby born with low birth weight.
Minister for Equalities Kemi Badenoch was meeting academics, public health experts and regional health service managers on Wednesday to discuss what more could be done to reduce the disparities.
The government said it had already taken steps such as changing procedures to ensure greater continuity of care from a midwife for women from ethnic minorities during pregnancy, birth and the period after birth.
The issue of health disparities between different ethnic groups in Britain has come to the fore due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Black and Asian people in England are up to 50% more likely to die after becoming infected with the virus, according to an official study.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has restored the official titles and military rank to his royal consort, according to a palace announcement on Wednesday, nearly a year after she was accused of being disloyal and disappeared from public view.
The announcement comes as Thailand is roiled by anti-government protests during which demands have also been made for curbs to newly expanded powers of the king, breaking a strong taboo in a nation where conservative tradition upholds the monarch as semi-divine and above criticism. 
Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi, 35, last October had been stripped of the title Royal Noble (OTC:NEBLQ) Consort in a palace statement that called her ""ungrateful"" in conducting a rivalry with Queen Suthida, the monarch's wife.
However, a statement published in the government's Royal Gazette on Wednesday said Sineenat ""is untainted"" and therefore entitled to the royal noble consort title and all her previous posts within the palace.
""Therefore, the stripping of royal titles, official position in serving the crown in military capacity and military ranks and the recall of all declarations has never taken place,"" the statement said. The order is effective Aug. 28.
Sineenat disappeared after her public disgrace and her whereabouts could not be confirmed. This week, Bild newspaper reported she had arrived in Germany, where the Thai king spends much of the year.
King Vajiralongkorn was officially crowned as constitutional monarch in May last year after first taking the throne following the 2016 death of his father, who reigned for 70 years.
Days before his coronation, the king married the deputy head of his personal bodyguard, Suthida Tidjai, 42, giving her the title of Queen Suthida Bajrasudhabimalalakshana.

A little over two months later, he conferred the title Royal Noble Consort to Sineenat, a former nurse and his bodyguard. It was the first such appointment in almost a century, long before the end of absolute monarchy in 1932.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Bipartisan campaign aims to reassure U.S. voters as Trump questions election integrity,"By Tim Reid
(Reuters) - At least a dozen groups are planning a large-scale, bipartisan public relations campaign to counter any attempt by President Donald Trump to cast doubt on the integrity of the November election or dispute the result should he lose, people involved in the effort told Reuters.
One organization, the National Task Force on Election Crises, is contacting leading politicians from both major parties, military figures, star athletes, faith leaders and business executives, asking them to reassure voters about the integrity of the election result if chaos ensues after the Nov. 3 contest.
While members of the task force insist the effort will be aimed at supporters of both Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden, Trump's questioning of mail-in ballots and the fairness of the election as well as his disparaging of the U.S. Postal Service have been ""front and center"" in recent internal discussions, one member said.
Separately, a loose coalition of mostly bipartisan civic groups is in early talks about how to encourage voters to be patient while all ballots are counted and to ensure a secure transition of power if Trump loses to Biden.
The groups, which revealed their plans for the first time, said their preparations are driven in part by concerns over how Trump and his supporters will react to a potential defeat. The Republican president, who is trailing in polls, has alleged without evidence that the election is ""rigged"" and has made unfounded claims that voting by mail is riddled with fraud.
""We have the unprecedented situation of a man who took the oath of office to support the Constitution but is directly challenging the result of the election prior to the outcome,"" said Tom Ridge, a former Homeland Security Department secretary under Republican President George W. Bush and now co-chairman of VoteSafe, a group involved in the effort.
""A lot of people are nervous,"" Ridge added. ""It's disgusting, it's contemptible.""
Thea McDonald, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, accused the groups of ""peddling conspiracy theories"" to help Biden, adding: ""President Trump and his campaign are fighting for a free, fair, transparent election in which every valid ballot counts - once.”
The election crises task force, a bipartisan organization made up of 50 former cabinet members, politicians and election experts, was formed two years ago to ensure a secure election that maximizes voter confidence by providing advice to election officials and voters on a range of potential problems.
One idea under discussion is to ask former presidents Bush and Democrat Barack Obama to address U.S. voters should the validity of the election result be questioned.
A person familiar with the task force's work stressed the outreach effort to leading public figures is in its early stages and declined to give names of potential participants. 
Task force members include Michael Chertoff, another former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security under Bush, and Jim Baker, former FBI general counsel under Obama and Trump.
The task force also has meetings next month with big tech firms, including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter, to provide them advice and learn how the companies plan to deal with election disinformation on their platforms.
One person familiar with the task force's plans said: ""Trump is unconcerned with the public's confidence in the election and is actively trying to undermine it."" 
DELAY DOESN'T MEAN FRAUD, GROUPS SAY
With an unprecedented number of Americans expected to mail their ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic, there is growing consensus that it could be weeks before ballots are counted and the outcome of the White House contest is known.
A central message of the groups involved in the public relations outreach: A delayed result does not mean a fraudulent one. 
Meredith (NYSE:MDP) McGehee, executive director of Issue One, a bipartisan group whose broad mission is political reform of the American political system, said her organization is in talks with more than 10 cross-party groups. McGehee said groups will be aiming their message at both Biden and Trump supporters if the election result is contested.
However, McGehee said of Trump, ""There is only one candidate questioning the integrity of the election and calling it rigged.""
Other groups in discussions with Issue One include VoteSafe, the League of Women Voters, RepresentUs and Protect Democracy, McGehee said.
Issue One aims to involve some of its 202-member ""reformers caucus,"" a bipartisan group of former cabinet secretaries, ambassadors and members of Congress, in its messaging to voters.
Ridge, also an Issue One member, said he has been talking with members of the Republican Party about a disputed election, especially if it is Trump who contests the result. 
Another group in talks with Issue One is Take Back Our Republic, a non-partisan organization that aims to deliver conservative solutions for political reform.

Its executive director, John Pudner, said there is also concern on the right that Democrats will claim the election was stolen if Trump wins.

Scuffles broke out between protesters and police, who fired pepper spray and made several arrests. Protesters threw eggs, apples and garbage against the heavily guarded parliament. 
They also shook police vehicles, and about 20 officers were affected by an unknown substance aimed at them by protesters, Sofia Police Chief Georgi Hadzhiev said 
The rally took place on the first sitting of parliament after summer recess. Protesters called it the ""Grand National Uprising"" in response the government's plan for a new constitution.
Protesters accuse three-times premier Borissov, 61, of failing to fight the corruption that erodes the rule of law and benefits powerful tycoons in the European Union's poorest country.
In parliament, President Rumen Radev called for the resignation of Borissov's center-right government and appealed to deputies to dismiss the plans for a new constitution.
""It was not the lack of new constitution that brought the people on the streets, but the lack of morality in the leadership, the erosion of statehood and the corruption,"" he said.
Borissov has pledged to resign if parliament approves his call for the election of a grand national assembly tasked with voting on a new constitution. However, he is not likely to get enough votes to push ahead with his plan.
Protesters, as well as opposition parties, have dismissed the proposal as a ploy aimed at keeping Borissov in office longer.

Bulgaria, which joined the EU in 2007, ranks as its most corrupt member according to Transparency International, and is yet to jail a senior official on corruption charges.

Some Belarusian media workers walked out amid weeks of protests over a disputed Aug. 9 presidential election marred by vote rigging allegations that have posed the biggest challenge yet to Lukashenko's 26-year rule.
Neighboring Russia is a close ally of Minsk, and Lukashenko said that Kremlin-backed RT, formerly known as Russia Today, had played a vital role in helping Belarusian state media. 
The former state farm boss was speaking in an interview aired by RT.
""You understand how important you were to us during this difficult period. And what you demonstrated technically, your IT specialists, and journalists, and correspondents, and so on ... and your manager. This is worth a lot,"" he said. 
""I am grateful for this support,"" he said, in a video aired on Sept. 1. 
RT did not immediately reply to a request for comment as to the nature of its assistance. But its correspondent, who conducted the interview, told Lukashenko it was important to note that RT had not actually been taking people's jobs.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis held his first weekly general audience in public in six months on Wednesday, smiling and chatting with some of the crowd as they pressed forward to greet him.
The audience, at which the pope announced a day of prayer and fasting for Lebanon, was held in the San Damaso courtyard of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace.
Nearly everyone among the audience of 500 or so wore masks and sat in seats arranged to ensure social distancing.
""After so many months, we resume our encounters face to face and not screen to screen, face to face, and this is beautiful,"" he said to applause at the start of the audience.
Francis clearly enjoyed himself as he walked past guests who had pushed together behind barriers, frequently stopping to converse with them from a distance of one to two meters (yards).
The pope last held an audience with a public crowd in early March. After that, the coronavirus pandemic forced him to hold virtual audiences transmitted from the official papal library over television or the internet, an experience he described as akin to being ""caged"".
He blessed children from a distance as he passed on the way to a dais to make his address.
Francis appeared to be energized by the crowd - even though it was a far cry from the tens of thousands that can be held in St. Peter's Square, where outdoor audiences are usually held.
Francis kissed a Lebanese flag handed to him by Lebanese priest Georges Breidi and bowed his head to say a silent prayer for the country, still reeling from last month's deadly port blast and rising sectarian tensions.
At the end of the audience he invited the priest to the front to hold up the flag as the pope made an appeal for peace and dialogue in Lebanon.
He announced that Friday, Sept. 4 would be a day of prayer and fasting for Lebanon and that he was sending his Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin - the number two in the Vatican hierarchy - to Beirut on that day to represent him.
He invited members of other religions to take part.

""Lebanon cannot be abandoned to itself,"" Francis said, asking politicians, religious leaders and the international community to commit themselves with ""sincerity and transparency"" to reconstruct the country.

Taiwan has complained during the outbreak that its nationals have encountered problems entering other countries, as Taiwanese passports have the words ""Republic of China"", its formal name, written in large English font at the top, with ""Taiwan"" printed at the bottom.
The new passport, to roll out in January, enlarges the word ""Taiwan"" in English and removes the large English words ""Republic of China"", though that name in Chinese and in small English font around the national emblem will remain. 
Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said new passports were needed to prevent their nationals being mistaken for Chinese citizens, especially with the stepped up entry checks many countries have begun since the pandemic began.
""Since the beginning of the Wuhan pneumonia outbreak this year our people have kept hoping that we can give more prominence to Taiwan's visibility, avoiding people mistakenly thinking they are from China,"" Wu told reporters.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said it did not matter what ""petty moves"" Taiwan made, it could not change the fact that Taiwan was an inseparable part of China.
China claims democratic Taiwan as its sovereign territory, and says only it has the right to speak for the island internationally, a position it has pushed strongly during the pandemic, especially at the World Health Organization.
Taipei says this has confused countries and led them to impose the same restrictions on Taiwanese travellers as on Chinese, and that Taiwan has never been run by the People's Republic of China.
Taiwan has been debating its identity for years, including its name. But the pandemic has shot the issue back into the spotlight.

The government is also considering a name change - or at least a full redesign - for Taiwan's largest carrier, China Airlines (TW:2610), again to avoid confusion with China.

(Reuters) - Four people arrested for curfew violations while protesting the shooting of a Black man by a white policeman in Kenosha, Wisconsin sued the city and county governments on Tuesday, claiming they were denied free speech rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.
The plaintiffs argue that more than 150 people protesting the shooting have been taken into custody while pro-police demonstrators have been allowed to freely take to the streets, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.
""In Kenosha, there are two sets of laws - one that applies to those who protest police brutality and racism, and another for those who support the police,"" the plaintiffs argue in their complaint, which seeks a temporary restraining order until the litigation can be heard in court. 
Reuters could not reach city and county officials for comment after business hours.
Kenosha has been the scene of sometimes violent protests after video footage surfaced showing a police officer shooting Jacob Blake, 29, multiple times in the back. 
Blake was left paralyzed from the waist down and the officer, Rusten Sheskey, was placed on administrative leave during an investigation.
The protesters claim in their lawsuit that police were using the curfew to prevent them from taking part in constitutionally protected activity.
The plaintiffs also say police are selectively enforcing the curfew by not arresting pro-police demonstrators, a violation of equal protection under the law guaranteed by the constitution.

The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified monetary damages, was filed on the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump visited Kenosha over the objections of some local officials. [L1N2FY0TA]

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 05:21AM ET</span>",Death of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge executioner means little to young generation,"By Prak Chan Thul
PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - For survivors of Cambodia's brutal Khmer Rouge regime, the death of the group's executioner and security chief, known as Comrade Duch, has brought a further, small sense, of justice for their enduring suffering.
But for many younger people, awareness of an episode that destroyed Cambodia and horrified the world is fading in a country where the bulk of its 16 million people were born well after the fall of the regime more than 40 years ago.
Kaing Guek Eav, or Comrade Duch, who died on Wednesday was the first member of the Khmer Rouge leadership to face trial for his role within a regime blamed for at least 1.7 million deaths in the “killing fields” of Cambodia from 1975 to 1979.
In 2010, a U.N.-backed tribunal found him guilty of mass murder, torture and crimes against humanity at Tuol Sleng prison, a former Phnom Penh high school that still stands as a memorial to the atrocities committed inside.
""I feel relieved that I have got some justice,"" said Norng Chan Phal, 51, a survivor, when asked for his response to the death in hospital of Duch, who was 77 and had been ill in recent years.
Chan Phal lost both his parents when incarcerated as a boy with his family at Tuol Sleng, codenamed “S-21”.
Under Duch’s leadership, detainees at the jail were ordered to suppress cries of agony as guards, many of whom were teenagers, sought to extract confessions for non-existent crimes through torture.
Youk Chhang, another survivor, said he hoped young people would find lessons in the eventual punishment and death of Duch 
""His death brings some form of justice to us and perhaps the fallen can now rest in peace,"" said Youk Chhang who runs a research centre that provides documents on Khmer Rouge rule for courts.
But on the streets of the capital, some young people were frank about the fading knowledge about the period. 
Checking his smart phone on a motorbike facing the riverfront, Leang Pheng, 25, said he was aware of Duch’s death but he didn’t know he had been convicted of a crime. 
""There is modern technology, most young people play TikTok, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and watch YouTube,” said Leang Pheng, a science engineer, who also said he was unsure what Duch's death meant. 
Chamroeun, 25, another resident of the capital, said while he knew about the Khmer Rouge because of the hardships his parents faced, he felt people now didn't want to dig up the bloody past. 

""People just don’t want to think about bitter memories from the past, it's just old people who talk about their stories, ” said Chamroeun, who asked only to be identified by his first name.

NAIROBI, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The family of Paul Rusesabagina - hailed a hero in a Hollywood movie about Rwanda's 1994 genocide - has demanded that authorities in Kigali charge him in an international court after his sudden detention, his son told Reuters on Wednesday.
Rusesabagina, a former hotel manager, was played by Don Cheadle in the Oscar-nominated film 'Hotel Rwanda', which told how he used his job and his connections with the Hutu elite to protect Tutsis fleeing the slaughter.
Rwandan police said on Monday that Rusesabagina - who called for armed resistance to the now Tutsi-led government in a 2018 YouTube video - had been arrested on terrorism charges on an international warrant. His family accuses Rwanda of kidnapping him, saying they last heard from him in Dubai.
The Rwanda Investigation Bureau said he would face several charges including ""terrorism, financing terrorism ... arson, kidnap and murder"".
""If the Rwandan government think they have a solid case against him on terrorism charges or financing of terrorism, then they have to take it to an international court,"" Roger Rusesabagina, his elder son, told Reuters in an interview.
Officials in Kigali were not immediately available to comment.
The younger Rusesabagina said the Rwandan government's past attempts to charge their father internationally have flopped. 
""They tried to bring up the charges in Belgium and the charges were dismissed because they didn't make any sense. The United States did not find those charges to be believable,"" he said. 
The Belgian foreign ministry said Rwanda had informed Belgium of the arrest but declined to comment further.
Rusesabagina, a Belgian citizen who resides in Texas, U.S, was not likely to get justice in his country of birth, given the manner in which that he was moved to Kigali, the son said.
""Kidnapping should not be the solution,"" he said. 
He has been a strong critic of President Paul Kagame's government, whose credit for returning the country to stability after the genocide and boosting economic growth, has been tainted by accusations of widespread repression.
Kagame won nearly 99% of the vote in the last election. One of his main opponents, Diane Rwigara, was jailed with her mother for more than a year on charges that judges later dismissed.
Rusesabagina's family said it was now their turn to speak up for him.

""That voice of the voiceless is being shut down so he is going to need us to be his voice for a while,"" said Tresor Rusesabagina, his youngest son.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga declared on Wednesday he would run for the leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, a race he is heavily favoured to win to become the next prime minister.
Suga, a longtime aide to outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said he was entering the race to avoid a political vacuum during the pandemic. Should he win, Suga is widely expected to continue Abe's policies of fiscal and monetary stimulus.
""I thought deeply as a politician and as somebody who supported the Abe administration what I should do. As a result, I made the decision to stand as a candidate for the leadership of the LDP,"" Suga told reporters.
""In this time of national crisis, we cannot permit a political vacuum.""
Abe announced his decision to resign last week, citing poor health. The LDP's majority in the lower house of parliament will ensure the party's next leader will succeed him as prime minister.
Suga's main competitors in the Sept. 14 party vote are a former defence minister, Shigeru Ishiba, and ex-foreign minister Fumio Kishida, but Suga's position looks strong. 
He has secured the backing of five of the LDP's seven factions, public broadcaster NHK and others reported. 
The party decided on Tuesday to hold a slimmed-down election with just members of parliament and three votes from each of the 47 prefectures - an advantage for Suga.
Many party chapters will poll rank-and-file members to decide how to allocate their three votes, but experts say this is unlikely to change the momentum growing for Suga if the members of the five factions back him.
Financial markets also favour Suga, assuming he will continue with the reflationary ""Abenomics"" strategy aimed at reviving the economy.
The veteran politician has repeatedly talked about the need to quickly bring back tourism to help revitalise Japan's regional economies, which were hobbled even before the pandemic by ageing, shrinking populations.

On Wednesday, he underscored that theme again, saying he would push forward Abenomics policies and work to help struggling regions.

Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), which has governed the tiny Adriatic state for three decades and took it into NATO, won about 35% of the vote, well short of a majority and raising the possibility of a new coalition government led by an alliance of pro-Serbian parties.
In a television interview late on Tuesday, Djukanovic acknowledged that his party's poorer than-expected election result could be linked with ""people's dissatisfaction with some policies"" and low living standards. 
But he also criticised the role of Serbia and its leader Aleksandar Vucic in Montenegro, a third of whose 620,000-strong population is ethnically Serbian. 
""President Vucic and ... Serbia ... want to interfere in the internal matters of other countries and ... they want to revitalise the Greater Serbian nationalism,"" Djukanovic told Newsmax Adria TV, referring to the ideology that helped fuel the bloody wars of the 1990s that destroyed the old Yugoslavia.
Serbia's Prime Minister Ana Brnabic dismissed his charge, saying Montenegro was not ""in any way threatened by Serbia"". 
""Djukanovic ... (wants) to gain political points by false stories about Montenegro's vulnerability, instead of focusing on the needs and problems of its citizens,"" she said.
In Sunday's parliamentary election, an alliance of Serb nationalist parties named For the Future of Montenegro won 32.55% of the vote and a centrist grouping that is also opposed to Djukanovic's DPS, Peace is Our Nation, got 12.53%.
The main opposition groupings say they would continue Montenegro's bid to join the European Union if they form a coalition government.
The parties have begun deliberations on forming a new coalition government and have three months to do so.
Montenegro's pro-Serb bloc is backed by the powerful Serbian Orthodox Church, whose daily protests against a law allowing the state to seize religious assets whose historical ownership cannot be proven overshadowed the election campaign.

Opposition leaders and democracy and human rights watchdogs have long accused Djukanovic and his party of running Montenegro as their own corrupt fiefdom with links to organised crime. The DPS denies the charges.

The fresh releases are from a group of 400 ""hardcore"" Taliban prisoners, the fate of which has stalled peace negotiations between the government and insurgent group to end nearly two decades of war in Afghanistan.
This group of prisoners were released from the main jail in the capital Kabul on Monday evening and Tuesday at the same time six Afghan special forces members held by the Taliban were freed, the officials said.
""We want to finish the prisoner swap so we could start the peace process as soon as possible,"" said a senior government official, who declined to be name because of the sensitivity of the issue.
A source close to the process said the prisoner swap could be finished by today. 
The 400 are the remainder of 5,000 Taliban prisoners set for release from Afghan jails as part of a pact in February between the United States and the Taliban allowing for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. Their release was a condition for talks between the government and the insurgent group to start.
The Afghan government was reluctant to release any of the 400, which it says have been involved in some of the worst crimes including major attacks such as the 2017 truck bombing near the Germany Embassy in Kabul, until the Taliban released 24 Afghan special forces members and pilots first. 
Keeping the prisoners went against the wishes of a loya jirga that gathered in Kabul last month. The loya jirga is a traditional assembly of thousands of Afghan elders and community leaders that meets to decide political issues.
The government responded by releasing about 80 of the 400 prisoners last month. A government official said the others were kept because the Taliban dismissed calls from the loya jirga for a ceasefire.
The exchange this week occurred as Taliban violence and clashes with Afghan troops have increased in recent days.
A Taliban car bomb killed three Afghan security forces in eastern Paktia province on Tuesday, a local official said, while a defense ministry statement said 13 Taliban insurgents were killed in southern Kandahar and 11 more were killed in northern Faryab in the last 24 hours. 
Thousands of Afghan security forces and civilians have been killed since the February peace deal between the U.S. and the Taliban, according to data released by United Nations and the government.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian media outlets have dropped their opposition to a joint trial on charges they breached a gag order on reporting ex-Vatican treasurer George Pell's conviction in 2018 on child sex abuse, according to a submission discussed in court on Wednesday.
Pell's conviction was overturned by Australia's High Court in April, but the case against the media organisations and reporters remains active.
There are 30 defendants, comprising 19 journalists and 11 news outlets, in the matter before the Supreme Court of Victoria. The media had sought separate trials on the range of issues raised, but acknowledged it would be too costly for the court to run.
The state prosecutor is seeking fines and jail terms for breaches of the suppression order on the Pell verdict and aiding and abetting contempt of court by overseas media.
Lawyers in the case, first launched in April 2019, are still working out issues around how to proceed with the trial, tentatively scheduled to begin in November.
At a procedural hearing held remotely on Wednesday, most of the debate was around what information, such as emails between reporters and their editors, the state prosecutor would be allowed to seek from media outlets.
Pell was found guilty by a jury in December 2018 of sexually assaulting two choirboys, but reporting on the trial and conviction in Australia was prohibited by the County Court of Victoria so as not to prejudice another trial Pell was due to face on separate child sex abuse charges.
After the verdict, some Australian media said that an unnamed high-profile person had been convicted of a serious crime that could not be reported, while some overseas media named Pell and the charges.

The suppression order on reporting Pell's conviction was only lifted in February 2019 when the second case was dropped.

GUWAHATI, India (Reuters) - India has moved troops to its eastern stretch of border with China since clashes erupted between the nuclear-armed rivals on the western part of their border in the Himalayas in June, a government official said.
The June clash in the Ladakh region, in the western part of their border, was the worst violence between the Asian giants in decades and there has been little sign of a reduction in tension, with more military action in the past week.
The movement of troops to the eastern district of Anjaw, in Arunachal Pradesh state, which China also claims, raises the prospect of a wider face-off though both government and military officials in India ruled out any imminent confrontation.
""The military presence has surely increased, but as far as incursions are concerned, there are no verified reports as such,"" said Ayushi Sudan, Anjaw's chief civil servant, adding that several Indian army battalions were stationed there.
""There has been an increase in troop deployment since the Galwan incident, and even prior to that we'd started,"" she told Reuters by telephone, referring to the June clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.
Arunachal Pradesh, which China calls South Tibet, was at the centre of a full-scale border war between India and China in 1962, and security analysts have warned that it could become a flash-point again.
But an Indian military spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Harsh Wardhan Pande, said there was no cause for concern and the troops arriving in the area were part of regular rotation.
""Basically, it's units changing. That's happening as it happens every time, nothing much,"" Pande told Reuters from near Guwahati, the largest city in northeastern India.
""As of now, there's nothing to worry about on that front.""
But Tapir Gao, a member of parliament from Arunachal, told Reuters that Chinese troops had been regularly crossing into Indian territory.
""It's a regular phenomenon, it's nothing new,"" he said, identifying the Walong and Chaglagam areas in Anjaw as the most vulnerable.
In the 1962 war, India says its outnumbered forces ""blocked the thrust of the invading Chinese"" in Walong, and the area of mountains, meadows and fast-flowing rivers is now a government focus for settlement and road-building.
""What we're trying to do is create more possibilities and opportunities for villagers,"" said Sudan, referring to plans for clusters of villages in the disputed area.

""It's a push to resettle people.""

On Aug. 1, Guangxi University in southwestern China published a 50-point safety guide for incoming first-year female students, including a dress code that suggested that women were responsible for sexual harassment or even assault. 
""Don't wear overly revealing tops or skirts. Don't wear low-cut dresses or expose your waist or back, to avoid creating temptation,"" the guide said.
Reuters confirmed on Wednesday that spaghetti-strap tops had been banned in the university library.
The university also advised girls to avoid high heels in some circumstances.
China's nascent #MeToo movement scored a small victory this year after the country's parliament enacted legislation that for the first time defined what constitutes sexual harassment. It also holds schools and other organisations responsible for preventing and handling such harassment.
Traditional attitudes remain hostile to girls and women. In China, women who are being harassed are often seen as ""asking for it"" because they failed to dress or behave in a certain way, and many women worry they will not be taken seriously if they report harassment or held responsible for the incident. 
But such attitudes and cultural norms are increasingly being challenged. 
""It's going in the wrong direction. Shouldn't a school educate male students to respect women, no matter what she wears or if she is alone? Instead of asking the victims to review themselves,"" wrote one internet user in comments about the Guangxi University guide. 
The hashtag ""Guangxi University female students' security guide"" has garnered 200 million views on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), China's Twitter-like social media platform. 
""The safety handbook appears to be protection for girls, but in fact, it's worsening the gender stereotype that assumes women are harassed because of the way they dress,"" another user said.
The university did not respond to calls from Reuters seeking comment.
Last year, a university in Jilin province caused an uproar last year after banning female students from wearing miniskirts and camisoles.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has been rated highly by voters, according to a poll published on Wednesday, on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and greater representation of the ethnic Malay majority in his administration.
Muhyiddin received a 69% approval rating in a survey run by independent pollster Merdeka Center, six months after taking office in March following a power struggle that saw the collapse of the previous multi-ethnic government led by Mahathir Mohamad.
Survey respondents also gave a 93% approval rating for the government's handling of COVID-19 and rated it highly for helping the needy and managing the economy during the coronavirus-induced crisis. Malaysia has reported just over 9,300 coronavirus infections. 
In the last popularity poll https://reut.rs/3hSwxEP published by Merdeka Center in April last year, less than half of Malaysians approved of then-premier Mahathir as concerns over rising costs and racial issues plagued his administration.
Merdeka Center Executive Director Ibrahim Suffian said Malay voters indicated a strong preference for the administration's management of the pandemic and the ensuing economic fallout and for bringing together long-feuding Malay political parties.
""The results also indicate a significant swing of support of Malay voters towards a unified Malay political coalition,"" Ibrahim said in a statement.
Ethnic Malays account for some 60% of Malaysia's population of about 32 million, with the rest comprised mostly of ethnic Chinese and ethnic Indian minorities.
Muhyiddin, who leads the Malay-based Bersatu party, secured the premiership backed by two of the largest parties representing Malay interests - the scandal-tainted former ruling party, United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party.

But he holds a razor-thin majority in parliament. In July, UMNO, which forms the largest bloc in Muhyiddin's administration, withdrew from the prime minister's political alliance, though the party said it would continue to support the government in parliament.

1457,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 12:09AM ET</span>",One of the World’s Richest Petrostates is Running Out of Cash,"(Bloomberg) -- When Kuwait’s then-Finance Minister Anas Al-Saleh warned in 2016 that it was time to cut spending and prepare for life after oil, he was ridiculed by a population raised on a seemingly endless flow of petrodollars. Four years on, one of the world’s richest countries is struggling to make ends meet as a sharp decline in energy prices raises profound questions over how Gulf Arab states are run.
Al-Saleh’s long gone, shifting to other cabinet positions. A successor, Mariam Al-Aqeel, moved on in January, two weeks after suggesting Kuwait restructure a public-sector wage bill that’s the single biggest drag on state finances. Her replacement, Barak Al-Sheetan, warned last month there wasn’t enough to cash to pay state salaries beyond October.
Slow to adjust big-spending habits as oil revenues fall, the Gulf states are hurtling toward a moment of economic reckoning, prompting renewed debate over the future of nations that for decades bought popular loyalty with state largesse.
“We’re going to wake up one day and realize we went through all our savings, not because we didn’t check our bank statement but because we looked at it and said, it’s probably a bank glitch, and then bought the latest Rolex,” said Fawaz Al-Sirri, who heads Bensirri political and financial communications firm.
The OPEC club of oil-exporters has revived crude from its historic drop this year, but $40 is still too low. The coronavirus pandemic and shift toward renewable energy threaten to keep prices depressed.
Saudi Arabia is curbing benefits and imposing taxes. Bahrain and Oman, where reserves are less plentiful, are borrowing and seeking support from wealthier neighbors. The UAE diversified with the rise of Dubai as a logistics and finance hub.
In Kuwait, however, a standoff between the elected parliament and a government whose prime minister is appointed by the emir has led to policy gridlock. Lawmakers have thwarted plans to reallocate state handouts and blocked proposals to issue debt.
Instead, the government has almost exhausted its liquid assets, leaving it unable to cover a budget deficit expected to reach the equivalent of almost $46 billion this year.
It’s been a gradual decline for Kuwait, which in the 1970s was among the most dynamic Gulf states, with its outspoken parliament, entrepreneurial heritage and educated people.
Then the 1982 crash of an informal stock market shook Kuwait’s economy and coincided with instability from the near decade-long Iran-Iraq war. Kuwait embarked on a spending spree to rebuild after Saddam Hussein’s assault led to the 1991 Gulf War. It took years for oil to flow freely again.
Kuwait still relies on hydrocarbons for 90% of its income. The state employs 80% of working Kuwaitis, who out-earn private-sector counterparts. Benefits for housing, fuel and food can total $2,000 a month for an average family. Salaries and subsidies soak up three-quarters of spending by the state, which is heading for its seventh consecutive deficit since the 2014 oil slump.
Savings for Life
But Kuwait has money, plenty of it, stashed away in an unbreakable fund -- the world’s fourth-largest at an estimated $550 billion. Touching the Future Generations Fund, designed to ensure prosperity after oil runs out, is a controversial proposition.
Some Kuwaitis say the time has arrived. Opponents warn that without diversifying the economy and creating jobs, the savings would run out in 15-20 years.
“It’s not a solvency problem, although it’s considered a cash drought,” said Jassim Al-Saadoun, head of Kuwait-based Al-Shall Economic Consultants.
Rich for Infinity
The wealth fund has already come to the rescue, purchasing over $7 billion of assets from the Treasury in recent weeks. Parliament approved plans to halt, in years of deficit, an annual transfer of 10% of oil revenues to the fund, freeing up another $12 billion, but not enough to cover the budget shortfall.
To do that, the government has to borrow. But after a debut Eurobond issuance in 2017, Kuwait’s public-debt law lapsed. Al-Sheetan’s warnings about wages came as he tried, unsuccessfully, to convince lawmakers to support plans to borrow up to $65 billion.
His request coincided with a series of corruption scandals, some involving senior members of the ruling family, and lawmakers demanded the government end graft before accumulating debt.
Al-Sheetan is the fourth finance minister in as many years. Kuwait’s had 16 governments and seven elections since 2006.
The deadlock has undermined investor confidence. In March, S&P Global Ratings put Kuwait’s sovereign rating on negative watch. Moody’s Investors Service followed. The IMF said that month Kuwait’s “window of opportunity to tackle its challenges from the position of strength is narrowing.”
“The belief system in Kuwait is that we’re rich for infinity,” said Al-Sirri. “No one has the political capital to tell the Kuwaiti people that the party will be over soon if we don’t support change.”

1458,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 11:06PM ET</span>",Everyone could be a carrier: Covering the pandemic in rural India,"By Danish Siddiqui
BHAGALPUR, India (Reuters) - ""Every person you meet is a potential carrier of the disease,"" a doctor said to me when I visited the town of Bhagalpur and its nearby villages to cover the raging coronavirus pandemic in India's countryside.
Dr. Kumar Gaurav, a psychiatrist who conveyed that warning, was put in charge of the main hospital in Bhagalpur after the epidemic struck down some of his colleagues and others refused the job.
Infections in India now total over 3.5 million, rising from two million in just over three weeks - the third highest number of coronavirus infections in the world. The disease is rampant in rural India, where people often have to rely on the most basic health facilities.
We wanted to show the human toll of the disease in the countryside, home to two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people. So, I headed out to one of the country's most poverty-stricken regions – Bihar state in eastern India.
The area I went to was not easy to reach. Wary of the risk of infection from using public transport, I and a driver travelled for four days by car across India’s northern plains from New Delhi, through floods and along rutted roads. 
We carried full personal protection suits, masks, goggles and sanitisers – which was far more than hospital staff I encountered had.
In Bhagalpur, I found patients and their families desperate for help and medical staff struggling with a shortage of manpower and equipment that left them at risk of infection. Often, even the equipment they did have did not work. 
Gaurav's hospital was dedicated to treating patients with COVID-19, serving a population of about 10 million people, and it still received other patients. 
Most COVID-19 patients came in with relatives, who accompanied them to the intensive care wards. After trying to care of the sick – sitting with them, massaging and feeding them, these relatives would go home for the night.
Gaurav said the healthcare system was close to breaking point. One of the points of constant strain, he said, was trying to limit the visits from relatives to patients in the ICU given the risk that they could spread the infection. 
That underlined his warning to me that everyone I meet could be carrying the disease - it wasn’t a casual comment. 
The town was under a strict lockdown, but most of the residents were not wearing masks or following any social distancing rules. Traffic was frenetic. 
After four days in Bihar, we were on the road back to New Delhi.
Gaurav remained behind, the last doctor standing in his hospital on the banks of the Ganges River.
When we saw him, he was making the rounds with armed guards to try to enforce rules in the hospital. He told me he felt compelled to step up to take charge.
""A lot of my colleagues refused,"" he said. ""I had to take up the responsibility.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The large Solomon Islands province of Malaita said it will conduct an independence referendum after rejecting the Pacific nation's decision last year to cut its association with Taiwan and establish formal ties with China.
Home to about one-quarter of the Solomons' population, the U.S.-aligned Malaita has long held ambitions of becoming its own nation, although it is unlikely an independence vote would be recognised by the central government in Honiara, setting up further discord.
Malaita Premier Daniel Suidani said in a statement distributed overnight on Tuesday that Honiara had asserted continued pressure on the province to accept China despite knowing Malaita did not recognise the change in diplomatic ties. 
""It is time for Malaita people to see whether they are still willing to be part of a country that its leadership is becoming dictatorial,"" said Suidani.
""Self-determination is a core of human rights. No power can indefinitely prevent any group from eventually realizing its aspirations, regardless of how difficult it might be and how long it takes.""
The office of Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare did not immediately answer questions on Wednesday.
The Solomon Islands, located north of Australia's east coast, is a strategically important Pacific nation that switched diplomatic ties from Taiwan to Beijing last year amid a broader tussle between China and the United States for regional allies. 
Malaita has since discussed plans with the United States and its allies to develop a deep-sea port, while Chinese interests are pursuing development plans on Solomons' principal island of Guadalcanal, where the capital is located.
Tension between the most populous province and the capital escalated recently when a shipment of medical aid from Taiwan en route to Malaita was seized in Honiara, the Malaita provincial government and Taiwan's Foreign Ministry told Reuters.
There has also been fierce debate over the government's backing of charter flights from China to Solomons to repatriate stranded citizens and bring in Chinese development partners during the coronavirus pandemic.
Sogavare said in a statement earlier this week that all passengers would undergo strict testing and quarantine protocols.

(Reuters) - The Trump administration will send most of its newly purchased 150 million rapid COVID-19 tests to U.S. states for schools and critical services, a White House official said on Tuesday, as New York City pushed back reopening classrooms in a deal with union leaders.
The moves came as The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday issued a sweeping order temporarily halting landlords across the nation from evicting millions of tenants in what it said was an effort to reduce the spread of coronavirus.
The order covers all 43 million U.S. residential renters as long as they meet income eligibility requirements, although an administration official said the government does not expect an ""overwhelming"" use of the program.
The daily number of infections has been in decline across most of the United States in recent weeks, with 36,263 reported on Monday, less than half of the mid-July peak, according to a Reuters tally.
Exceptions include Midwest states such as South Dakota, where hundreds of thousands of motorcycle riders gathered for a rally in August, and Iowa.
A total of more than 183,000 people have died so far from complications of COVID-19, including 32,647 in New York and nearly 16,000 in New Jersey, the U.S. states with the highest death tolls.
In announcing that the ""overwhelming majority"" of 150 rapid antigen tests purchased from Abbot Laboratories (N:ABT) would be sent to state governors, U.S. Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary Admiral Brett Giror said top priorities included day care centers and first responders. 
The portable tests can deliver results within 15 minutes and will sell for $5. They require no additional equipment, and can use a less invasive nasal swab than traditional lab tests. 
President Donald Trump has pushed for schools across the country to reopen classrooms, but many districts have ordered students to stay home and learn online.
Among them are Los Angeles and San Diego Counties, the second and third-largest school districts in the nation respectively. 
In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said an agreement had been reached with reluctant teachers union leaders to reopen school buildings to students on September 21 as part of his plan for a mix of in-class and remote learning. 
""What we’ve agreed to is to make sure that the health measures are in place, to make sure there is time for the appropriate preparation for our educators,"" de Blasio said at a news briefing. 
Earlier this week New Jersey and California eased some restrictions imposed in the face of the pandemic, allowing restaurants to begin limited indoor dining. 
New York City's mayor has ruled out allowing restaurants to serve diners indoors anytime soon.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Masses of North Korean troops and vehicles have been practicing for a major military parade despite the country's ongoing coronavirus restrictions, satellite imagery released by a U.S. think-tank shows.
Commercial satellite imagery analysed by 38 North, a think-tank that specialises in North Korea, showed formations of troops and vehicles at the Mirim Parade Training Ground, in the suburbs of the capital city of Pyongyang on Monday.
""North Korea has been widely expected to hold a major military parade on October 10 this year to mark the 75th anniversary of the Workers’ Party of Korea,"" the 38 North report said. ""These images provide the first evidence that rehearsals are underway.""
The Mirim facility is regularly used by troops practicing the demanding marching style featured in North Korea's military parades, which usually take place in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square in front of dignitaries, often including leader Kim Jong Un.
October 10 is widely expected to be a major holiday for the North, but parade preparations appear to have been delayed compared to previous years, possibly due to anti-pandemic measures or recent severe weather, 38 North said.
In recent months, North Korea appears to have constructed around 100 permanent garages at the Mirim facility, making it nearly impossible to observe what vehicles might be involved, the report said.
""That said, numerous tire tracks in the newly concreted area servicing the garages indicate heavy activity has taken place in and around the garages,"" 38 North added.
North Korea has used such parades to showcases its growing arsenal of ballistic missiles, but since a round of international diplomacy began in 2018, such missiles have not been featured.

North Korea has said it has no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, but has imposed strict border closures and long quarantines to prevent the possible spread of the disease.

PricewaterhouseCoopers, judicial managers of Hin Leong (Pte) Ltd., has urged the family to repay creditors with 95% of their assets, estimated to be worth at least S$2 billion ($1.5 billion), according to people familiar with the matter. The family could keep the remaining 5%, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is confidential. The Lim family hasn’t agreed to the proposal, stymying talks, the people said.
The impasse signals that the banks, which also include Singapore’s DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) Holdings Ltd., may face a long battle to recover any money from the insolvent firm. Executives at Hin Leong allegedly hid some $800 million in losses for years and sold millions of barrels of oil that were collateral for bank loans, according to court documents. Lim Oon Kuin, the patriarch who founded Hin Leong, has been charged with abetment of forgery for the purpose of cheating, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
Representatives for PwC and the Lim family didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
PricewaterhouseCoopers has sued Lim and his two children to recover the $3.5 billion, including $90 million in dividends the Lims allegedly paid themselves despite the firm’s insolvency, according to a court filing. The suit for the first time drew his children Evan Lim and Lim Huey Ching into allegations of fraud, saying that they too were “personally responsible” for the liabilities. Hin Leong has been insolvent since 2012, PwC claims in the court filing. The Straits Times reported on the lawsuit Monday.
The bulk of the Lims’ other business assets include Xihe Holdings Pte. and Universal Terminal Pte. Xihe owns a fleet of vessels. The family has a 41% stake in Universal Terminal, a major petroleum storage hub in Singapore, with the balance held by PetroChina Co. Ltd. and Macquarie Asia Infrastructure Fund, according to a court document dated April 17.
The Lim family also owns a few heritage properties in Singapore known locally as “Good Class Bungalows,” mansions painted in black and white that were typical during the colonial era. The creditors had suggested the family put these houses and other personal assets into the common pool to help raise money for debt repayment, one of the people said.
HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, has the most exposure to Hin Leong at about $600 million. DBS and ABN are on the hook for more than $250 million, based on April court filings.
Hin Leong’s judicial managers are represented by Drew & Napier LLC for the lawsuit against the Lims, according to the court filing. Davinder Singh Chambers LLC acts for the Lim family.

ISTANBUL/CARACAS (Reuters) - Two high-profile Venezuelan opposition leaders are in talks with the government of President Nicolas Maduro to participate in the upcoming legislative elections despite a planned boycott, a Turkish official involved in the talks said on Tuesday.
Opposition parties had agreed to sit out the parliamentary vote slated for December, arguing the poll was tainted by Supreme Court meddling in political parties and an arbitrary expansion of the number of legislators.
But two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles and legislator Stalin Gonzalez have been quietly leading an effort to field opposition candidates despite worries that the vote will be tilted in favor of the ruling Socialist Party, according to two opposition sources. 
Capriles and Gonzalez's respective parties, Justice First and A New Era, were among the 27 parties that had pledged to boycott. 
The news signals a major rift within the opposition, which last year coalesced around the figure of congress chief Juan Guaido, who has been recognized by dozens of countries as Venezuela's legitimate president.
Mevlut Cavusoglu, the foreign minister of Turkey - a close political and commercial ally of Venezuela - said in a press conference that Capriles and Gonzalez had insisted on the presence of outside observers in the vote, which Maduro had agreed to. 
""We see that the administration and the opposition are close to a deal, and we are happy about this,"" Cavusoglu said. ""The attendance of outside observers is one of the conditions, and these conditions have been accepted by the Maduro administration.""
Neither Capriles nor Gonzalez responded to requests for comment. 
Venezuela's Information Ministry, which fields questions on behalf of Maduro's government, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Guaido's office said in a statement that it disavowed the talks with Maduro, which it said Capriles and Gonzalez undertook in their personal capacity.
""We want to be categorical: these actions were taken without the knowledge or authorization of the interim government, the National Assembly, our international allies, or the joint agreement reached and announced by 27 political organizations that comprise the democratic forces,"" the statement read. 
Cavusoglu, in a nod to the boycott, said not all of the opposition was on board.
""Some individuals supported from outside will not take part in the election no matter what,"" he said, in apparent reference to the United States' backing of Guaido.
Maduro's critics note that directors of the nation's electoral council were named by the pro-government Supreme Court rather than the opposition-controlled legislature, as mandated by the constitution. 
The new elections board also approved a two-thirds increase in the number of parliamentary seats, which Maduro's adversaries called a maneuver to dilute opposition influence and pack congress with Socialist Party supporters.

The U.S. Justice Department last month announced the seizure of 1.116 million barrels of fuel it said was destined for Venezuela. The oil industries of Venezuela and Iran, both OPEC nations, are under U.S. sanctions, and Iran earlier this year irked Washington by sending gasoline cargoes to Venezuela. 
In the Tuesday filing with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, United Arab Emirates-based Mobin International Limited said it was the owner of the cargo aboard the Bella and Bering tankers, UK-registered Oman Fuel said it owned the cargo aboard the Pandi and Luna tankers, and Oman-registered Sohar Fuel said it part-owned the cargo aboard the Luna. 
The companies said they had sold the cargoes onwards to United Arab Emirates-based Citi Energy FZC, but payment was due upon delivery, which was disrupted by the seizure. 
""Therefore, Claimants Mobin, Oman Fuel, and Sohar Fuel retain a financial stake in those agreements and have immediate right to title, possession, and control of the Defendant Properties,"" the companies wrote.
Citi Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent after normal business hours. 
The companies also disputed the assertion that the shipments were bound for Venezuela.

Lukashenko faces the biggest challenge of his 26-year rule since claiming victory in an election last month that opponents say was rigged. Lukashenko denies electoral fraud and shows no sign of backing down despite the threat of Western sanctions.
The United States is considering sanctions on seven individuals it says were involved in falsifying the election and in violence against protesters, a senior U.S. State Department official told Reuters. 
""It is a minimal effort to ... not just name and shame but to show that when people both steal elections and commit violence against peaceful protesters exercising fundamental freedoms of assembly and speech that there needs to be some accountability,"" the official said.
In a rare public reproach, Lukashenko's main challenger, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, issued a statement criticising the strategy of another opposition group with which she formed an alliance during the election campaign.
Tsikhanouskaya fled into exile two days after the Aug. 9 election. From her new base in Lithuania, she declared herself the rightful winner and launched an opposition council with the stated aim of ensuring a peaceful transfer of power. 
Tsikhanouskaya said the council ""should not be dominated by any political party"", after opposition leader Maria Kolesnikova and the team of jailed presidential candidate Viktor Babariko announced the creation of a party called 'Together'. 
The declared aim of Babariko and Kolesnikova's camp to enact constitutional reform was a distraction from the goal of removing Lukashenko and holding new elections, Tsikhanouskaya said. 
Kolesnikova's camp later said it did not wish to disrupt the council's work, and that it backed Tsikhanouskaya's call for new elections and her electoral programme. 
""Not a single Belarusian doubts Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya's victory, and that her victory was stolen,"" it said. 
'EVENTFUL SUMMER IS OVER'
Many state-run schools were used as polling stations and teachers helped count ballots in the election, which the election commission said Lukashenko won with an 80% vote share.
Answering a call from Tsikhanouskaya, students waving opposition flags staged marches and collected signatures outside several colleges in Minsk calling for Lukashenko to step down.
Video footage showed students, some wearing rucksacks, being dragged away from a crowd and detained by masked security forces. Police also detained seven journalists covering the protests for what the government said were document checks.
There were also new protests at two of the large industrial plants that underpin Lukashenko's Soviet-style economic model, the Minsk Wheel Tractor Plant and the Minsk Tractor Works, local media reported. Workers at the Belarus Hi-Tech Park on the outskirts of the capital also protested.
Thousands of people were detained after the election and United Nations human rights investigators said on Tuesday they had received reports of hundreds of cases of torture, beatings and mistreatment.
The government has denied abusing detainees. 
Lukashenko sought to draw a line under the protests as he visited a vocational training college.
""The president emphasized that the eventful summer is over,"" the official Belta news agency said. 
Lukashenko has described the protesters as ""rats"" backed from abroad. On Monday, a third member of the opposition council was detained. 
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia has imposed travel bans on Lukashenko and 29 other officials. The European Union has been working on a list of individuals to target with sanctions but is expected to exclude Lukashenko. 
Belarus is Russia's closest ally among former Soviet states, and its territory is integral to Moscow's European defence strategy. 

Russia has signalled its willingness to prop up Lukashenko's government and the two countries are discussing the refinancing of Belarusian debt, Interfax news agency reported.

1470,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 06:10PM ET</span>",Charlie Hebdo attack accomplices face trial five years on,"PARIS (Reuters) - The Islamist gunmen who struck the Charlie Hebdo magazine and a Jewish store, killing 17, are dead but on Wednesday, five years after the attack that marked the onset of a wave of Islamist violence in France, their alleged accomplices face trial.
Fourteen defendants, three of whom will be tried in absentia and may be dead, face charges including financing terrorism, membership in a terrorist organisation and supplying weapons to the perpetrators: Said and Cherif Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly. 
On Jan. 7, 2015, the Kouachi brothers went on a killing spree in the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, whose satire on race, religion and politics tested the limits of what society would accept in the name of free speech. 
They killed 12 in an attack claimed by al Qaeda.
The following day, Coulibaly, an acquaintance of Cherif Kouachi, killed a female police officer. On Jan. 9, he killed four Jewish men at a kosher supermarket. In a video, he said he acted in the name of Islamic State.
More than 250 people have been killed in France in Islamist violence since the attacks and countering the threat remains a government priority, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin says.
Al Qaeda's Yemen branch placed Charlie Hebdo's then-director on its ""wanted list"" after the weekly published caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad, including one of him in a bomb-shaped turban.
The magazine plans to re-publish the cartoons to coincide with the trial. 
""We will never lie down. We will never give up,"" editor Laurent ""Riss"" Sourisseau wrote.
President Emmanuel Macron said it was not for him to pass comment on the magazine's editorial judgement and that the freedom to blaspheme went in hand in hand with the freedom of belief in France. 
""Satire is not a discourse of hate,"" the president told a news conference in Beirut.
Among those charged are Hayat Boumedienne, Coulibaly's partner at the time of the attacks, and brothers Mohamed and Mehdi Belhoucine. All three travelled to areas of Syria under Islamic State's control days before the attacks and may be dead.
The trial, which will run for 10 weeks and be filmed throughout, is likely to evoke painful memories.
Chloe Verlhac lost her husband, cartoonist Bernard Verlhac, known as ""Tignous"", in the attack. 
""He literally died with his felt-tip in his hand,"" she told RTL radio. ""He never let go.""

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 06:10PM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. considers sanctions on Belarusians for election fraud, violence against protesters","By Arshad Mohammed and Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is considering imposing sanctions on seven Belarusians it believes were involved in falsifying the results of the Aug. 9 election and in violence against peaceful protesters, a senior State Department official said on Tuesday.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United States could consider imposing sanctions on Russia if it were to intervene overtly with force in Belarus, where protests erupted after an Aug. 9 election that the opposition says was rigged to prolong President Alexander Lukashenko's 26-year rule.
The official provided the most detailed description to date of U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun's talks in Moscow last week, in which he warned senior Russian officials against the overt use of force in Belarus, which is sandwiched between Russia and the NATO Western security alliance.
Russian President Vladimir Putin last week said he had set up a reserve police force to support Lukashenko if necessary, but he saw no need to deploy them for now.
A former Soviet republic, Belarus maintains close political, economic and cultural ties to Russia and belongs to a Russia-led military alliance. The two are also joined by a treaty that, at least on paper, proclaims a ""union state,"" which Putin has sought to develop into more of a political and economic reality.
Lukashenko denies electoral fraud and has shown no sign of backing down despite the threat of Western sanctions. The U.S. official did not name the seven Belarusians it may target, and he noted that Lukashenko already is under U.S. sanctions. 
""We've got a group of seven people that we are working with Treasury for the evidentiary package"" to impose sanctions, the official told Reuters, saying that the United States was likely to discuss the punitive measures publicly in the coming days. 
""It is a minimal effort to ... not just name and shame but to show that when people both steal elections and commit violence against peaceful protesters exercising fundamental freedoms of assembly and speech that there needs to be some accountability,"" added the official.
A person who answered the telephone at the Belarusian embassy in Washington said any questions should be asked directly to the government in Minsk.
The U.S. official said Biegun made clear last week in talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and others ""that there would be consequences in the U.S.-Russian relationship were the Russians to intervene overtly with force in Belarus.""
Biegun said this would be the case whoever wins the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election because ""the bipartisan sentiment in Congress will set the guardrails and the possibilities for the U.S.-Russian relationship,"" the official said.
The deputy secretary of state ""didn't go into the specifics. It was just, 'If you thought the last four years were bad, the next four will be worse,'"" said the U.S. official.
While U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to improve relations with his Russian counterpart, the Trump administration also has tightened U.S. sanctions on Russia and rotated U.S. troops into NATO ally Poland, moves Moscow dislikes.
There is also deep unease in the U.S. Congress over the view of American intelligence agencies that Russia worked to influence the 2016 U.S. election in favor of Trump and is doing so again ahead of the Nov. 3 election pitting the Republican president against Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden.
While the U.S. official did not name the seven Belarusians Washington may sanction, he did say that five of them were sanctioned by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on Monday. 
The three Baltic countries imposed travel bans on Lukashenko and 29 other Belarusian officials, signaling impatience with the West’s cautious approach by announcing sanctions without waiting for the rest of the European Union.
The U.S. official said the seven people the United States may sanction would be targeted under an executive order signed by then-U.S. President George W. Bush.
Executive Order 13405, signed in 2006, targets those who ""undermine democratic processes or institutions in Belarus"" or who perpetrated or were responsible for ""human rights abuses related to political repression."" Among other things, it freezes any assets those designated may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

The EU, the U.S. official said, was unlikely to impose its own sanctions until late September or early October given the time taken by its process, which typically involves coordination among its 27 members.

1472,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Xi Doubles Down on Domestic Focus as Relations with U.S. Fray,"(Bloomberg) --
China’s top leaders next month will lay out their economic strategy for the next five years that will include a new ambition to ramp up domestic consumption and make more critical technology at home in a bid to insulate the world’s second-largest economy from swirling geopolitical tensions.
Described as a strategy of ‘dual circulation’ in recent speeches by President Xi Jinping, the plan is for a more self-reliant domestic economy to serve as China’s main growth driver, supplemented by foreign technologies and investment. While details are scant so far and much of the policy ambition is already in shape in one form or another, the speeches indicate the importance of this new policy.
President Donald Trump’s aggressive efforts to curb the spread of Chinese companies and limit their access to U.S. technology is accelerating this shift inwards. It’s a policy change that may have knock on implications for the flow of goods and services around the world if it drives a concerted effort to replace imports, potentially deepening the schism with the U.S.
“The ‘dual circulation’ idea came partly as a reaction to the relentless effort from the U.S. to try to engineer a decoupling of China from the world economy, and partly as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Shang-Jin Wei, a China expert at Columbia Business School in New York and formerly chief economist of the Asian Development Bank.
There’s been some glimpses of what the policy might mean. In July, Xi called for stronger national car brands and developing key technologies domestically, but also urged foreign executives to stay in China and invest more. In a speech last week, he said China needed stronger innovation and “breakthroughs in key and core technologies as soon as possible.”
Learn from Xi
On Tuesday, the People’s Daily published a commentary about the importance of learning from that speech, emphasizing its importance as part of the leadership’s plans for China’s development.
Slogans coined by the top leadership are often theoretical and vague in the beginning, but become concrete policy over time. “Supply-side reform” was first mentioned in November 2015 with little explanation, but was later manifested in reforms such as financial deleveraging and sweeping cuts to excess capacity in steel and coal.
Read more: Xi Speeds Up China’s Inward Economic Pivot in More Hostile World
The meeting to consider the draft plan comes after a tough five years for the Chinese economy, beset by the after effects of a burst stock bubble and currency devaluation, the trade war and the Covid-19 pandemic, which pushed it into an unprecedented contraction. Now, the leadership in Beijing must try to plot a growth course which limits the U.S. ability to further hurt China but doesn’t alienate other nations.
“Xi is not actually suggesting that China retreat from the world stage,” Gilliam Collinsworth Hamilton, a China analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, wrote in a report. “Rather, the ‘dual circulation’ slogan is an attempt to have it both ways: for China to gain more control over its long-term growth without losing its role as a central hub in the global economy.”
Pushing consumers to drive more growth has been a core policy for over a decade now and had been showing some success, with consumption comprising an average 64% of gross domestic product in 2016-2019, up from 54% in the previous five years.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
China’s domestic economy has the scale for domestic circulation to support growth and there is substantial room to enhance it. At the same time a riskier and more fragmented global system will inevitably trigger efforts to ensure security of access to essential inputs, particularly in high-tech sectors. However, China is not seeking to retreat from the global economy.
Chang Shu, chief Asia economist
However, the fallout from the pandemic and the resulting contraction highlighted weakness in consumption, with retail sales shrinking for the first seven months of the year as people buy less due to lockdowns and lost income or jobs. That’s meant the main drivers for growth in 2020 have once again become government stimulus spending, investment and exports.
Previous Blowback
It’s unclear how other nations will feel about this new plan once the details are clearer. In his August speech, Xi stressed the policy shift is not about “isolated domestic circulation,” but is instead an open structure that will involve greater connection with the global system.
However, the previous ‘Made in China 2025’ industrial policy sparked alarm in Japan, Germany, the U.S. and elsewhere, where it sounded like a plan for China to undercut and replace other nations’ industries. That plan disappeared from official discourse once it became a target in the trade tensions with the U.S., but the underlying goal of develop home-grown technology to ensure Chinese self-reliance remains.
By neatly wrapping a number of existing policy goals, ‘dual circulation’ casts them in a framework that melds domestic dynamism with greater resiliency against external shocks, according to Eswar Prasad, who once led the International Monetary Fund’s China team and is now at Cornell University.
“It ties in to nationalistic aspirations of becoming less reliant on external sources for demand, technology, and financing,” Prasad said.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 05:41PM ET</span>","After UAE-Israel breakthrough, Kushner pushes other Arabs to go next","By Lisa Barrington and Dan Williams (NYSE:WMB)
AL-DHAFRA AIR BASE, Abu Dhabi (Reuters) - After accompanying an Israeli delegation to the UAE for historic normalisation talks, White House adviser Jared Kushner set off on a tour of other Gulf capitals on Tuesday, looking for more Arab support.
Israel and the United Arab Emirates set up a joint committee to cooperate on financial services at the talks in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi. Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law, accompanied the Israeli delegation on Monday on what was billed as the first Israeli commercial flight to the influential Gulf monarchy, which agreed in August to normalise relations.
Israel exchanged embassies with neighbours Egypt and Jordan under peace deals decades ago. But until now, all other Arab states had demanded it first cede more land to the Palestinians.
In remarks reported by the UAE state news agency WAM, Kushner suggested other Arab states could follow quickly. Asked when the next would normalise ties with Israel, he was quoted as saying: “Let’s hope it’s months.”
Kushner later flew to Bahrain and then Saudi Arabia and is expected also to visit Qatar.
While no other Arab country has yet indicated a willingness to follow the UAE, the richest, Saudi Arabia, allowed the El Al charter flight carrying Kushner and the Israelis to use its air space.
In Bahrain, which houses the U.S. naval headquarters for the region, the state news agency reported that during his meeting with Kushner, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa had praised the role the UAE has played in defending Arab and Islamic interests.
In Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Kushner discussed the need for the Palestinians and the Israelis to resume negotiations and reach a lasting peace, state news agency SPA reported.
The UAE, United States and Israel on Monday urged the Palestinians to ""re-engage"" with the Israelis, according to a joint statement carried by the Emirati state news agency. 
""DISGRACED FOREVER""
The Palestinians have denounced the UAE agreement with Israel, which they say violates a longstanding pan-Arab position that Israel could normalise relations only in return for land. The UAE says it obtained a major concession from Israel to halt plans to annexe territory on the occupied West Bank.
The Gulf Arab states are mainly ruled by Sunni Muslim monarchs who consider their biggest foe to be Shi'ite Iran, and Israel has long held out the promise that their common enemy could bring them together.
In a fiery speech on Tuesday, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said: “The Emiratis will be disgraced forever for this treachery against the Islamic world, Arab nations and Palestine.”
“The UAE, along with Israelis and evil Americans like the Jewish member of Trump’s family, are working together against the interests of the Islamic world,” Khamenei said, referring to Kushner, who is Jewish.
Asked about Khamenei’s remarks, UAE Foreign Ministry official Jamal Al-Musharakh told reporters in Abu Dhabi: “The path to peace and prosperity is not paved with incitement and hate speech.”
Israeli officials have played up the economic benefits of the UAE deal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said representatives of the two countries had signed an agreement on cooperation in financial services.
The state-run Abu Dhabi Investment Office and Invest in Israel, part of Israel's economy ministry, issued a joint statement saying they had agreed to set out a plan to establish formal cooperation.
The Gulf state's biggest lender First Abu Dhabi Bank (AD:FAB) later said it would open discussions with Israel lenders Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi.
Amid the historic normalisation talks, Kushner spent a morning meeting UAE military officials at an Abu Dhabi air base that houses U.S. military F-35 jets, advanced stealth aircraft which the Gulf state has long sought to buy despite Israeli objections.

The UAE has said normalisation should remove any hurdle blocking the sale. Netanyahu said on Monday Israel still opposes selling the jets to the UAE.

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>",Trump's physician denies president had a stroke in November,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump did not have a stroke and remains healthy, his physician said on Tuesday in response to a new book suggesting Vice President Mike Pence was put on standby to assume presidential powers during a sudden Trump medical visit last year. 
In the book, titled ""Donald Trump v. The United States,"" New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt writes that word went out in the West Wing around the time of the visit last November for the vice president to be on standby if Trump had to undergo a procedure that would required he be anesthetized, according to news outlets that obtained a copy.
The White House declined to comment on the book's assertion about Pence being put on standby, but Trump and his physician did appear to respond on Tuesday to author Don Winslow's posting on Twitter last month that Winslow had received three communications from administration whistleblowers that Trump had had ""a series of mini-strokes.""
""I can confirm that President Trump has not experienced nor been evaluated for a cerebrovascular accident (stroke), transient ischemic attack (mini stroke), or any acute cardiovascular emergencies, as have been incorrectly reported in the media,"" Dr. Sean Conley said in a statement.
""The president remains healthy and I have no concerns about his ability to maintain the rigorous schedule ahead of him. As stated in my last report, I expect him to remain fit to execute the duties of the Presidency,"" Conley added.
On Twitter, Trump also denied having suffered a series of mini-strokes.
At the time, the White House described Trump's unexpected and unscheduled visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center as a start to his annual physical that included a quick exam and some laboratory tests.
But the trip triggered questions on social media since it occurred months before the annual physical had been carried out in the past.
Trump, known for his love of hamburgers and well-done steaks and an aversion to the gym, gained weight from his physical in 2017, pushing his body mass index into the obese category.

LONDON (Reuters) - A Russian influence operation posed as an independent news outlet to target left-wing voters in the United States and Britain, including by recruiting freelance journalists to write about domestic politics, Facebook said on Tuesday.
 Facebook Inc  (O:FB) said the operation - which partly focused on U.S. politics and racial tensions in the run-up to the Nov. 3 presidential election - centred around a pseudo media organisation called Peace Data.
The website operated 13 Facebook accounts and two pages, which were set up in May and suspended on Monday for using fake identities and other forms of ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour,"" the company said. 
Facebook said its investigation ""found links to individuals associated with past activity by the Russian Internet Research Agency"", a St Petersburg-based company which U.S. intelligence officials say was central to Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election.
Twitter said it had also suspended five accounts as part of the operation which it could ""reliably attribute to Russian state actors."" 
Peace Data did not respond to an emailed request for comment and Russian officials were not immediately available after normal working hours in Moscow. Russia has previously denied U.S. allegations of trying to sway elections and says it does not interfere in the domestic politics of other countries. 
Investigators at social media analytics firm Graphika studied the operation and said Peace Data predominately targeted progressive and left-wing groups in the United States and Britain, but also posted about events in other countries including Algeria and Egypt.
It said in a report https://public-assets.graphika.com/reports/graphika_report_ira_again_unlucky_thirteen.pdf that the website pushed messages critical of right-wing voices and the centre left, and in the United States ""paid particular attention to racial and political tensions"", including civil rights protests and criticism of President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival, Joe Biden. 
Graphika said only around 5% of Peace Data's English-language articles directly concerned the U.S. election, but that ""this facet of the operation suggests an attempt to build a left-wing audience and steer it away from Biden's campaign.""
The findings support an assessment by the United States' top counterintelligence official last month, who said Moscow was using online disinformation to try to undercut the Biden campaign, and could stoke fears about further Russian efforts to interfere in the November vote.
A spokesman for the Trump campaign said the president would win re-election ""fair and square and we don’t need or want any foreign interference."" The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred questions to the FBI. In a statement, the FBI said it had flagged the activity to Facebook.
""The FBI provided information in this matter to better protect against threats to the nation's security and our democratic processes,"" the statement said.
INFORMATION PROVIDED BY FBI
Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said his team acted on the FBI's tip and suspended the accounts before they gathered a large online following. Only 14,000 people followed one or more of the suspended accounts, he said. 
""I think it's very important that we know about this,"" Gleicher told Reuters. ""I want people to know that Russian actors are still trying and their tactics are evolving, but I wouldn't want people to think that this was a large, successful campaign.""
Peace Data publishes in English and Arabic and says on its website it is a non-profit news organisation seeking ""the truth about key world events"".
But the three permanent staff listed online are not real, according to the Graphika analysis, which found the profiles used computer-generated photographs of non-existent people and were linked to fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter and business-networking site LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).
The fake personas advertised for writers on freelance journalism websites and Twitter, offering up to $75 for an article, screenshots of the adverts seen by Reuters showed.
Peace Data's website lists 22 ""contributors"", mostly freelance journalists in the United States and Britain. Facebook and Graphika said there was no indication the writers knew who was behind the website. 
Peace Data ""staff"" then shared the articles, covering a wide range of political issues, in left-wing social media groups, Graphika said. The website published over 700 articles in English and Arabic between February and August this year. 
Ben Nimmo, head of investigations at Graphika, said co-opting real people made it easier for political influence operations to remain undetected.

""What we've seen recently has been much smaller and much lower profile,"" he said. ""It looks like they're trying harder and harder to hide.""

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 05:36PM ET</span>",Los Angeles police fatally shoot Black man after suspected bike violation,"By Lucy Nicholson and Jonathan Allen
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A Black cyclist was fatally shot by Los Angeles County police, the latest instance of police killing a Black man, as the county Sheriff's Department and a lawyer representing the man's family gave diverging accounts of the shooting on Tuesday.
The cyclist, 29-year-old Dijon Kizzee, was shot more than 20 times in the back on Monday afternoon after two sheriff's deputies tried to stop him for a bicycle code violation, said Benjamin Crump, who said he is representing Kizzee's family.
The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said Kizzee, whose identity was confirmed by the county medical examiner-coroner, was shot fewer than 20 times after dropping a handgun he had been carrying and punching one of the deputies.
The killing renewed protests in the city by demonstrators angered at deadly violence against Black people by police. Such protests have become a near daily occurrence around the country after George Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer in May.
""You don't kill any race but us, and it don't make any sense,"" Fletcher Fair, Dijon Kizzee's aunt, told reporters at the site of the shooting on Tuesday where activists called for an independent investigation by California's attorney general. ""Why us?""
Protests also continued in Kenosha, Wisconsin, over a white police officer's shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, seven times in the back, leaving him paralyzed, and the unrest has become a major issue ahead of November's presidential election. 
President Donald Trump, a Republican, arrived in Kenosha on Tuesday as he seeks to rally his base of white supporters by defending police against criticism of brutality. 
Kizzee was riding his bike on Monday afternoon in Los Angeles County's Westmont neighborhood when two sheriff's deputies who had been driving by tried to stop him.
Kizzee abandoned his bike and ran for a block with the deputies in pursuit, Brandon Dean, a sheriff's department spokesman, told reporters on Monday evening. Kizzee then punched one of the deputies in the face, dropping a bundle of clothing he was carrying, the department said. 
The deputies said a semi-automatic handgun was in the dropped bundle, and both of them began shooting Kizzee, the department said.
Dean said he did not know what part of the bicycle code Kizzee was suspected to have violated or how many times the deputies shot him, other than saying it was fewer than 20. His office declined to answer questions about the shooting and the status of the two deputies on Tuesday.
The county coroner was due to conduct an autopsy on Kizzee on Tuesday. 
However, Crump, a civil rights lawyer known for representing Black victims of police violence around the country, wrote in a Twitter post: ""They say he ran, dropped clothes and handgun. He didn't pick it up, but cops shot him in the back 20+ times then left him for hours."" 
Crump asked on Twitter for people to send him any videos of the incident, saying that sheriff's deputies are not required to wear body cameras.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday overturned a ruling that barred U.S. immigration authorities from arresting immigrants who are in the country illegally when they make appearances at courthouses in Massachusetts cases.
The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston ruled that a judge abused her discretion in finding that prosecutors in two of Massachusetts' largest counties and public defenders could establish that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) lacked authority to conduct the civil arrests.
That June 2019 order was the first nationally to block ICE from carrying out courthouse arrests during an immigration crackdown overseen by Republican President Donald Trump's administration. A federal judge has similarly blocked such arrests in New York.
Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins (NYSE:ROL) and Middlesex County District Attorney Marian Ryan and others argued in a lawsuit that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) incorporated a long-standing legal principle against civil courthouse arrests.
But U.S. Circuit Judge Bruce Selya in Tuesday's ruling said that privilege against courthouse arrests was ""a dead letter"" when Congress passed the INA in 1952 and the court could not presume lawmakers intended to incorporate it into the law.
Selya, writing for a three-judge panel, said it was not for the court to decide whether ICE's strategy is sound public policy, saying ""that question lies within the domain of the politically accountable branches of the federal and state governments.""
Rollins and Ryan, both Democrats, did not respond to requests for comment.
In 2018, ICE adopted a directive to patrol courthouses in response to local governments refusing to transfer illegal immigrants to ICE upon their release from custody. Courthouses were one of the few reliable places to find people. 
The Massachusetts lawsuit came after federal prosecutors in April 2019 charged Newton District Court Judge Shelley Joseph, which is in Middlesex County, with obstructing ICE from arresting an illegal immigrant at her courthouse. Her lawyers called the case political.

The island was divided in 1974 following a Turkish invasion triggered by a Greek-inspired coup. Turkey recognises the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is not recognised by other countries. Several peacemaking efforts have collapsed.
Washington placed restrictions on the transfer of arms to Cyprus in 1987 to encourage reunification efforts and avoid an arms race on the island. 
""Cyprus is a key partner in the Eastern Mediterranean,"" he said on Twitter. ""We will waive restrictions on the sale of non-lethal defence articles and services to the Republic of Cyprus for the coming fiscal year.""
The decision comes amid escalating tensions in the eastern Mediterranean between NATO allies Turkey and Greece over claims to potential hydrocarbon resources in the eastern Mediterranean based on conflicting views on the extent of their continental shelves.
Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades said on Twitter after a phone call with Pompeo that he welcomed the move. 
Turkey's foreign ministry said the decision ""disregards the equality and balance"" on the island and that Ankara expects its NATO ally to ""review"" it.
""Otherwise, Turkey, as a guarantor country, will take the necessary reciprocal steps in line with its legal and historical responsibility to guarantee the security of the Turkish Cypriot people,"" it said in a statement.
Ankara and Athens both say they are ready to solve the dispute through dialogue, while insisting on upholding their own rights. They each held military exercises in the region, highlighting the potential for the dispute to escalate.

A chaotic network of metro trains and buses form the backbone of Mexico City's public transport system and was used on a daily basis prior to the pandemic by millions of commuters, often cramped elbow to elbow.
""Many people have opted to buy a bike and use it, out of fear of public transport, to get to work, to go out and about, to be active,"" said Valentin Najera, a capital bike shop owner.
He says business is booming.
""There has been an increase in sales since the pandemic.""
Mexico City's local government has taken notice of the shift and implemented new urban planning projects, including a recent announcement for more than 40 miles (64 kilometers) of exclusive bike lines.
They hope the shift among commuters stays around well after the pandemic is just a bad memory.
""I prefer to get on the bike rather than on the metro to not expose myself to the situation that we are going through. It's also a healthy habit,"" said cyclist Ivan Pastor.
Getting around on bike in the city, situated in a valley 2,240 meters (7,350 feet) above sea level, is good exercise and could also help reduce pollution from the metro area's legions of cars and trucks, many of them older models that belch out thick black smoke.
While city dwellers around the world take some consolation in improved air quality thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, pollution from nearby fossil fuel power plants, diesel-fueled generators as well as frequent forest fires have ensured Mexico City remains smog filled.

There has been a ""significant rise"" in cases of coronavirus being brought into Scotland, a devolved region of the United Kingdom, from people who have been to Greece, the Scottish government said on Tuesday.
""We are in the midst of a global pandemic and the situation in many countries can change suddenly. Therefore, people should think very hard before committing to non-essential travel abroad,"" said Humza Yousaf, Scotland's justice minister.
Meanwhile, the Welsh government has said holidaymakers returning to Wales from the Greek island of Zante are to be asked to quarantine for 14 days and be offered COVID-19 tests.
Britain's national government in London was expected to decide later this week whether to quarantine travellers returning from Greece, a decision that would apply to England.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Niger, the U.N. Security Council president for September, said on Tuesday it stands by a declaration that no further action can be taken on a U.S. bid to trigger a return of U.N. sanctions on Iran because there is no consensus in the 15-member body.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he triggered a 30-day process on Aug. 20 to reimpose all international sanctions on Iran - known as snapback - by lodging a complaint with the council accusing Iran of breaching a 2015 nuclear deal.
But Indonesia U.N. Ambassador Dian Triansyah Djani, the council president for August, said that he was ""not in the position to take further action"" because 13 council members had expressed their opposition.
""We're staying with this decision... that was stated and announced by the president of the Security Council last month,"" said Niger U.N. Ambassador Abdou Abarry, ruling out any move to put forward a draft resolution under the snapback process to extend sanctions relief for Iran.
But Abarry noted: ""Any other member state of the Security Council can do it. The United States themselves can do it.""
Washington would veto such a resolution, Pompeo posted on Twitter on Thursday, though he did not signal whether the United States would put forward such a text itself. He added that under the snapback process, ""if no resolution is introduced, the sanctions on Iran will still return on September 20.""
Thirteen council members argue that Washington's attempt to reimpose U.N. sanctions on Iran is void given it is using a process agreed under the nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers, which the United States quit in 2018.
The Dominican Republic is the only council member not to have stated a position on the U.S. move.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican activists have begun gathering signatures for a referendum on charging former presidents with graft, heeding calls by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who on Tuesday said he would respect the outcome of a public vote on the issue. 
While Lopez Obrador has said he does not favor bringing former presidents to trial, he has repeatedly called for the public to decide on the issue.
""I would vote to not put them on trial,"" he said in an annual state of the nation speech on Tuesday. ""However, if a (public) consultation takes place, I will respect the popular decision.""
Members of Lopez Obrador's MORENA party have been advising activists as they set up petition booths across Mexico in recent days. A website dedicated to the issue said 22,000 signatures had been gathered by Tuesday from the 1.8 million required.
""Anybody in any position should be judged just like any other person,"" said Berta Romero Cortez, a government worker who signed a petition in front of a poster of mugshot-style photos of former presidents. 
The debate about bringing charges against leaders, including Lopez Obrador's predecessor Enrique Pena Nieto, intensified in August after testimony from a senior politician outlined high-level bribery and vote buying in Congress in the last administration.
Corruption by former administrations is key to Lopez Obrador's emerging campaign for mid-term elections in June 2021. He says a vote on the issue should coincide with the elections.
Critics say Lopez Obrador is using corruption in previous administrations to distract from his handling of the economy and the coronavirus pandemic. 
Under Mexican law, activists have until Sept. 15 to collect the signatures, which will then be reviewed by electoral authorities before a decision is taken on the vote.

1485,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 03:20PM ET</span>",Head of Brazil's 'Car Wash' anti-graft task force quits with team's future in doubt,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - The head of Brazil's top corruption-busting team of federal prosecutors will quit the task force that dismantled the country's biggest graft network and jailed a former president for taking bribes, the team announced on Tuesday.
Deltan Dallagnol's departure comes at a time when the so-called ""Car Wash"" investigation, which began in 2014, has come under increasing pressure to be disbanded. The country's prosecutor general must take a decision by Sept. 10.
Dallagnol, a 40-year-old lawyer, said in a video posted on social media that he was stepping down as coordinator of the task force for personal reasons, saying he would look after an ill daughter aged 22 months.
""This is a very difficult decision. But I am very sure that this is the right decision that I want to take as a parent,"" he said.
Dallagnol, who has faced criticism from politicians for his aggressive methods in fighting pervasive corruption in Brazil, will be transferred to the federal prosecution office in the southern city of Curitiba, where the Car Wash operation is based.
The prosecutor called on Brazilians to continue supporting the task force. He said the fight against corruption is under risk by ""decisions made in Brasilia,"" an apparent reference to political interference.
Brazil's top public prosecutor, Augusto Aras, must decide by next week whether to extend the task force's mandate for another year, as skepticism grows about Bolsonaro's commitment to a campaign in which he promises to tackle corruption. 
The right-wing leader took office last year amid popular anger at corruption under the former governments of the leftist Workers Party, but has since railed at investigations of alleged graft involving members of his own family. 
With a raft of investigations on alleged corruption in the purchase of medical equipment to combat COVID-19, there are abundant signs that graft is thriving despite the years of prosecutions. 
A senior member of the task force, requesting anonymity, told Reuters last week that there were 400 ongoing probes by federal prosecutors and police stemming from the Car Wash investigation. 
Among the cases still open are investigations on contracts signed by state-controlled company Petrobras with several multinational firms, as well as deals by financial institutions and new probes of ship leasings, the source said.
Still in the pipeline are investigations of money laundering through art galleries and of politicians who are no longer in office and have lost their legal prerogatives, he said.

Uribe, who resigned from his Senate post last month, is under investigation for alleged witness tampering and is currently under house arrest.
His defense team requested his case be moved in August, saying the court does not have jurisdiction as he is no longer a lawmaker and because it is not related to his political activities.
The court agreed with Uribe's team, saying it is transferring the case to the attorney general ""because it relates to an investigation which is unrelated to his role as a congressman"" in a statement posted to its Twitter account 
The decision was unanimous, the statement added.
Uribe is being held under house arrest at his country home in Colombia's north. The court ordered his detention in August, citing a risk of obstruction of justice.
Uribe, perhaps the South American country's most polarizing politician, has questioned the independence of the court and said it violated due process. 
The former president has repeatedly declared his innocence amid accusations his allies manipulated witnesses in an attempt to discredit his alleged ties to paramilitaries.
Uribe's critics say his resignation from the Senate was a ploy to move the case to a potentially less rigorous legal body.
Uribe's house arrest is the first time the Supreme Court has ordered the detention of a former president. His allies, including current President Ivan Duque, have called for Uribe to be released.
Uribe's exit cost his Democratic Center party its main figurehead in Congress, just as Duque is trying to pass major justice and tax reforms.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Yolanda Bejarano flits between joy that Colombia's more than five months of quarantine are over and fear of coronavirus. 
Her fear is well-founded. Her brother died from COVID-19 a month ago, after being infected while working as a bus driver in capital Bogota.
""On the one hand I'm happy because we can start reopening the economy but on the other, I'm sad because many people aren't being careful, they think the pandemic is a joke,"" Bejarano said. ""Since God took my brother from us, I'm very afraid."" 
Colombia's long quarantine - begun in late March - ended on Tuesday. The Andean country has confirmed more than 615,000 coronavirus infections and close to 20,000 deaths.
Most of the economy - including road transport between cities and 15 airports operating at 20% of normal capacity - has now reopened, albeit with restrictions. 
""We're starting this new phase with one message, that we must keep our guard up, we can't go out willy-nilly ... we have to understand that to reopen the country our responsibility is paramount,"" President Ivan Duque said in a televised broadcast on Monday night. 
The long-running lockdown led Latin America's fourth-largest economy to contract 15.7% in the second quarter, while unemployment has shot to a record of almost 25%.
""These past months with shops closed were very tricky, very difficult, with companies in crisis,"" said Rafael Aaron, a representative for a textiles factory, after disembarking a flight from second city Medellin. 
""Hopefully we can get on with our work,"" he said.
SLOW RECOVERY
Aaron's (NYSE:AAN) optimism was not echoed by all business owners.
Nicolas Nader and his business partners were forced to dissolve their company Barra 3 after closing three of the six bars and restaurants they operated. 
""What's going to happen now? I don't know, such uncertainty is unknown to us,"" said Nader, whose company is now called Food Hub, referring to what he said were contradictory messages from national and local governments. 
While restaurants are able to open, they can only operate at 25% capacity. 
Local authorities can restrict movement during September's ""selective"" quarantine, while sectors including retail, manufacturing, restaurants and other businesses can only operate on certain days, threatening delays to economic recovery.
""When retail is closed or restricted, the entire chain of production slows down,"" said Juan Esteban Orrego, the National Retailers Association's director for Bogota. ""It's still not profitable."" 
According to Fenalco close to 58,000 retailers, some 31% of those operating in the capital, have closed.
Some 41,000 of Colombia's 90,000 restaurants will not reopen according to the Acodres restaurant association. 
""Many businesses, which managed to hold on until now, won't last during this month or the next two months of trial and error,"" said Nader.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 02:22PM ET</span>",Special Report: Pentagon's latest salvo against China's growing might - Cold War bombers,"By David Lague
HONG KONG (Reuters) - On July 21, two U.S Air Force B-1B bombers took off from Guam and headed west over the Pacific Ocean to the hotly contested South China Sea. The sleek jets made a low-level pass over the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and its escorting fleet, which was exercising nearby in the Philippines Sea, according to images released by the U.S. military.
The operation was part of the Trump administration's intensifying challenge to China's ruling Communist Party and its sweeping territorial claims over one of the world's most important strategic waterways. While senior Trump officials launch diplomatic and rhetorical broadsides at Beijing, the U.S. Defense Department is turning to the firepower of its heavily armed, long-range bombers as it seeks to counter Beijing's bid to control the seas off the Chinese coast.
Since late January, American B-1B and B-52 bombers, usually operating in pairs, have flown about 20 missions over key waterways, including the South China Sea, the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan, according to accounts of these flights from U.S. Air Force statements and official social media posts. These missions, military analysts say, are designed to send a crystal-clear signal: The United States can threaten China's fleet and Chinese land targets at any time, from distant bases, without having to move America's aircraft carriers and other expensive surface warships within range of Beijing's massive arsenal of missiles.
In this response to the growing power of China's military, the Pentagon has combined some of its oldest weapons with some of its newest: Cold War-era bombers and cutting-edge, stealthy missiles. The supersonic B1-B first entered service in 1986; the newest plane in the B-52 fleet was built during the Kennedy administration. But these workhorses can carry a huge payload of precision weapons. A B-1B can carry 24 of the U.S. military's stealthy new Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles, which entered service in 2018 and can strike targets at ranges of up to 600 kilometers, according to U.S. and other Western officials.
""A single B-1 can deliver the same ordnance payload as an entire carrier battle group in a day,"" said David Deptula, dean of the Washington-based Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies and a retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General. And, in a crisis, he added, bombers can be rapidly deployed.
""Depending on where they are, ships can take weeks to get in place,"" said Deptula. ""But by using bombers, they can respond in a matter of hours,"" he adds, noting that the U.S. object is to deter war. ""Nobody wants to engage in conflict with China.""
Chinese and western military strategists warn that a conflict between the two nuclear-armed powers could be difficult to contain.
In a clash with China, this fast response from the bomber force could be vital while the U.S. and its allies rush naval reinforcements to the Pacific to bolster the vastly outnumbered U.S. naval fleet stationed in the region, according to current and former U.S. and other Western military officers.
A spokeswoman for Pacific Air Forces, Captain Veronica Perez, said the U.S. Air Force had increased its publicity about its bomber missions to assure allies and partners of Washington's commitment to global security, regional stability and a free and open Indo-Pacific. ""Though the frequency and scope of our operations vary based on the current operating environment, the U.S. has a persistent military presence and routinely operates throughout the Indo-Pacific,"" she said.
China's defense ministry did not respond to questions from Reuters.
LOWEST POINT
While the bomber missions continue, relations between Washington and Beijing have reached their lowest point since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown. In a show of force, Chinese fighter jets crossed the mid-line of the Taiwan Strait while U.S. Secretary for Health, Alex Azar, was visiting Taipei on Aug. 10 to congratulate the government of President Tsai Ing-wen on its successful containment of the COVID-19 virus. Azar was the most senior American official to visit Taiwan in four decades.
Taiwan's missile radars tracked the Chinese fighters in only the third such incursion across the median line since 2016, the Taiwanese government said. Beijing condemned the visit. It regards the island as a province of China and hasn't ruled out the use of force to bring it under Communist Party control.
In a series of speeches ahead of Azar's visit, top Trump officials had hammered China on multiple fronts, including its military build-up, territorial ambitions, domestic political repression, intellectual property theft, espionage, trade practices and its failure to alert the world to the danger of COVID-19.
In one of the most harshly worded attacks on China from an American official in decades, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on July 23 that China's military, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), was not a normal fighting force.
""Its purpose is to uphold the absolute rule of the Chinese Communist Party elites and expand a Chinese empire, not protect the Chinese people,"" he said. ""And so our Department of Defense has ramped up its efforts, freedom of navigation operations out and throughout the East and South China Seas and in the Taiwan Strait as well."" In July, Pompeo declared most of Beijing's claims of sovereignty over the South China Sea illegal.
With the combination of bombers and long-range missiles, the United States is trying to turn the tables on the PLA. Over more than two decades, China has assembled a force of ground, sea and air-launched missiles that would make it deadly for warships of the U.S. Navy and its allies to approach the Chinese coast in a conflict. This Chinese strategy is specifically tailored to threaten U.S. aircraft carrier battle groups and the network of bases that form the backbone of American power in Asia.
In a demonstration of this capability, the PLA launched one of its so-called carrier-killer missiles, the DF-26, in an exercise in the South China Sea following the deployment in July of two U.S. aircraft carriers to the area, China's official military media reported in early August. And a U.S. defense official told Reuters that on Aug. 26, China launched four medium-range ballistic missiles that hit the South China Sea between Hainan Island and the Paracel Islands.
But the PLA Navy's huge and rapidly expanding fleet is also vulnerable to long-range missiles. China has built the world's biggest navy, including new aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships and powerful cruisers and destroyers. And the PLA's extensive network of bases and ports would also be targets for missiles.
In a conflict, U.S. bombers over the Western Pacific could target PLA Navy warships at their bases on the Chinese coast or underway inside the so-called first island chain, the string of islands that run from the Japanese archipelago through Taiwan, the Philippines and on to Borneo, enclosing China's coastal seas. Chinese warships would be even more vulnerable if they broke out through the island chain into the Western Pacific, outside the coverage of the PLA's land-based air defenses and strike aircraft.
THE FIREPOWER GAP
In the aftermath of the Cold War, Washington assumed it had uncontested control of the oceans and neglected to arm its surface fleet with modern, long-range anti-ship missiles. To be sure, the U.S. and its allies, particularly Japan, still have a powerful fleet of attack submarines that would pose a deadly menace to PLA warships. But the bombers help fill the firepower gap in the U.S. surface fleet while the Pentagon is re-purposing existing missiles and introducing new versions to its destroyers and cruisers, according to maritime strategists.
The bomber deployments are one element of a much wider reshaping of forces and tactics that the U.S. and its allies in East Asia have launched to deter China from attacking Taiwan, expanding its hold over the South China Sea or seizing other disputed territories. These include the uninhabited group of isles in the East China Sea known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan and the Diaoyu Islands in China, which are claimed by both Tokyo and Beijing.
Tensions are on the rise around these islands, now under Japanese control. The commander of U.S. forces in Japan, Lieutenant General Kevin Schneider, pledged in July that America would help Japan monitor ""unprecedented"" Chinese incursions into waters around the Senkakus that were challenging Tokyo's administration. Within an hour of Schneider's comments, China's foreign ministry fired back that the islands were ""Chinese territory.""
Long-range U.S. bombers operating from distant airfields would remain a threat if Chinese missile attacks disabled key U.S. bases in Japan, South Korea and Guam. These bases, mostly a carry-over from World War Two and the Korean War, were built at a time when China had very limited means to attack them.
Now it does. In a clear acknowledgement that Guam is now at risk, the U.S. Air Force announced on April 17 it would end its continuous rotation of bombers to the island base and withdraw them to the U.S. mainland.
The absence of a permanent bomber presence at Guam is a blow to Washington's ability to deter China and North Korea, airpower experts say. The island in the Western Pacific is less than a five-hour flight from the South China Sea.
""It makes it look like the Chinese military build-up has worked,"" said Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at Griffith University in Australia and a retired Australian air force Group Captain who has worked at the Pentagon. ""They are now taken out of range.""
Since then, the United States has sent bombers to Guam for short-term deployments from their continental bases. U.S. airpower researchers suggest that the availability of better training facilities at mainland U.S. bases was also a factor in the decision to withdraw the bombers. But in further evidence of Guam's vulnerability, the head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Philip Davidson, has asked Congress to fund a powerful missile defense system for the island by 2026.
Another hurdle for the Pentagon: America's bomber force is shrinking just as the PLA challenge grows. From a force of more than 400 at the end of the Cold War, the U.S. bomber fleet has shrunk to 158 aircraft. Of those planes, 62 are B-1Bs and 76 are B-52S. The United States also has a smaller force of 20 newer B-2 stealth bombers.
The air force plans to retire 17 B-1Bs next year to concentrate resources on the remaining bombers until the planned introduction of a new generation of stealthy bomber, the B-21, toward the end of this decade. This bomber is expected to sharply improve the U.S. Air Force's ability to penetrate Chinese airspace.  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) is now building the first prototype, according to air force officials.
'NOT LIKE FIGHTING SADDAM'
As the risk of conflict rises, some Western airpower experts doubt that U.S. bombers would deliver a decisive advantage in a clash with the PLA. They say the Chinese military has spent decades preparing formidable, integrated air defenses. Even if the U.S. bombers were able to sink PLA Navy warships and stealthily penetrate Chinese airspace to strike some ground targets, they say it would not necessarily translate into victory against a vast and powerful adversary.
And, they warn, it might be impossible to fight a limited conflict on China's periphery. ""It is not like fighting Saddam Hussein, it would be a major world war,"" said Layton, the retired Australian air force officer. ""Both sides have nuclear weapons and there is the potential for escalation. If either side is losing, what is going to happen then?""
Alongside relying on its bombers, the United States has been forced to develop other plans to offset the Chinese missile and naval threat. The U.S Marine Corps is planning to disperse smaller units armed with long-range anti-ship and land-attack missiles through the first island chain, where they could threaten the Chinese navy and land targets on China's mainland.
The U.S. Army also intends to spread forces through the first island chain and other outposts in the Western Pacific. It is planning a series of major exercises this year and next where troops would deploy to islands in the region, according to senior commanders and top Pentagon officials.
New weapons are in the pipeline that would give specially formed army task force units the firepower to strike at Chinese warships and other targets in a conflict. The U.S. Army's top commander, General James McConville, told an online seminar hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies in late July that a very long-range hypersonic missile was under development and tests had been successful. And soldiers would have the tools to attack an enemy's navy. ""We are going to have mid-range missiles that can sink ships,"" McConville said.
The U.S. and its allies also intend to link all their surveillance systems and weapons together in a regional network so that tracking information about a target could be shared between radar stations, satellites, surface warships, submarines, aircraft and land forces. In this system, a stealth fighter flying from a carrier could detect an enemy warship and relay this information to an army unit on an island, which could attack the foe with an anti-ship missile.
On May 21, two U.S. B-1B bombers from Guam flew to an area near Misawa Air Base in Japan, where they conducted long-range anti-ship missile training with a P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft and the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, according to a U.S. Pacific Air Force statement. This exercise demonstrated that the U.S. had the capability to ""hold any target at risk, anytime and anywhere,"" said Perez, the Pacific Air Forces spokeswoman.
The ships and aircraft involved in this exercise likely practised the sharing of target information to mount a simulated attack, according to U.S. and Asian military experts. On other missions this year, the American bombers have held joint exercises with U.S., Japanese and South Korean fighters.
CHINESE AIRSPACE
In this networked battlefield, the Pentagon's old warhorses of the air would be an even more formidable rival.
The speed and range of America's Cold War-vintage bombers would allow them to approach Chinese targets from different directions and fire salvos of difficult-to-detect missiles at multiple ships, according to current and retired U.S. air force officers. With even longer range missiles that Washington has in the pipeline, such attacks could be mounted from well outside the range of China's powerful, land-based air defenses. American bombers can also drop precision-guided mines to block strategically important ocean passages or ports.
And the U.S. B-2 stealth bombers could penetrate more deeply into Chinese airspace and attack key targets with sharply less chance of detection than the older bombers. These bombers already carry a heavy payload of precision, land-attack munitions and could also be configured to carry the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile.
A B-1B could take off from the continental United States, refuel from tanker aircraft en route, and arrive over the Western Pacific in about 15 hours, according to Deptula and other military aviation analysts. From Hawaii the trip would take about nine hours, they say. Even closer, from northern Australia, the transit would take six hours without refuelling.
The Australian government announced in February it would spend $814 million upgrading a key air base at Tindal in the Northern Territory, including a major extension to its runway. Part of the reason for the upgrade is to support expanded U.S. Air Force operations, the Australian government said. American bombers are already using the base.
The B-1B originally served as a nuclear bomber. That role has been phased out. It now carries around 34 metric tonnes (75,000 pounds) of conventional guided and unguided weapons, the biggest payload of any U.S. aircraft. In the military operations launched after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, these bombers were flown hard for almost two decades to provide ground support to American and allied troops in the Middle East and Afghanistan.
With the Pentagon having turned its competitive sights on China, the B-1B is now increasingly employed as a ship killer. In future, it could also be armed with a new hypersonic missile, the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), now in testing, and a new long-range cruise missile, according to senior U.S. Air Force commanders. Hypersonic missiles traveling at more than five times the speed of sound would be hard to intercept.
The B-52 is an even older icon of American might, in service since the mid-1950s. It carries a slightly smaller payload than the B-1B. As part of this weapons load, it can be armed with up to 14 upgraded versions of the Cold War-era Harpoon anti-ship missile. And, it could also be configured in future to carry 20 Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles, according to air power experts. Along with the B-2, the B-52 can also launch nuclear missiles.
While these older bombers remain potent, American air power experts say a strong force of B-21 stealth bombers will be much more effective when they begin entering service later this decade. The new bomber is being developed in a highly classified program. ""All the indications are that it is proceeding well in the development phases,"" said Deptula.

1489,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",Police arrest 19 protesters in Portland as political divide hardens,"By Deborah Bloom
PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - Protests flared in Portland overnight on Monday as demonstrators clashed with police on the streets of the Oregon city, which has become a focus of the U.S. presidential race after months of sometimes violent confrontations.
The latest protest came the night before President Donald Trump was due to visit Kenosha, Wisconsin, another flashpoint, having seized on civil disturbances in Portland and other cities to criticize Democratic leaders and call for ""law and order"" ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.
Democratic challenger Joe Biden on Monday said it was Trump himself who was helping stoke the violence.
In the latest Portland unrest, police used smoke grenades and pepper balls to control the crowd of protesters. Police said in a statement officers ""deployed some crowd control munitions"" and 19 people were arrested, mostly on charges of disorderly conduct and interfering with police.
About 200-300 people gathered in the downtown area to march to the apartment of Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler to demand his resignation. They were seen setting fire to wooden benches and plastic trash bins along the march.
Portland has seen nightly protests with hundreds of arrests since the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, in Minneapolis on May 25. Kenosha was thrust into the spotlight after police shot a Black man in the back on Aug. 23.
Police declared Monday night's gathering unlawful and later upgraded it to a riot after protesters set a fire in an unoccupied apartment building. 
The area was secured to allow firefighters to respond to the situation, police said.
In recent weeks, tensions between right- and left-wing groups in the city have roiled downtown. 
Trump supporters have converged on the city as counterdemonstrators, including one man who was fatally shot on Saturday night. Nobody has been charged in that case as police review poor-quality video of the incident.
State police and officers from neighboring suburbs were sent to Portland on Monday following the shooting.
The federal government had previously sent tactical officers into Portland but started withdrawing in late July after discussions with Oregon Governor Kate Brown, who said on Twitter that the federal officers ""acted as an occupying force & brought violence.""
Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf urged Portland's Democratic mayor Ted Wheeler to request federal assistance.
""We are standing by to support Portland. At the same time, President Trump has made it abundantly clear that there will come a point when state and local officials fail to protect its citizens from violence, the federal government will have no choice but to protect our American citizens,"" Wolf said in a letter to Wheeler.
The Trump administration appeared to be responding to Wheeler's open letter to Trump on Friday in which he rejected the U.S. president's offer to redeploy federal agents in Portland.

""No thanks,"" Wheeler wrote. ""We don't need your politics of division and demagoguery.""

1491,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 01:32PM ET</span>",Macron tells Lebanese leaders to reform swiftly or face sanctions,"By Raya Jalabi and Yara Abi Nader
BEIRUT (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron has warned Lebanese politicians they risk sanctions if they fail to set the nation on a new course within three months, stepping up pressure for reforms in a country collapsing under the weight of an economic crisis.
Visiting for the second time in less than a month, Macron marked Lebanon's centenary by traveling to a forest outside Beirut to plant a cedar tree, the emblem of a nation facing the biggest threat to its stability since the 1975-1990 civil war.
In central Beirut, riot police and armored personnel carriers fired teargas to disperse protesters outside parliament as they vented anger at the mismanagement and corruption that has dragged Lebanon into crisis. Some protesters hurled rocks.
Riot police also deployed outside the venue where Macron met Lebanese political and religious leaders. One group held a banner reading: ""Legitimacy comes from the people.""
""It's the last chance for this system,"" Macron told POLITICO. ""I am putting the only thing I have on the table: my political capital.""
Macron, who toured Beirut's port that was devastated in an Aug. 4 explosion, adding to the national crisis, said he wanted ""credible commitments"" and a follow-up mechanism from Lebanon's leaders, including a legislative election in six to 12 months. 
Should they fail to shift in the next three months, punitive measures could be imposed, including withholding bailout money and sanctions on the ruling class, the French president said.
Lebanese politicians, some former warlords who have overseen decades of industrial-scale corruption, face a daunting task with an economy in meltdown, a swathe of Beirut in tatters after the port blast and sectarian tensions rising.
Pressure from Macron, who said he would visit again in December, has already pushed major parties to agree on a new prime minister, Mustapha Adib, who has called for the rapid formation of a government and promised to implement reforms swiftly to secure a deal with the International Monetary Fund.
Forming a cabinet has taken months in the past. But Macron said he would push politicians to move fast and said billions of dollars in funds pledged at a 2018 Paris donor conference in Paris would not be released without reforms.
FOREIGN INFLUENCE
Macron, who visited Beirut in early August aftermath the port blast that killed more than 190 people, said world powers must stay focused on the emergency in Lebanon for six weeks.
He said Paris was ready to help organize and host an international conference with the United Nations in October.
Although Macron has taken center stage in demanding change, other foreign powers still exercise big influence on Lebanon, notably Iran through the heavily armed Shi'ite group Hezbollah.
A senior envoy from the United States, which classifies Hezbollah a terrorist organization and which has pumped money into the Lebanon's army, is due in Beirut on Wednesday.
Saudi Arabia has also traditionally exercised sway through Lebanon's Sunni community.
As Macron planted the cedar sapling, the French air force flew overhead, leaving smoke trails of red, white and green, the national colors of Lebanon whose borders were proclaimed by France 100 years ago in an imperial carve-up with Britain. It gained independence in 1943.
Macron began his trip on Monday by meeting Fairouz, 85, one of the Arab world's most famous singers whose music transcends Lebanon's divisions. Outside her home, protesters waved banners. One read: ""No cabinet by, or with, the murderers.""
Crushed by a mountain of debt, Lebanon's currency has collapsed and depositors have been frozen out of their increasingly worthless savings in a paralyzed banking system. Poverty and unemployment have soared.
""Today everything is blocked and Lebanon can no longer finance itself,"" Macron said, adding the central bank and banking system were in crisis and an audit was needed.

""We need to know the truth of the numbers, so that judicial actions can then be taken,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Tuesday pledged to publish draft legislation for a new Scottish independence referendum, including the question and timing of the vote, before the country's parliamentary election next year.
Sturgeon, who heads Edinburgh's pro-independence devolved government, put on hold plans for a second referendum in March to concentrate on the coronavirus crisis. However, the most sustained support for Scottish independence in the modern era has prompted nationalists to renew their push for another vote.
In a 2014 referendum on independence, Scots voted 55%-45% to stay in the United Kingdom.
""Before the end of this parliament, we will publish a draft bill setting out the proposed terms and timing of an independence referendum as well as the proposed question that people will be asked in that referendum,"" Sturgeon said.
Perceptions that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has responded slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic and Scots' anger over the UK's decision to leave the European Union has led for the first time to sustained support of over 50% for independence. Scottish voters opposed leaving the EU in a 2016 referendum.
If Scotland voted for independence it would mean the United Kingdom would lose about a third of its landmass, almost a tenth of its population, a core ingredient of its identity, and rip apart the world's sixth-biggest economy.
Next year's election to the devolved parliament is expected to provide a fresh platform for the Scottish National Party to press for a new referendum. The nationalists are expected to win a majority and aim to use that mandate to push Johnson to grant a fresh vote on the issue.
However, it is ultimately up to the British parliament to decide whether Scotland can hold another referendum, and Johnson’s Conservative government in London has repeatedly said it will reject any demand for a fresh vote.
Instead, Johnson's government is reemphasizing the economic advantages to Scotland of remaining in the United Kingdom with England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday it was implementing new compliance reforms at the FBI to minimize errors when it applies for wiretaps, following revelations it made numerous mistakes during its probe into President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign.
Attorney General William Barr released two new memos outlining sweeping changes, including the creation of a new internal auditing office as well as a list of additional steps the FBI must undertake before filing an application with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
Under the new protocol, if the FBI is seeking to monitor communications of an elected official or candidate, the director must first consider offering the target a defensive briefing, and the wiretap application must be approved by the Attorney General.
""The additional reforms announced today, which we worked on closely with the Attorney General's office, will build on the FBI's efforts to bolster its compliance program,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement.
The reforms could help take some heat off the bureau, which has been under fire for missteps in its early-stage investigation known as ""Operation Crossfire Hurricane"" into whether Trump's 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia.

In December, the department's inspector released a major report scrutinizing the FBI's FISA applications to spy on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser.
He uncovered 17 major mistakes in the FBI's applications - errors that were so substantial, they prompted a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge to issue a rare public rebuke of the FBI.
His findings have also since led to criminal charges against former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith, who in August pleaded guilty to doctoring in email used as a basis to renew an application to monitor Page.

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>","Pentagon concerned by China's nuclear ambitions, expects warheads to double","By Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China is expected to at least double the number of its nuclear warheads over the next decade from the low 200s now and is nearing the ability to launch nuclear strikes by land, air and sea, a capacity known as a triad, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.
The revelations came as tensions rise between China and the United States and as Washington seeks to have Beijing join a flagship nuclear arms treaty between the United States and Russia.
In its annual report to Congress on China's military, the Pentagon said that China has nuclear warheads in the low 200s, the first time the U.S. military has disclosed this number. The Federation of American Scientists has estimated that China has about 320 nuclear warheads.
The Pentagon said the growth projection was based on factors including Beijing having enough material to double its nuclear weapons stockpile without new fissile material production.
The Pentagon's estimate is in line with an analysis by the Defense Intelligence Agency.
""We're certainly concerned about the numbers ... but also just the trajectory of China's nuclear developments writ large,"" Chad Sbragia, deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, told reporters.
Earlier this year, China's Communist Party-backed newspaper Global Times said Beijing needs to expand the number of its nuclear warheads to 1,000 in a relatively short time. 
Sbragia said China was also nearing completion of its nuclear triad capacity, suggesting China is further along than previously publicly known. China has only two of the three legs of triad operational but is developing a nuclear capable air-launched ballistic missile. 
The report said that in October 2019, China publicly revealed the H-6N bomber as its first nuclear capable air-to-air refueling bomber. 
Washington has repeatedly called for China to join in trilateral negotiations to extend New START, a U.S.-Russian nuclear arms treaty that is due to expire in February.
China has said it has no interest in joining the negotiation, given that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is about 20 times the size of China's.
In July, a senior Chinese diplomat said Beijing would ""be happy to"" participate in trilateral arms control negotiations, but only if the United States were willing to reduce its nuclear arsenal to China's level.
China's growing nuclear arsenal should not be used as an excuse for the United States and Russia not to extend New START, Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association advocacy group, said.
It ""further reinforces the importance of extending New START and the folly of conditioning extension on China and China's participation in arms control,"" Reif added.
China's nuclear arsenal is a fraction of the United States', which has 3,800 nuclear warheads stockpiled, and Russia's, which has roughly 4,300, according to the Federation of American Scientists. 
""PREVENT TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE""
Tensions have been simmering between China and the United States for months. Washington has taken issue with China's handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak and moves to curb freedoms in Hong Kong. The increasingly aggressive posture comes as President Donald Trump bids for re-election in November.
Another source of tension has been Taiwan. China has stepped up its military activity around the democratic island Beijing claims as sovereign Chinese territory, sending fighter jets and warships on exercises close to Taiwan.

The Pentagon report, based on 2019 information, said China's military continued to ""enhance its readiness"" to prevent Taiwan's independence and carry out an invasion if needed.

1495,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 12:10PM ET</span>","Amid talks with Israel, UAE pursuit of stealth jets rumbles in background","By Lisa Barrington and Dan Williams (NYSE:WMB)
Al DHAFRA AIRBASE, Abu Dhabi (Reuters) - Amid historic normalization talks between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, American officials spent a morning at an Abu Dhabi air base housing U.S. stealth jets which the Gulf state hopes to buy despite Israeli objections.
White House senior adviser Jared Kushner met Emirati military officials at the UAE's Al Dhafra air base, where the U.S. keeps some of its F-35 advanced stealth warplanes, highlighting the UAE's years-long drive to obtain the aircraft. 
Israel, which has the F-35, has balked at any other Middle East powers obtaining the plane, citing U.S. laws that it should maintain a military advantage in the region.
Kushner, son-in-law to U.S. President Donald Trump, arrived in the Gulf Arab state on Monday on a two-day trip with an Israeli delegation for talks with UAE officials following their U.S.-brokered Aug. 13 accord to normalize relations.
The Gulf state, one of Washington's closest Middle East allies, has long expressed interest in acquiring the fighter jet made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) , which Israel has used in combat.
UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash has said normalization should remove ""any hurdle"" for the United States to sell the F-35 to the UAE.
A UAE official said the visit to the Emirati air base, which the U.S. also uses, near the UAE capital Abu Dhabi was not related to the F-35 issue, while another praised three decades of U.S.-UAE military cooperation.
""Our relationship has been built on trust and mutual support,"" Major General Falah al-Qahtani told reporters. ""We have stood together to fight extremism in all of its forms.""
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday F-35 plane sales were not part of the deal with the UAE, underscoring Israel's concern not to dilute its access to advanced American weapons systems in the region. 
""The Americans acknowledged that. Our position hasn't changed,"" Netanyahu said. 
He said that White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien made clear to him during a visit to Israel this week that the United States is committed to preserving Israel's military edge in the volatile region.
The United States has sold the F-35 to allies including Turkey, South Korea, Japan and Israel.
""The F-35 issue is a long-standing request of the UAE and it's not by any means a driver of reaching this accord,"" Jamal Al-Musharakh, chief of policy planning and international cooperation at the UAE foreign ministry, told reporters.
Kushner, who traveled on to Bahrain from the UAE on Tuesday, said he hoped another Arab country would normalize ties with Israel within months. 

No other Arab state has said so far it is considering following the UAE. Several have ruled out normalization under current conditions. Only two other Arab states have forged full relations with Israel - Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994.

Unions, led by the United Federation of Teachers, had expressed concern that the city was rushing into its Sept. 10 scheduled start of the school year without taking adequate steps to protect teachers, students and staff from infections.
But in announcing the agreement, de Blasio was joined by union leaders who said their health and safety concerns had been met.
""What we've agreed to is to make sure that the health measures are in place, to make sure there is time for the appropriate preparation for our educators,"" de Blasio said at a briefing.
UFT President Michael Mulgrew last month threatened to strike, which would be illegal under state law, unless schools implemented a rigorous COVID-19 testing plan and other safety measures.
Joining de Blasio, however, Mulgrew hailed the agreement.
""Our medical experts have stamped this plan, and we now can say that the New York City public school system has the most aggressive policies and greatest safeguards of any school system in America,"" said Mulgrew whose union represents 133,000 teachers and other education workers.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's foreign ministry on Tuesday accused Chinese troops of taking ""provocative actions"" on the disputed Himalayan mountain border while commanders from both sides were holding talks on Monday to defuse tensions between the Asian giants.
""Due to timely defensive action, the Indian side was able to prevent these attempts from unilaterally altering the status quo,"" ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said in a statement.
Indian troops had deployed on four strategic hilltops after what New Delhi called an attempted Chinese incursion along a border in the western Himalayan region of Ladakh over the weekend, an Indian official said.
China denied that it started the latest flare-up, with an embassy spokeswoman in New Delhi accusing Indian troops of trespassing across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) - the de facto border - and conducting ""flagrant provocations"". 
Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a border confrontation for months in the high-altitude snow deserts of Ladakh, and have held talks to reduce friction. The two have disputed the course of the frontier for over half a century.
The Indian official, who was briefed on the latest incident, said the Indian troop move responded to an attempt by a large number of Chinese infantry to push through a key mountain pass late on Saturday.
""We mobilized and occupied the four heights,"" the official said, adding all four hilltops were on India's side of the LAC.
The Indian official said the Chinese soldiers were backed up by military vehicles and drew close enough to engage Indian troops in verbal arguments, but there were no clashes.
He said the incident occurred on the southern bank of Pangong Tso, a picturesque lake where Indian and Chinese troops have been facing off since April.
The Indian official said the Chinese had also been consolidating positions on the northern bank of the lake with what appeared to be new defensive positions.
But Ji Rong, a spokeswoman for the Chinese embassy in New Delhi, said Indian troops had violated the LAC at Pangong Tso's southern bank and near another mountain pass.
""What India has done runs counter to the efforts made by both sides for a period of time to ease and cool down the situation on the ground, and China is resolutely opposed to this,"" she said.
""India...said it pre-empted Chinese military activity,"" China's state-backed Global Times said in an editorial. ""The word 'pre-empt' shows it was Indian troops that first took destructive action, and the Indian troops initiated the stand-off this time.""
In June, 20 Indian soldiers were killed in hand-to-hand combat with Chinese troops in Ladakh's Galwan area, the most serious clash between the two countries in 50 years.

Both sides then agreed to pull back with military chiefs in the region holding five rounds of talks. But the Indian military said this week Beijing had reneged on the deal by carrying out ""provocative military movements to change the status quo"".

1498,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 10:46AM ET</span>",Charlie Hebdo re-runs Prophet Mohammad cartoons to mark attack trial,"PARIS (Reuters) - French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo is republishing caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad which unleashed a wave of anger in the Muslim world to mark the start of the trial of alleged accomplices in the militant attack against it 2015.
Among the cartoons, most of which were first published by a Danish newspaper in 2005 and then by Charlie Hebdo a year later, is one of Mohammad wearing a bomb-shaped turban with a lit fuse protruding.
""We will never lie down. We will never give up,"" editor Laurent ""Riss"" Sourisseau wrote in a piece to accompany the front cover that will be published in print on Wednesday.
Twelve people, including some of the magazine's best-known cartoonists, were killed when Said and Cherif Kouachi stormed the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo and sprayed the building with automatic gunfire.
The Kouachi brothers and a third Islamist gunman who killed five people in the 48 hours that followed the Charlie Hebdo massacre were shot dead by police in different stand-offs, but 14 of their alleged accomplices go on trial on Wednesday.
The decision to republish the cartoons will be seen by some as a defiant gesture in defense of free expression. But others may see it as a renewed provocation by a magazine that has long courted controversy with its satirical attacks on religion.
After the 2006 publication of the cartoons, Jihadists online warned the weekly would pay for its mockery. For Muslims, any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous. 
""The freedom to caricature and the freedom to dislike them are enshrined and nothing justifies violence,"" the French Council of the Muslim Faith wrote on Twitter in response.
Muslims have previously said the turban cartoon branded all Muslims as terrorists, as did a Charlie Hebdo cartoon showing the Prophet reacting to Islamist militants by saying: “It’s hard to be loved by idiots.”
In 2007, a French court rejected accusations by Islamic groups that the publication incited hatred against Muslims.

Rusesabagina was played by Don Cheadle in the Oscar-nominated film 'Hotel Rwanda', which told how hotel manager Rusesabagina used his job and his connections with the Hutu elite to protect Tutsis fleeing the slaughter. 
Rwandan police said Rusesabagina - who called for armed resistance to the government in a YouTube video - was arrested on terrorism charges on an international arrest warrant. His family dispute that.
""He was kidnapped and taken by extraordinary rendition to Rwanda,"" his daughter Carine Kanimba posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
The spokesman for the Rwanda Investigation Bureau did not respond to a request for comment. The ministers for justice and foreign affairs did not respond to messages seeing comment. 
Another daughter, Anaise, told the BBC World Service radio that her father had last called them on Thursday from Dubai. 
""I believe he was kidnapped because he would never go to Rwanda on his own will,"" Anaise told the BBC.
Authorities in Dubai, part of the United Arab Emirates, did not return calls seeking comment on the arrest or whether the two nations have an extradition agreement. 
Rusesabagina moved abroad after the genocide and won worldwide acclaim, receiving the United States' highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 2005.
But some genocide survivors and President Paul Kagame have disputed Rusesabagina's account of rescuing Tutsis or accused him of exploiting the genocide for commercial gain. 
Rusesabagina, whose father was Hutu but mother and wife were Tutsi, has denied exaggerating his role. 
CALLS FOR ARMED STRUGGLE 
A Belgian citizen who resides in the United States, Rusesabagina has called for armed rebellion against Kagame, who came to power in 1994 when he led troops into Rwanda to end the genocide. 
In December 2018, Rusesabagina posted a video on Youtube denouncing Kagame and calling for an armed struggle. 
The video identified him as the president of the Mouvement Rwandais pour le Changement Démocratique and the National Liberation Forces, which have been linked to attacks in Rwanda.
""The time has come for us to use any means possible to bring about change in Rwanda as all political means have been tried and failed,"" he said. ""Rwandan people can no longer stand the cruelty."" 
Kagame's stabilization of Rwanda, economic reforms and anti-corruption drive won international plaudits - but Rusesabagina says Kagame keeps power through muzzling media and suppressing opposition, charges the government denies. 
Human Rights Watch said in 2017 the government routinely tortured detainees - accusations the government denies. A United Nations delegation investigating the accusations was forced to leave Rwanda, citing government interference.

Kagame won nearly 99% of the vote in the last elections; one of his main opponents, Diane Rwigara, was jailed with her mother for more than a year on charges that judges later dismissed.

PARIS (Reuters) - Tens of millions of pupils returned to school in France, Poland and Russia on Tuesday, their rucksacks loaded with exercise books, geometry sets and, for many, face masks to protect them from a resurgent coronavirus pandemic.
Hand cleansing stations, social distancing and staggered play time will become the new normal as countries across Europe seek ways to get children back into the classroom safely and their economies functioning once again.
But they do so at a time when infections rates are spiraling upwards across the continent and there are widespread concerns that the return to schools and offices, the autumn flu season and excess mortality in winter could drive a second wave.
In France, Spain and elsewhere, some parents and teachers' unions have voiced concern at plans for reopening classrooms as the spread of the virus gathers renewed pace. 
""I prefer her to be going to school,"" Laure Gevaert said as she dropped off her daughter Emma at her junior high school in Saint-Leu-d'Esserent, north of Paris. ""It's not easy home-schooling, and I have to work too.""
Even so, the threat of a second wave was alarming, she said.
""If there are cases at the school, that will worry me. I won't send her in."" 
Countries are taking different approaches to minimize contagion in schools. Spain's 17 regions are responsible for their own back-to-school plan, though they must follow national regulations such as mandatory masks for children over six.
At the Immaculate and St. Joseph of the Mountain center, a Catholic school in Ronda, southern Spain, staff were spacing out desks and preparing hand sanitizer posts. 
""We're doing everything we can,"" said the school's director, Mother Marta, dressed in a starched white habit and white mask. 
In Russia, pupils returned as the country's coronavirus case tally exceeded 1 million.
""I'm not afraid of COVID of course, but I follow the restrictions,"" Daniil Ivanenko, a 9th-grade student, told Reuters in western Moscow.
PLAN B?
The French government said the crisis must not put citizens' lives on hold, while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was crucial schools in England re-open this week. Schools in Scotland reopened earlier this month, with face masks mandatory for secondary school students except in classroooms. 
Johnson is under pressure to show he can oversee a full-time return to school after his Conservative government made a hash of how school-leavers would be graded for exams that were canceled during the lockdown. 
But unions have complained of chaos caused by last minute changes and stressed the importance of a 'Plan B' should a second wave hit.
""You don’t need a crystal ball to see that local restrictions will be a feature of the autumn and winter,"" said Paul Whiteman, general secretary of head teachers' union NAHT. 
At the height of coronavirus lockdowns globally in April, some 1.5 billion children were affected by school closures, according to UNESCO. School closures widened the inequality gap, experts have said.
The risk of coronavirus transmission within schools depends on what is happening in the local community as well as the safety measures put in place, according to epidemiologists.
Global data on the spread of the coronavirus pandemic shows that children and young people make up only 1-2% of cases of COVID-19 worldwide. Most reported infections in children are mild or asymptomatic, with few recorded deaths.
""Schools operate in communities, they don't operate in isolation. So the big thing that we look for is what does transmission look like in the community where those schools operate,"" World Health Organization epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said Geneva.
Germany and Sweden may offer some reassurance.
In Germany, where schools have been reopening since early August, the proportion of coronavirus cases among Under 20s has remained stable. In Sweden, keeping schools open through the pandemic did not lead to higher infection rates among students compared with neighboring Finland, where schools temporarily closed.
""We want to see children returning to school and people returning to the workplace, but we want to see it done safely. At the same time, no country can just pretend the pandemic is over,"" WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - It is hard enough developing a vaccine in record time to halt a global pandemic. But what if you need to print the instructions with every dose in Portuguese, Lithuanian and Greek?
Drugmakers are asking the European Union to loosen rules that require medicines sold in the bloc to include full documentation in 24 separate languages, worried that this could slow down the rapid deployment of hundreds of millions of doses.
""We need an early agreement from EU authorities on the language to be used on the packs and labels for COVID-19 vaccines,"" said Michel Stoffel, head of regulatory affairs at Vaccines Europe, which represents big vaccine makers including GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK),  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) and AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN). 
He told Reuters the industry was pushing EU regulators to quickly choose one language for all 27 EU states for labelling, packaging and instructions on possible COVID-19 vaccines.
The EU's executive Commission promised in June it would temporarily soften language requirements for COVID-19 vaccines, but has not yet put forward a proposal. A spokesman said work was underway to be flexible without compromising on safety.
An EU official said Brussels was considering having printed information in a limited set of languages. Other versions would be available online. 
An industry official said even that might be too difficult: labels may not have enough space for more than two versions.
Consumer groups say leaving any languages off of packaging could hurt patients, particularly those less capable of looking up details online.
""The urgency of getting a vaccine should not be an excuse for companies to cut corners on consumer protection,"" said Monique Goyens, the head of BEUC which represents major European consumer organisations.

The EU translates all its rules into all member languages. Commission staff use English, French and German as working languages.

Ebru Timtik died in an Istanbul hospital after a 238-day hunger strike following her conviction last year for membership of a terrorist organization.
She was a member of the Contemporary Lawyers' Association (CHD), a leftist group accused of having close ties to the outlawed Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C), a Marxist organization.
Following her death, the Istanbul Bar Association hung a picture of Timtik outside its headquarters, in a protest dismissed by Erdogan.
""We should be discussing whether methods such as expulsion from the profession should be introduced for lawyers,"" he told judges and prosecutors at a ceremony in Ankara. 
Just as thieves should not be called on to defend burglars, ""a lawyer who defends terrorists should not be a terrorist"", he said. 
The European Union said it was deeply saddened by the death of Timtik, who had been jailed for 13 years. The EU said she was the fourth prisoner to die this year as a result of a hunger strike.
""The tragic outcome of their fight for a fair trial painfully illustrates the urgent need for the Turkish authorities to credibly address the human rights situation in the country,"" it said.
Erdogan defended recent changes to the structure of Turkey's bar associations, many of which have been strongly critical of the president. The changes will dilute their powers by allowing multiple associations, instead of just one, to be formed in each province. 
""It is very painful that the bars, which should be institutions of justice, turned into the backyard of terror organizations,"" Erdogan said, adding that further measures would be taken to reform the bar associations.

Lopez Obrador now holds a 65% approval rate, according to a nationwide survey of 1,000 voters in face-to-face interviews conducted by pollster Parametria from Aug. 26 to 30.
The rate rose from 54% in March, just as the coronavirus crisis took hold in Latin America's second-largest economy. Lopez Obrador will give a state of the nation address on Tuesday, as Mexico stands in fourth-place globally for most lives lost to the pandemic.
Parametria's August poll was its first in-person survey since February, and comes a day after a door-to-door poll from newspaper Reforma showed the president's approval fell to 56% in August from 59% in March.
When asked about the Reforma results at his daily news conference on Monday, Lopez Obrador said he suspected the newspaper had selectively chosen to interview his opponents. His own poll showed his popularity as high as 70%, he said.
According to Parametria, 46% of respondents said Mexico is ""on the right path,"" compared to 43% in a January-February poll.
In a ranking of Lopez Obrador's performance in more than a dozen areas, including education, poverty and jobs, he scored highest in the effort to root out corruption, with 67% of respondents classifying him as ""good"" or ""very good.""
The fight against drug trafficking ranked the lowest, with just 43% of respondents giving him a positive score.
In all the areas he scored notably higher than his two predecessors.

The rallies in London's Parliament Square and in the cities of Cardiff and Manchester come after protests planned for earlier in the year were canceled due to the spread of the coronavirus.
Extinction Rebellion say an emergency response and mass move away from polluting industries and behaviors is needed to avert a looming climate cataclysm.
Lawmakers returned to Westminster on Tuesday after a summer recess, and the activists are lobbying them to support a ""Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill"" and a citizens' assembly to discuss new approaches to tackling climate change.
""The government is failing to do what's necessary to keep people safe. We are here, taking action, because their criminal negligence is putting lives at risk,"" the group said on its website.
""We refuse to be bystanders and wait for this emergency to push beyond the point of no return.""
Last week organizers said that other ""institutions of power"" would be targeted in the coming days, adding that they would encourage protesters to respect social distancing in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Police late on Monday placed restrictions on where protesters could gather and said they must follow the rules or be liable to arrest.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that climate activists should be ""jumping for joy"" at the government's climate record, and on Tuesday said new policy announcements would be made in the autumn.
""From this crisis we will build back better in this country, we will build back faster and we will build back greener,"" Johnson told senior ministers ahead of a cabinet meeting.

""And there will be a lot to more to come about the way in which this government is going to lead a new green industrial revolution for the UK.""

""This is about an exertion of influence by a foreign power in Austria and this will in no way be accepted,"" Karl Nehammer told a news conference on Tuesday. 
There were clear indications of Turkish influence in Austria, said the director general for public safety, Franz Ruf. The new findings came following extensive investigations by Austrian police after violent clashes between Turkish and Kurdish groups in Vienna in June.
One person has fully confessed to having been ""recruited by the Turkish secret service to spy on other Turkish citizens or Austrian citizens with a Turkish migration background to then report them to the Turkish security authorities"", Nehammer said, adding that the judiciary will file charges on suspicion of espionage. He did not give any details about the person. 
Austria has found that more than 30 Austrians were detained in Turkey between 2018 and 2020 after entering the country and has indications that the Turkish secret service tried to recruit them, the interior minister said.
""Turkish espionage has no place in Austria. There is no place for Turkish influence on liberty and fundamental rights in Austria. We will fight against it vehemently,"" Nehammer said, adding that Europol and the Presidency of the European Council had been informed.

""I don't think this kind of behavior will be of any benefit to the U.S."", China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters at a daily briefing on Tuesday.
The U.S. has ""repeatedly abused the concept of national security, misused national power, and oppressed particular Chinese companies,"" she said.
Chinese companies abide by regulations and market principles she added.
The Pentagon on Friday listed 11 companies, including construction giant China Communications Construction Co, China Three Gorges Corporation Limited, Sinochem Group Co Ltd and China Spacesat , as having links with the Chinese military, laying the groundwork for potential sanctions.
Earlier in the year the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) document listed 20 companies operating in the United States that Washington alleges are backed by the Chinese military.
The Pentagon's designations do not trigger penalties, but a 1999 law that mandates the compilation of the list says the president may impose sanctions that could include blocking all property of the listed parties.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates has betrayed the Islamic world and the Palestinians by reaching a deal toward normalising ties with Israel, Iran's top authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday.
""Of course, the UAE's betrayal will not last long, but this stigma will always be remembered. They allowed the Zionist regime to have a foothold in the region and forgot Palestine,"" Khamenei said in a speech. 
""The Emiratis will be disgraced forever for this treachery against the Islamic world, Arab nations and Palestine."" 
When asked about Khamenei’s statement on the UAE-Israel deal, UAE Foreign Ministry official Jamal Al-Musharakh told reporters in Abu Dhabi: ""The path to peace and prosperity is not paved with incitement and hate speech."" 
Khamenei made his comments as a delegation of senior Israeli and U.S. officials, including White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law, concluded a historic trip to Abu Dhabi to finalise the pact. [L8N2FX0SS]
""The UAE along with Israelis and evil Americans like the Jewish member of Trump's family are working together against the interests of the Islamic world,"" Khamenei said, referring to Kushner.
""I hope Emiratis wake up and compensate for what they did.""
The delegation arrived in Abu Dhabi on an El Al flight on Monday, the first direct commercial passenger flight between the UAE and Israel. 
The deal, the first accommodation between an Arab country and Israel in more than 20 years, was forged in part as a result of shared fear of Iran. It has dismayed Palestinian leaders, however, who believe it further erodes their struggle for an independent state.
The UAE has said that the agreement was a bold but necessary step and suggested it could help address the region's polarisation.

The Trump administration has tried to coax other Sunni Muslim Arab countries concerned about mainly Shi'ite Iran to engage with Israel.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Tuesday urged nations to fight global warming according to the 2015 Paris climate accord, weighing in on issue that figures in the U.S. presidential race.
Modern society had pushed the planet beyond its limits and the time to fix a climate emergency was running out, he said.
""Our constant demand for growth and an endless cycle of production and consumption are exhausting the natural world,"" Francis said. ""Forests are leached, topsoil erodes, fields fail, deserts advance, seas acidify and storms intensify. Creation is groaning!""
He made his call in a message on the day Christian Churches mark the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation.
""We need to do everything in our capacity to limit global average temperature rise under the threshold of 1.5°C enshrined in the Paris Climate Agreement, for going beyond that will prove catastrophic, especially for poor communities around the world,"" he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has put in motion a process to remove the United States, the world's No. 2 emitter of greenhouse gases behind China, from the agreement that brought countries together to mitigate global warming, saying it was too costly.
His challenger for the presidency, Democratic candidate Joe Biden, has said he will return the United States to a leadership role on climate change, assertively re-entering the nation in future climate negotiations to advance the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.

Pope Francis said biodiversity loss, climate disasters, and the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the poor and vulnerable were all a ""wakeup call in the face of our rampant greed and consumption"".

The appointment of 41-year old Case puts him in a senior advisory position in government, as well as overseeing the work of more than 400,000 state employees and making sure they implement Johnson's policy decisions.
The job of Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Civil Service is a non-political role, meaning Case is expected to be impartial and he would remain in that position even after any change of government.
Nevertheless, the role is at the heart of decision-making and will put Case in the room with Johnson and other ministers as the government plans the nation's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and future outside the European Union. 
""His years of experience at the heart of government and working for The Royal Household make him ideally suited for this crucial role,"" Johnson said.
Case replaces Mark Sedwill, seen as a highly influential voice during the Brexit process, who warned about the risks of leaving the EU without a deal. 
Case worked as Prince William's closest aide from July 2018 before returning to work in the civil service earlier this year to help the government's coronavirus response.
Before that he held several senior civil service positions, and was closely involved in work at the center of the Brexit process on how Northern Ireland would function outside the EU. 
He also worked at the GCHQ spying agency as director of strategy.
Johnson's top political aide Dominic Cummings has long advocated the need to reform the civil service, stating in a January blog post that there were ""profound problems at the core of how the British state makes decisions.""

1513,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Back to school: how European classrooms are coping with COVID,"(Reuters) - Schools across Europe are reopening as summer break ends and governments insist that students return to the classroom after months of online learning due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Countries are taking different approaches to minimise contagion in schools, as outlined below.
BRITAIN
Primary schools reopened in England on June 1, starting with some year groups. Secondary school students aged 15 to 18 returned on June 15. All years are back full time for the new school year this week. Scotland's schools reopened on Aug. 11.
A recent survey of mostly English schools shows 96% of schools are splitting classes into small groups or 'bubbles', with each group keeping a safe distance from the other groups to minimise contagion risk. The vast majority plan to change break times and stagger start times, according to the survey by the National Association for Head Teachers.
Rules on face masks and other protective equipment differ: secondary students in England need only wear face masks in communal spaces if lockdowns are imposed in their areas. In Scotland, they will be compulsory when moving about school.
FRANCE
Schools reopen on Sept. 1
Students aged over 11 years must wear face masks at all times, including indoors. Schools must limit the mixing of class groups, and ventilate and disinfect classrooms.
School attendance is mandatory, though schools can adapt to a surge in local coronavirus infections by, for example, limiting attendance for a few days or weeks. In the event of a major regional outbreak, schools can close temporarily.
In kindergarten, children within the same class group need not observe social distancing. Primary schools can split up classes into groups of 8 to 15 pupils who alternate between half-days in class and learning from home. At secondary schools, all students attend school at least a few days a week.
GERMANY
Children have been returning to school full time since early August. In most states, children and teachers have to wear masks indoors except when at their desks. North Rhine Westphalia dropped a rule that older students wear masks in lessons after criticism from parents and doctors.
Classes or year groups must keep to different parts of the school during breaks. Doors and windows are kept open as much as possible. Most teachers have returned to school, though campaigners are pushing for more protection for them. Some online lessons continue in special circumstances.
GREECE
Schools are expected to reopen on Sept. 7 but a delay may be deemed necessary.
Teachers and students will be required to wear masks in class and other indoor spaces, with each being given one fabric mask. Class sizes will be limited to 17 students.
ITALY
Schools in most regions are set to reopen on Sept. 14. Measures to minimise contagion are still being finalised. 
To aid social distancing, entry times will be slightly staggered and new, single desks will be introduced in the coming weeks. Mask wearing will be obligatory for those arriving and leaving school, but they can be removed during lessons if there is a safe distance between desks.
Some secondary schools with larger class sizes say they will use a mix of distance learning and on-site teaching to prevent overcrowding. The government has agreed to provide more funds to increase public transport to allow for safe travel to schools.
If a student or teacher is infected, it will be up to head teachers and health authorities to decide whether to shut down whole schools, single classes or impose quarantine on those directly involved.
THE NETHERLANDS
Dutch elementary and high schools began reopening in stages in August, as normal.
Primary and high school classes are conducted face-to-face. Neither students nor teachers are required to wear face masks. Some teachers have been reluctant to return to work and a number of schools introduced their own mask requirements.
If a student is infected, everyone in his or her household must stay home for 10 days. Children aged above six years who show symptoms must stay home and get tested; younger pupils may attend school and day-care even with mild cold symptoms, but must stay home if they have a fever.
NORWAY
Schools reopened gradually from April 27.
Children are not required to wear face masks and school hours remain largely unchanged.
Online learning is no longer an option. Classmates stick together and do not mix at school with members of other cohorts. During breaks, each class is assigned a different area of the playground. Break times are also staggered. Children with symptoms must stay home and be tested for COVID infection. In kindergartens, children can attend even if they have a sniffle but must stay home if symptoms are more serious.
POLAND
Schools reopen Sept. 1
Face masks are not compulsory in class. Headmasters decide on use of masks in common areas and on whether to stagger school hours. Requests by some schools and municipalities to delay school reopenings have been declined. Primary and high schools in cities such as Warsaw are crowded and some educators say it will be impossible to respect social distancing rules even with staggered hours. Families who decline to send their children to school may face a fine of up to 10,000 zlotys ($2,710). 
RUSSIA
Schools reopen on Sept. 1.
Classroom times and breaks will be staggered to prevent overcrowding in common areas. Temperature checks are carried out at school. Students with flu-like symptoms are isolated. Children are advised to wear masks but it is not compulsory. Staff are expected to wear masks all the times unless explaining new material or standing at a safe distance from students.
Online education will not be offered as an alternative.
SPAIN
    Primary and secondary schools start the academic year across the regions in the first three weeks of September.
School attendance is mandatory, as are face masks in class for children aged six and over. Students must wash their hands at least five times a day. Social distancing must be observed, except among members of a ""bubble"", a small group of children who must distance from members of other bubbles. Temperature checks are carried out each morning, at school or at home.
SWEDEN
Swedish schools stayed open throughout the pandemic and welcomed students back in mid-August after the summer break. Local authorities decide how to handle possible outbreaks, including the option of closing individual schools.
Each school is responsible for following guidelines on social distancing and hygiene. Masks are not mandatory. 
    Some municipalities changed school schedules to avoid crowding on public transport. Keeping schools open in spring did not lead to higher infection rates among students compared with neighbouring Finland where schools temporarily closed, according to a joint report by the two countries' public health agencies.

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 06:01AM ET</span>",Canberra says not told why Australian journalist detained in China,"By Kirsty Needham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia does not know why Chinese authorities have detained Australian citizen and television anchor Cheng Lei, Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said on Tuesday, adding to the mystery why the journalist has been taken into custody.
The Australian government confirmed on Monday evening that Cheng, a high-profile business anchor on Chinese state television, was detained two weeks ago.
""Cheng Lei is an Australian, a journalist who has been working in China for some period of time,"" Birmingham told ABC radio, adding authorities in Canberra did not know why she was detained.
""I feel for her family very much at this point in time, and it's why we will do what we can to assist her, as we would and have any Australian in these sorts of circumstances,"" he added.
Cheng hosted a business show on the English channel of China's largest state media broadcaster, CCTV, and was a high-profile anchor on its English-language channel CGTN. But videos of her have been removed from Chinese state media websites, Reuters found. 
Friends of Cheng told Reuters they noticed the videos were taken down two weeks ago, about the time of her detention, and they became concerned when they were unable to contact her. They also said they did not know why she was detained.
Cheng regularly hosted Australian business forums and events in Beijing. She was well known in the Australian business community in China.
Authorities in China have not released information on her detention. China's foreign ministry declined to comment on the specifics of Cheng's case at a regular briefing on Tuesday, but said China will act in accordance with law. 
""We value China-Australia relations, but at the same time, the development of bilateral relations requires the joint efforts of both sides,"" said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying in response to a question about whether the case was linked to Cheng's nationality and recent issues in the Sino-Australian relationship.
'DEGREE OF SCEPTICISM'
The Australian embassy was given consular access to Cheng via video link on Aug. 27, Birmingham said. Cheng has two children, both in Australia.
Australia's former ambassador to China, Geoff Raby, a business consultant, said Cheng was a longtime friend and experienced journalist who had interviewed him many times for her business programme.
Business reporting is not usually seen as politically sensitive in China, he said, adding that he was astonished she had been detained.
""She held a degree of scepticism towards some Chinese media, but she was equally strong in arguing China's case if foreign reporting mischaracterized China or was not based on facts,"" Raby told Reuters.
A statement released by Cheng's family on Monday night said they are in close contact with Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on her case and ""look forward to a satisfactory and timely conclusion to the matter.""
Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne told local radio on Tuesday afternoon the Australian government has sought information on why Cheng was detained.
""The process within the Chinese system does not require the laying of charges at this point, but we'll continue to seek information about that,"" Payne said.
The Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement that Chinese authorities should disclose their reasons for holding Cheng or release her.
Steven Butler, CPJ's Asia programme coordinator, said, ""China – the world's number one jailer of journalists – must make clear whether her detention has anything to do with her media work.""
Tensions between Australia and China have been high this year, after Australia in April called for an international investigation into the source of the coronavirus pandemic.
Beijing has said it was angered by the move, and has since blocked Australian beef imports, placed dumping tariffs on Australian barley, and launched an anti-dumping investigation into Australian wine.
Birmingham told television network Nine that many of the trade measures lacked substance.

""I've been very concerned at the number of different trade issues that have come our way this year, that I think changes the risk profile for Australian businesses in engaging with China,"" he said.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Two crew members from a tugboat involved in cleaning up an oil spill off Mauritius were killed late on Monday when their vessel collided with a barge in bad weather, a local lawmaker said.
Four other members of the crew were rescued by helicopter and two were still missing, Mahend Gungerpersad, a member of parliament for the opposition Labour Party, told Reuters on Tuesday.
""This incident is going to add to the prevailing anger,"" he said, referring to weekend protests over the handling of the operation to contain the oil spill and the deaths of dozens of dolphins in the area.
""We had the oil spill, then we had the deaths of the dolphins and now two people who have been killed.""
The MV Wakashio, a Japanese bulk carrier, struck a coral reef off the Indian Ocean island nation's coast in July, spilling thousands of tonnes of crude oil into the sea and choking marine life in a pristine lagoon.
According to Gungerpersad, the tugboat and barge sent out a distress signal at between 7.30 and 8.00 p.m. on Monday. The tugboat capsized after the collision. Both ships were moving parts salvaged from the site of the oil spill into the port.
Mauritians have been angered by what Gungerpersad called ""mismanagement"" and ""incompetence"" by the government in its handling of the crisis.
Apart from dolphin deaths, the spill has threatened decades of work to conserve local sea birds and plant species in a nearby protected reserve.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's chief government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, moved a step closer to becoming the next premier when the ruling party decided on Tuesday on a slimmed-down leadership vote that favours the long-time lieutenant of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Suga has also won the backing of the largest faction of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), media reported, making him a strong front-runner to replace Abe, who announced on Friday he was stepping down for health reasons.
While Suga has not announced his candidacy for party head, he has indicated privately that he intends to run, a source told Reuters. Media reported he would formally announce his intention to run on Wednesday. 
The party's leader will almost certainly become prime minister because of its majority in the lower house of parliament. 
Suga, 71, would be widely expected to stay the policy course set out by Abe, including the ""Abenomics"" strategy aimed at reviving the economy and keeping it afloat amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.
A self-made politician, Suga was chosen by Abe in 2012 for the pivotal role of chief cabinet secretary, acting as top government spokesman, coordinating policies and riding herd on bureaucrats.
Suga's most likely rivals for the top spot will be former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba and ex-foreign minister Fumio Kishida. 
Both Kishida and Ishiba announced their candidacies on Tuesday. But Defence Minister Taro Kono, who had been expected to run, had decided not to, Kyodo news reported.
The LDP general council's decision to keep rank-and-file party members out of the leadership vote gives Suga, with his powerful backers, a leg-up in the race. Ishiba, who is more popular with voters, as well as hundreds of other party members, had opposed the format.
Announcing his candidacy, Ishiba said it was ""very regrettable"" that all LDP members would not be able to vote for their leader. He has said the decision would be bad for both democracy and the party.
Kishida, who was long seen as Abe's preferred successor but has been scoring low in voter polls, said the slimmed-down leadership race was in line with party rules and Japan must continue with fiscal stimulus.
Kishida emphasised his experience in economics and foreign policy, telling a news conference he would do his ""utmost for the nation and the people"".
AVOIDING A VACUUM
LDP Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai, whose faction is backing Suga, said the simplified vote, by party MPs from both chambers of parliament and heads of local chapters, would be taken in the interest of speed.
LDP General Council chief, Shunichi Suzuki, said the decision to have a simplified vote was unanimous, with some worrying that a prolonged process would place a burden on Abe's health.
On Monday, younger LDP legislators met Nikai to present a demand from more than 140 MPs and about 400 local party lawmakers for a full-scale vote. Several chapters including Osaka had also demanded the same.
The LDP is expected to hold the vote on Sept. 14, with an announcement on the date due on Wednesday. Financial markets also favour and appear to have factored in a win by Suga.
""He is considered to be a very effective policy leader within the party and bureaucracy ... and was key to Abe's successful tenure,"" said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management.
""Suga's experience with the virus situation, including his appropriate push-back on complete shutdowns, is key, as this is Japan's greatest concern right now,"" he said.

Another possible contender is Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi who said on Tuesday he had not decided whether to run, while former cabinet minister Seiko Noda said she would not run.

Kennedy's defiance of Communism in Berlin in 1963, further riling Beijing.
China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, has threatened to make Czech Senate speaker Milos Vystrcil pay a ""heavy price"" for visiting the island. The Czech Republic, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
Addressing Taiwan's parliament, Vystrcil, who is leading a delegation of about 90 politicians and business executives, said Kennedy's declaration he was a Berliner was an important message for freedom and against Communism.
""Please let me also express in person my support to Taiwan and the ultimate value of freedom and conclude today's speech ... with perhaps a more humble, but equally strong statement: 'I am a Taiwanese',"" Vystrcil said, receiving a standing ovation.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Vystrcil was openly supporting separatism and interfering in China's internal affairs.
""China strongly condemns this,"" Hua told reporters.
Kennedy's ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" speech in 1963, telling the frightened people of West Berlin who were surrounded on all sides by Communist East Berlin that he was also a Berliner, is an address often called Kennedy's best.
Vystrcil has said his Taiwan visit underscores the ""values-based"" foreign policy put in place by late President Vaclav Havel, an anti-communist dissident and personal friend of the exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama.
While the Czech government has not supported his visit, it has been upset by China's strong condemnation and has summoned the Chinese ambassador. Beijing on Monday also summoned the Czech ambassador for a telling-off.

Czech President Milos Zeman has sought closer business and political ties with China since taking office in 2013, but his efforts have been hit by failed investment plans and Czech wavering about allowing China's Huawei Technologies to play a role in developing next-generation telecoms networks.

A day earlier, Greece's finance minister said the country is ready to spend part of its cash reserves on arms purchases and other means which will help increase its ""deterrence force"", after years of belt-tightening in defence spending. 
""We are in talks with France, and not only with France, in order to increase our country's defence potential,"" a government official told Reuters. ""Within this framework, there is a discussion which includes the purchase of aircraft."" 
The official added that no final decisions had been made. Greek media reported on Monday that Athens had agreed to acquire 18 Dassault-made Rafale fighter jets from France. 
""There is no agreement as written in several media. However, there are discussions on a number of subjects,"" a French government source said, without providing further detail. 
Greece has been at odds with neighbouring Turkey over a range of issues including overlapping claims for hydrocarbon resources in the region, based on conflicting claims over the extent of their continental shelves. 
Tensions escalated last month after Ankara dispatched the Oruc Reis seismic survey vessel in a disputed area following a pact between Athens and Cairo ratifying maritime boundaries.
France and Germany have tried to mediate to defuse the tension, while Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis held two calls with United States President Donald Trump last week. 
On Monday night, Turkey extended the Oruc Reis vessel's work until Sept. 12. The Turkish advisory came after the EU called for dialogue with Ankara.

Greece's foreign ministry called the advisory illegal and urged Turkey ""to desist from its daily rants and to work for security and stability in the region.""

Local television stations reported that a suicide bomber on a motorbike had detonated a device at a roundabout where the main highway from the west enters the city, but there was no immediate official confirmation. 
If confirmed as an attack, it would be the first for more than a year. 
""I was driving on the motorway early morning at about 7.30 and I heard a massive explosion... Most of the other vehicles turned back after we saw black smoke in the sky,"" said a witness who asked not to be named. 
Libya has been convulsed by political chaos and warfare for much of the period since the 2011 revolution that ousted Muammar Gaddafi.
The country is split between the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) and the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) loyal to Khalifa Haftar in Benghazi. 
In June, the GNA ended a 14-month LNA assault on the capital and forced it to retreat, bringing a close to months of heavy bombardment.

He named the suspect as Mahmut Ozden and said the operation was continuing, with Islamic State suspects linked to him currently under interrogation. It was not clear where or when he was detained.
Turkish police sporadically carry out raids targeting Islamic State. On July 19 they detained 27 people in Istanbul linked to the group who were suspected of preparing an attack.
Islamic State has conducted numerous attacks across Turkey, including on a nightclub in Istanbul on Jan. 1, 2017 in which 39 people were killed, and a bombing in the city's historic heart that killed 12 in 2016.

The unrest began a day earlier at Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre in the city of Brisbane, four days after local media said the prison went into lockdown due to two staff testing positive to COVID-19.
A shortage of replacement staff for those stood down to get tested for the virus had resulted in problems delivering basic services like meals and medication, the authorities said.
""There's been some unrest (including) small amounts of fire that were lit, that were localised and easily extinguished,"" Corrections Commissioner Peter Martin told reporters.
""In some cases, prisoners flooded their cells with water (and) there was the damage of some glass and also some CCTV.""
Some 400 of the prison's 530 staff had been stood down to get tested, along with 170 prisoners, and replacement staff had faced challenges since ""every prisoner is different, the technology is different and the processes are different"", Martin said.
Australia has so far avoided the high COVID-19 casualty numbers of other countries, with a total 657 deaths linked to the illness, after closures of national and internal borders put curbs on movement. The country has used location-specific lockdowns to control outbreaks.
Since the prison guards tested positive last week, Australia's third-most populous state, Queensland, has put about 7,000 inmates into lockdown, prompting concerns from advocates about limited access to lawyers and essential support.

Jutatip Sirikhan, 21, the president of the Student Union of Thailand, was arrested by a plain-cloth police officer while she was in a taxi traveling to a university in Bangkok, a video shot by Jutatip and posted on her personal Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page showed.
The officer identified himself as a member of the Bangkok Metropolitan Police in the video before citing a court's arrest warrant.
""We are acting on an arrest warrant for the July 18 protest,"" a police officer at Samranrat police station in Bangkok said by telephone.
Jutatip will be charged with breaching internal security and coronavirus regulations banning public gathering among other charges, the officer said.
Student groups have rallied almost daily across the country since July 18, calling for a new constitution and an end to military influence over Thai politics after a disputed election last year kept former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha as Prime Minister five years after he first took power in a 2014 military coup.
Some protesters have also called for reform on the monarchy, until recently a taboo subject in Thailand, which has strict punishments for perceived royal insults.
Police have arrested more than a dozen people, including student leaders, rappers and activists for holding protests since July.

Those arrested so far have all been released on bail.

Last week Hungary said it would close its borders to foreigners from Tuesday to curb a rise in coronavirus cases. Returning Hungarian citizens can leave a 14-day quarantine only if they provide two negative COVID tests.
However, after talks with Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis on Monday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban agreed to let Czech visitors who have already booked holidays in Hungary for September enter the country, the Foreign Ministry said.
The easing was subsequently extended to Poland and Slovakia, the ministry said in a statement. Visitors coming to Hungary have to produce a negative COVID test not older than five days, which Budapest says represents sufficient safety guarantees.
As of Monday, Hungary had reported 6,139 coronavirus cases with 615 deaths. The number of new cases has surged in recent days, just as Hungary prepared to start the school year.
Orban, a nationalist who has been in power since 2010, faces one of the biggest challenges of his rule as the Hungarian economy plunged by an annual 13.6% in the second quarter. Hungary eased lockdown measures in May.

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) said on Tuesday that it was preparing for Myanmar's general election in November by improving the detection and removal of hate speech and content that incites violence and preventing the spread of misinformation.
The company said in a blog that between now and Nov. 22, it would remove ""verifiable misinformation and unverifiable rumours"" that are assessed as having the potential to suppress the vote or damage the ""integrity"" of the electoral process.
""For example, we would remove posts falsely claiming a candidate is a Bengali, not a Myanmar citizen, and thus ineligible,"" Facebook said.
The platform came under fire in Myanmar after a military-led crackdown in 2017 that forced more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee the country. U.N. investigators said Facebook played a key role in spreading hate speech that fuelled the violence.
The company has long said it works to stop hate speech.
Facebook said it was working with two partners in Myanmar to verify the official Facebook pages of political parties. It now has three fact-checking partners in Myanmar: BOOM, AFP Fact Check and Fact Crescendo.
The company took action against 280,000 pieces of content in Myanmar for violating its standards prohibiting hate speech in the second quarter of this year, up from 51,000 such pieces that it took action against in the first quarter.
It also said it introduced a new feature that limits the number of times a message can be forwarded to five.
The feature is now available in Myanmar and, over the course of the next few weeks, would be made available to Messenger users worldwide, the company added in the blog.
The 2020 elections in Myanmar, scheduled for Nov. 8, will be its second democratic election since the end of almost half a century of strict military rule. 
The first, in 2016, brought long-time pro-democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) to power.

Facebook and other social media platforms have faced criticism worldwide in recent years from activists, regulators and governments for the spread of misinformation, including during elections.

1528,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 09:36PM ET</span>","In Indonesia, coronavirus floods Cisadane River with extra hazard: medical waste","By Yuddy Cahya Budiman and Tommy Ardiansyah
TANGERANG, Indonesia (Reuters) - For the residents along Indonesia's Cisadane River, the coronavirus has brought not just deadly disease, but also a deluge of medical waste: a constant stream of syringes, face masks and hazmat suits floating by.
The double threat for those who depend on the 138-kilometre-long river to bathe and wash their clothes comes as Indonesia has struggled to contain COVID-19, now with the highest death toll in Southeast Asia, and in the past week almost 3,000 new infections a day.
As the virus has spread, medical waste had been piling up at Tangerang's Cipeucang landfill. Then in May its walls collapsed, sending tons of garbage straight into the Cisadane's khaki green waters.
""I still worry to be honest, but I have to wash here,"" local resident Eka Purwanti, 36, told Reuters, as she did her laundry in the river, and children played on the riverbank, ""I hope nothing will happen, although I know it's a deadly disease.""
Like countries around the world, Indonesia has seen the pandemic bring a huge increase in medical waste, an issue that has raised concern in places from Spain to Thailand and India.
In the months since the landfill collapsed, Ade Yunus, founder of the Cisadane River Rubbish Bank, has been working to cleaning up the waterway. 
""The first time we found medical waste was after the landslide,"" said Yunus, bending down to pick up a syringe and deposit it in a safe box. ""In the beginning, we found around 50-60 items every day.""
Indonesia's health ministry acknowledged the problem - saying 1,480 tons of COVID-19 medical waste was produced across the country from March through June - and admitted the country lacked treatment facilities, but was working on solutions.
""A new regulation has just passed that included guidelines around medical waste treatment in every health facility,"" said ministry official, Imran Agus Nurali. 
Most health facilities in Indonesia, including hospitals, currently rely on third parties to incinerate their waste.
The deluge has raised fears among public health experts that the medical waste could spread the disease, with those in riverside communities at high risk. 
""If this medical waste spreads in the residential area near the river then it could potentially pollute the water that is used by people there,"" said Mahesa Paranadipa Maikel, an epidemiologist from the Indonesian Law Health Society, ""It could potentially result in the transmission of COVID-19.""
By the river, it's a risk residents recognise.

""I worry if the children could get infected with COVID-19 when they swim here,"" said Cisadane local Astri Dewiyani. ""That's why I always forbid my kids to swim at the river.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Liberty University, one of the world's largest Christian learning institutions, said on Monday it will launch a wide-ranging investigation into the tenure of Jerry Falwell Jr, who stepped down as president last week amid a series of personal scandals.
In a statement, the school said it would examine ""all facets"" of the school's operations under Falwell, including financial and real estate matters. Falwell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Falwell stepped down last Tuesday after a Reuters report disclosed that a business associate of Falwell alleged he’d had a years-long affair with Falwell and his wife, Becki. His departure as chief of Liberty marked a dramatic fall for one of the leading power brokers in America's evangelical Christian movement. Falwell's backing of Donald Trump in 2016 helped propel the twice-divorced New Yorker to the U.S. presidency. 

The university, based in Lynchburg, Virginia, said a forensics firm, which it did not name, would lead the inquiry. Falwell has said in interviews that he will receive over $10 million as part of his severance package.

According to CNN Brasil, Bolsonaro had an ultrasound test that showed the kidney stone to be the size of a bean and can be easily removed with a catheter.
Bolsonaro, aged 65, tested positive for COVID-19 in July and spent two weeks in isolation. After he was cured, he resumed an active routine of public events and trips around Brazil.

His health has been a matter of public concern since he was stabbed during the 2018 election campaign and needed emergency surgery for a knife wound in the abdomen that caused him serious loss of blood.

1532,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 08:30PM ET</span>","U.S. increases support for Taiwan, says to counter rising China pressure","By David Brunnstrom and Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Monday it was establishing a new bilateral economic dialogue with Taiwan, an initiative it said was aimed at strengthening ties with Taipei and supporting it in the face of increasing pressure from Beijing.
Washington also said it had declassified six Reagan-era security assurances given to Taiwan, a move analysts said appeared intended to show further support for Taipei.
The announcements come at a time of increasing Chinese threats towards Taiwan, and when relations between Washington and Beijing have sunk to their lowest level in decades. U.S. President Donald Trump is campaigning for re-election in November with a tough approach to China among his key foreign policy platforms.
The State Department's top diplomat for East Asia, David Stilwell, told a virtual forum hosted by the conservative Heritage Foundation the latest U.S. moves were not a policy shift, but part of a set of ""significant adjustments"" within Washington's longstanding ""one-China"" policy.
Washington felt compelled to make these given the ""increasing threat posed by Beijing to peace and stability"" in a vitally important region and Beijing's attempts to isolate Taiwan diplomatically while subjecting it to military threats.
""We will continue to help Taipei resist the Chinese Communist Party’s campaign to pressure, intimidate, and marginalize Taiwan,"" Stilwell said. 
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry expressed thanks for the show of support at a time when it said China was using military intimidation to damage peace and stability near Taiwan, and said it would continue to strengthen its defence capabilities.
The United States, like most countries, has official relations with Beijing, but not Taiwan, which is claimed by Beijing as Chinese territory. However, Washington is bound by law to help Taiwan defend itself and is its main arms supplier.
Daniel Russel, a predecessor of Stilwell until early in the Trump administration, said the ""Six Assurances"" made to Taipei by the administration of former President Ronald Reagan had been a ""loosely-kept secret"" at best.
He said the decision to publish them looked like a compromise response to pressure from administration hawks to abandon ""strategic ambiguity"" — a long-standing policy of withholding a clear-cut U.S. commitment to defend Taiwan while still showing sufficient support to deter any Chinese military adventurism.
Among the assurances made in 1982, but never formally made public, are statements that the United States has not set a date for ending arms sales to Taiwan, nor agreed to prior consultation with Beijing on such sales, or to revise the Taiwan Relations Act that underpins U.S. policy towards the island.
The assurances, Stilwell said, ""endure today.""
Douglas Paal, a former U.S. representative to Taiwan, said the move appeared largely for show. 
""My guess at this time is that Stilwell and the administration want to look tough ... So they are walking close to China's red lines, but remain unwilling to cross them.""
Stilwell said the economic dialogue would ""explore the full spectrum of our economic relationship - semiconductors, healthcare, energy, and beyond, with technology at the core.""
""While they may be interrelated, our relationship with Taiwan is not a subset of our bilateral relationship with the PRC,"" he said, referring to mainland China.
Monday's announcements come several months after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330), the world's biggest contract chipmaker, announced plans to build a $12 billion factory in Arizona as the Trump administration stepped up efforts to cut back supply chains dependency on China.
Taiwan has been keen to negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States, but a large U.S. trade deficit, which Trump has been determined to reduce along with those of other trading partners, including China, has been an obstacle to this.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Senior U.S. and Israeli officials landed in the United Arab Emirates on Monday on a historic trip to finalise a pact marking open relations between Israel and the Gulf state, and they told Palestinians it was now time for them to negotiate peace.
White House senior adviser Jared Kushner also said on arrival that Washington could help maintain Israel's military edge while advancing its ties to the UAE, the Arab world's second largest economy and a regional power.
Announced on Aug. 13, the normalisation deal is the first such accommodation between an Arab country and Israel in more than 20 years and was forged largely through shared fears of Iran.
Palestinians were dismayed by the UAE's move, seeing it as a betrayal that would weaken a long-standing pan-Arab position which calls for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory and acceptance of Palestinian statehood in return for normal relations with Arab countries. [L8N2FV09W]
Kushner said Palestinians should not be ""stuck in the past"".
""They have to come to the table. Peace will be ready for them, an opportunity will be ready for them as soon as they are ready to embrace it,"" said Kushner, part of a U.S. delegation that accompanied Israeli officials on the first official Israeli flight from Tel Aviv to the UAE.
In a joint statement, the UAE, Israel and the United States urged Palestinian leaders to re-engage with their Israeli counterparts.
The Abu Dhabi crown prince earlier said that the UAE was committed to the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, state news agency WAM reported.
""Peace is a strategic choice, but not at the expense of the Palestinian cause,"" WAM cited him as saying. [L8N2FX5A7]
Kushner and U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien headed the U.S. delegation on the two-day visit. The Israeli team was led by O'Brien's counterpart, Meir Ben-Shabbat. 
Israel and the United Arab Emirates will discuss economic, scientific, trade and cultural cooperation on the visit. Direct flights between the two countries will also be on the agenda, an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman told al Arabiya television after landing in Abu Dhabi.
""That's what peace for peace looks like,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted, describing a deal for formal ties with an Arab state that does not entail handover of land that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. 
At a news conference in Jerusalem late on Monday, Netanyahu said: ""It will be a warm peace because it will be based on cooperation in the realm of economics, with an entrepreneurial economy like ours, with vast economic capabilities, with big money looking for investment channels.""
ARABIC GREETING
Even before landing, the delegates made aviation history when the Israeli commercial airliner flew over Saudi territory on the direct flight from Tel Aviv to the UAE capital.
Israeli officials hope the trip will produce a date for a signing ceremony in Washington, perhaps as early as September, between Netanyahu and Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan.
That could give U.S. President Donald Trump a foreign policy boost ahead of his re-election bid in November. 
The Trump administration has tried to coax other Sunni Arab countries concerned about Iran to engage with Israel. The most powerful of those, Saudi Arabia, while opening its airspace to the El Al flight, has signalled it is not ready.
On board the packed airliner, passengers were welcomed in Arabic as well as English and Hebrew.
""Wishing us all salaam, peace and shalom, have a safe flight,"" the pilot, Captain Tal Becker, said on the intercom, using all three languages to also announce the flight number and destination.
Like all El Al 737s, the aircraft was equipped with an anti-missile system, an Israeli spokesman said, and carried security agents of the U.S. Secret Service and the Israeli Shin Bet.
Palestinian leaders expressed anger at a deal which they believe further erodes their struggle for an independent state.
""Peace is not an empty word used to normalize crimes and oppression. Peace is the outcome of justice,"" politician Saeb Erekat said in a tweet.
""Peace is not made by denying Palestine’s right to exist and imposing an apartheid regime. Apartheid is what Netanyahu means by peace for peace."" 
The Islamist Hamas group, which controls the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, also condemned the UAE.
The flight represents a ""stab in the back of the Palestinian people, a prolonging of the occupation, and a betrayal of the resistance of the (Palestinian) people,"" Hamas said in a statement. 
Hours before the plane landed, in apparently unrelated incidents that authorities attributed to gas malfunctions, three people were killed and several others were injured in two separate explosions in Abu Dhabi and UAE tourism hub Dubai, police and local media said.
The Abu Dhabi government media office said two people were killed in the blast in the capital, which the National daily reported hit KFC and Hardee's restaurants, located on a main road leading to the airport.

In the second incident, one person was killed when a gas cylinder exploded in a Dubai restaurant, local media reported.

The City of London Corporation, which runs the area that is home to some of the world's biggest banks, has launched a three-month consultation.
The memorials could be re-sited, reinterpreted or retained depending on the responses collected, Andrien Meyers, co-chair of the City's Tackling Racism Taskforce, said. Street and building names could also be changed.
""We know that historical symbols continue to have an impact today and we want to understand how people feel about this aspect of our cultural history,"" Meyers said. 
Statues and memorials with links to slavery and racism have been targeted globally, with some toppled by protesters and others removed by civic authorities or property owners.
Black Lives Matter protests have forced UK authorities and companies to begin reckoning with racism and the country's past links to slavery, which brought vast wealth in the 17th and 18th centuries.
The Lloyd's of London insurance market and Bank of England are among City organisations that have apologised for past links to slavery.
One City statue targeted for removal by a petition in June is a huge monument to William Beckford, twice Lord Mayor of London in the 1760s and the largest slave owner of his time.
His statue stands in the Guildhall, the ornate seat of the City of London Corporation. The government rejected the petition on the grounds it was a matter for the local authority.

In June, a statue of Robert Milligan, an 18th century slave trader, was removed from outside a museum in the Docklands area of the capital.

Indian forces foiled an attempt by Chinese troops to occupy a hill on the Asian giants’ disputed border in the western Himalayas, officials in New Delhi said on Monday. 
On the same day, China's military spokesman demanded India withdraw troops that Beijing said had illegally crossed their shared border. China's foreign ministry said Chinese border troops had not crossed the line of actual control.
""India ... said it preempted Chinese military activity,"" the Global Times said in an editorial. ""The word 'preempt' shows it was the Indian troops that first took destructive actions, and the Indian troops initiated the standoff this time.""
It added that India faced a ""powerful China"" and that New Delhi should not have any ""illusions"" of support from Washington over the issue. 
""But if India wants to engage in competition, China has more tools and capability than India. If India would like a military showdown, the PLA (People's Liberation Army) is bound to make the Indian army suffer much more severe losses than it did in 1962.""
The Global Times is published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party.
Tensions between the two armies in the freezing snow deserts of the Ladakh region have been running high for months.
In June, 20 Indian soldiers were killed in hand-to-hand fighting with Chinese troops in the nearby Galwan valley, the neighbours’ most serious military clash in more than half a century. 
Both sides had agreed to pull back after that clash, but the Indian Army accused Chinese forces of violating that accord over the weekend.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had promised to get schools back up and running before the summer break, but was forced to shelve those plans, contributing to criticism over how his government has handled education during the crisis.
The Department for Education said that a ""system of controls"" would be in place to keep pupils and teachers safe, with social distancing maintained whenever possible.
""I do not underestimate how challenging the last few months have been but I do know how important it is for children to be back in school, not only for their education but for their development and wellbeing too,"" said education minister Gavin Williamson, who has also come under pressure. 
Schools shut their doors in March, except for the children of key workers, and reopened in June for only a small number of pupils. A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in August suggested school closures widened educational inequalities between poorer and richer students. 
Concerns over an educational divide were compounded in August, when the government bowed to pressure from angry pupils, teachers and lawmakers to ditch an algorithm that had downgraded A-level results for almost 40% of school leavers, with those in disadvantaged areas more adversely affected.
""Labour want and expect children to be back at school. Every day that schools were closed was a day of opportunity, learning and support lost. This situation was worsened by the exams fiasco and the government's chaotic approach to education,"" opposition Labour party leader Keir Starmer said.

""We cannot keep repeating those same mistakes. Young people's futures cannot be held back by the Conservatives’ incompetence.""

The effort signals that the ruling Socialist Party is seeking to boost participation in the upcoming vote, which part of the opposition had vowed to boycott on the grounds that it is rigged. 
Those pardoned via a presidential decree include legislator Freddy Guevara, who sought asylum in the Chilean diplomatic residence, as well as Roberto Marrero, who had served as chief of staff to opposition leader and congress chief Juan Guaido. 
Chief prosecutor Tarek Saab said in a telephone interview said that the pardons were meant to ""promote political debate"" and to ""strengthen the right to human suffrage."" 
""If they return to any act of terrorism, violence or coup-mongering, obviously this benefit will cease,"" he said.
Many of those mentioned participated in a failed 2019 rebellion that sought to persuade the military to drop their backing for Maduro but ultimately failed to sway top commanders. 
Some of those pardoned are imprisoned, while others have sought diplomatic asylum or are in exile. 
Opposition leaders say Maduro's 2018 re-election was fraudulent, and have recognized Guaido as the legitimate president. More than 50 other countries, including the United States, followed suit.
""Maduro isn't president and I'm not a delinquent,"" wrote lawmaker Americo de Grazia, who was mentioned in the decree. ""If you want to contribute to peace, give Venezuela a pardon from your usurpation of power.""
The measure made no mention of Leopoldo Lopez, one of the opposition's most high-profile leaders, who was jailed in 2014 for leading protests against Maduro and is now living in the Spanish diplomatic residence.
Nor does it mention military officers locked up on charges of plotting to overthrow Maduro.
Rights groups have harshly criticized Venezuela's government for arbitrarily jailing adversaries, often on charges made with little or no evidence and in violation of basic due process and parliamentary immunity of legislators. 
Maduro's government has in the past released small groups of jailed opposition leaders, but those releases have typically been followed by more such arrests.

The government denies holding political prisoners and says such accusations are part of U.S.-backed efforts to tarnish its image.

Conde, who was first elected in 2010, pushed through a change to the constitution that was approved by a referendum in March that was boycotted by the opposition. Talk of a potential third term sparked widespread protests that have killed at least 30 people over the past year.
Conde's supporters say the constitutional change acts as a reset button on the two-term limit.
The ruling Rally of the Guinean People (RPG) nominated Conde earlier this month to represent it in the Oct. 18 poll. At the time, Conde said he took note of the nomination, but he stopped short of formally accepting it.
""We have the immense privilege and joy of informing the Guinean population that (Conde) has granted our request: President Alpha Conde will be our candidate,"" the RPG and allied parties said in statement read on national television.
Conde is a longtime opposition leader whose election raised hopes for democratic progress. But his efforts to stay in power have raised concerns Guinea will go the way of other African countries whose rulers have refused to step down long after their mandates expired. 

Guinea is Africa's largest producer of the main aluminium ore, bauxite. It also has significant reserves of iron ore, including the massive Simandou reserve, the largest known deposit of its kind with more than 2 billion tonnes of high-grade ore.

Anger at Lebanon's political elite over an economic meltdown and this month's devastating port blast was evident as Macron arrived at the home of the 85-year old artist, feted as a national treasure and symbol of peace, transcending factional and sectarian divides in Lebanon and beyond.
Protesters gathered outside with placards reading ""No cabinet by, or with, the murderers"" and ""Don't be on the wrong side of history!"". Some chanted ""Adib No"", referring to new premier Mustapha Adib who was named by Lebanese leaders on Monday under French pressure.
Upon leaving, Macron stopped to speak with the crowd.
""I made a commitment to her (Fairouz), as I make a commitment to you here tonight, to do everything so that reforms are implemented and that Lebanon receives better. I promise you. I won't leave you,"" he could be heard saying in TV broadcasts.
Macron is visiting Beirut for the second time in less than a month to press for a new government made up of experts untainted by corruption and capable of rooting out graft, waste and negligence as well as rebuilding after the Aug. 4 explosion that wrecked swathes of Beirut, killing 190 people. 
BEAUTIFUL VISIT
Macron described his meeting with Fairouz as ""very beautiful, very strong"". ""I told her everything that she represented to me, of a Lebanon that we love and that many are expectant of, a nostalgia that many have.""
Asked about his favourite Fairouz song, he named ""To Beirut"", which local channels have played while showing images of the blast and its aftermath.
The enigmatic singer rarely speaks publicly but her lyrics fill the airwaves from Rabat to Baghdad.
""I love you in summer, I love you in winter,"" she sings in one of her most famous numbers, released before Lebanon's descent into its 1975-90 civil war, and when the nation was still famed as the Switzerland of the Middle East, attracting Hollywood idols to its fine restaurants and beaches.
Her songs were listened to across the religious and factional divide, whether Christian, Muslim or Druze, even as they spilled each others' blood on the streets.
Fairouz has drawn the admiration of other French presidents. Francois Mitterrand awarded her the Order of Arts and Letters in 1988 and Jacques Chirac handed her the Legion of Honour in 1998.
Fairouz, born Nouhad Haddad, made her first European television appearance in 1975 on a French show. In 1979, her song ""Paris, Oh Flower of Freedom"" included the words ""France, what do I tell you about my wounded country?""

During the civil war, Fairouz toured abroad, holding only one concert inside Lebanon - on a stage that crossed the frontline of the then-divided capital.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The Chilean government on Monday threatened to invoke a state security law to penalise striking truck drivers blocking arterial routes and damaging supply chains after talks between the two sides broke down.
Chile's interior minister Victor Perez said the government had made a ""serious and all-encompassing"" offer of greater security for the industry, without giving further details. 
Truckers are on their fifth day of strike action over violence in the country's south and want a raft of law and order bills fast-tracked through congress. 
""We believe the rejection of this proposal is a mistake, since they promised a peaceful demonstration that unfortunately has given rise to instances of supply chain interruption and road blockades,"" Perez said. 
The state security law is invoked during public protests or mobilizations and allows penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment for those who threaten state security. 
The truckers, backed by some agricultural and logging unions, are protesting over a spike in attacks on transport trucks and factories in recent months in and around the southern Araucania, a south-central region of Chile that has long been convulsed by a simmering conflict between the indigenous Mapuche and the Chilean government.
The strike is being led by the Confederation of Chilean Cargo Transport (CNTC), one of the country's three main truckers unions.
Jose Villagran, the CNTC's vice-president, told local media on Monday the government had offered ""crumbs"" and he wanted to negotiate with interior minister Perez directly.
""We truckers don't want crumbs,"" he said, according to Mega Noticias news site. ""We work on the highways, we have a lot of stamina, I don't think the government is able to hold out for longer than we can."" 
Earlier on Monday, Agriculture Minister Antonio Walker said two of the country's 16 regions were experiencing supply chain problems, while access had slowed to San Antonio port, one of the two biggest in the fruit, salmon and copper-exporting nation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secret-spilling website WikiLeaks, a pivotal player in the email leaks that buffeted the 2016 U.S. presidential election, suffered a brief outage on Monday.
Visitors to the site were met with an error message saying the security certificate used to ensure private communication with its users had expired and that access was forbidden.
WikiLeaks effectively became invisible to most internet users, a problem that was fixed several hours later when a new certificate was installed.
The blooper came at a particularly trying time for WikiLeaks, whose jailed founder Julian Assange is fighting extradition from Britain to the United States over charges connected to the disclosure of U.S. diplomatic secrets by former Army private Chelsea Manning in 2010.
Assange would later go on to publish tens of thousands of emails belonging to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, a development that might have contributed to her loss in the 2016 election.
A Senate report this month said WikiLeaks had played a key role in Russia's effort to assist Republican President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign against Clinton and likely knew it was helping Russian intelligence.
Messages left with Kristinn Hrafnsson, who replaced Assange as WikiLeaks' editor-in-chief after the latter's arrest, were not immediately returned.

PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Monday called for rioters and looters to be prosecuted, and slammed President Donald Trump for stoking violence in American cities gripped by protests over police brutality and racial inequality.
Biden's speech in battleground state Pennsylvania was his most forceful counter yet to accusations by Trump that he is weak on crime and that leaders in his Democratic Party have lost control over the mass demonstrations that in some instances have turned violent.
""Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting,"" Biden said from a converted steel mill in Pittsburgh. ""It's lawlessness, plain and simple, and those who do it should be prosecuted.""
Trump, who trails his rival in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election, has argued he stands for ""law and order."" The theme featured prominently at his nominating convention last week as he sought to motivate his political base and broaden his support. 
Republicans deny Trump is seeking to exacerbate violence with incendiary rhetoric. But Biden on Monday said Trump was sowing chaos.
""This president long ago forfeited any moral leadership in this country,"" Biden said. ""He can't stop the violence because for years he has fomented it.""
Trump, noting he had watched Biden's remarks, said in a tweet afterward that the former vice president seemed to blame police more than the ""Rioters, Anarchists, Agitators, and Looters."" 
Biden has repeatedly condemned disorder at demonstrations but has defended peaceful protesters, arguing justice must be served in cases of ""unwarranted police violence.""
Biden pushed back on Republican assertions that he catered to his party's most liberal members.
""Ask yourself, do I look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters? Really?"" Biden asked. 
SWING STATE
Biden's visit to Pennsylvania, an important swing state that helped propel Trump to victory in 2016, marked an unusual trip afield for the former vice president, who has worked mostly from his Delaware home since March, when the coronavirus began spreading widely in the country.
His campaign has indicated that Biden expects to increase his travel to the states that will decide the election as the vote draws nearer. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are both due to campaign in Pennsylvania this week.
In Pittsburgh, Biden depicted an America that was unsafe under Trump, with COVID-19 killing thousands of people a week and an economy in tatters.
He said he wanted a country safe from the coronavirus, crime, racially motivated violence and ""bad cops.""
""And let's be crystal clear: Safe from four more years of Donald Trump,"" he said. 
Samuel DeMarco, the Republican chairman in Allegheny County, where Biden was speaking, said his speech showed ""desperation.""
""We have violent protests for 90 some days and now he's going to address it and try to blame Trump. Good luck with that,"" he said.
Demonstrations have swept the United States since the killing in May of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
New protests erupted in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last week following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, another African-American man, multiple times in front of his children, paralyzing him.
Tensions between rival protest groups have led to more shooting deaths. Last week, a white teenager was charged with shooting three demonstrators, two fatally, in Kenosha, and a clash in Portland, Oregon, over the weekend resulted in a fatal shooting.
Trump is set to visit Kenosha on Tuesday, but Democrats including the state's governor have urged him to stay away.
The White House said it is making efforts to reach Blake's family but has been unable to connect. 

Biden has been in touch with Blake's family. As he delivered pizzas to firefighters in Pittsburgh on Monday, Biden told reporters he hoped to visit Wisconsin soon.

Under the deal, brokered by a Qatari envoy, Hamas would end the launching of incendiary balloons, and Israel would end air strikes, said a Palestinian official close to the mediation.
COGAT, Israel's liaison agency to the Palestinian territories, confirmed that after security consultations led by Defence Minister Benny Gantz, Gaza's main goods crossing would reopen and fishermen would be allowed back to work, up to 15 nautical miles.
A COGAT statement said the decisions were ""subject to the continuation of the calm and the security stability"" but warned that if Hamas failed to deliver, Israel would ""act accordingly.""
Hamas said the understanding would ease the way for implementation of projects “that will serve the people of Gaza, and alleviate the suffering amid the coronavirus wave.”
Palestinians and humanitarian groups have urged an easing of the Israeli-led blockade on Gaza, fearing even more hardship after the first outbreak of COVID-19 there last week.

Israel says the restrictions are necessary because of security fears over Hamas, which it regards as a terrorist organisation.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian police said on Monday they arrested more than 400 people in a major nationwide operation that highlights the complex structure and vast reach of the nation's largest drug gang, the PCC.
According to the police, 422 arrest warrants and 201 search and seizure warrants were fulfilled across 19 states and the Federal District, and up to 252 million reais ($46 million) of assets held by those targeted were frozen.
Those arrested will be charged with money laundering, drug trafficking and directing criminal organizations from within prisons, the federal police said, charges that can carry a combined sentence of up to 28 years in prison.
The PCC, or First Capital Command, is one of the most powerful organized crime groups in South America. It emerged as a prison gang, with tens of thousands of members, and has a stranglehold over various aspects of the region's drug trade.
Brazil, long-regarded as a cocaine-consuming nation, has become one of the top suppliers to Europe in recent years, transforming the country's role, and that of its major gangs, in the trans-Atlantic drug trade.
At a Monday press conference, federal police detective Alexsander Castro said some of the allegedly illicit proceeds were channeled into a fund that was used to pay salaries to PCC members.
Robert Muggah, co-founder of Brazil-based security and development think tank Igarape Institute, said that while Monday's operation will ""sting,"" it is ""unlikely to make a major dent on the PCC"" given the organization's vast size, hierarchy and deep roots in the country's prison system.
""The PCC have increased their overall capability and reach in recent years. Their control over the rank and file is legendary,"" Muggah wrote in an e-mail.
""Brazil will never eradicate the PCC until it deals with its over-crowded prisons,"" he added.

Turkey and Greece, NATO allies, vehemently disagree over claims to hydrocarbon resources in the area based on conflicting views on the extent of their continental shelves in waters dotted with mostly Greek islands.
Both sides have held military exercises in the east Mediterranean, highlighting the potential for the dispute over the extent of their continental shelves to escalate.
The Turkish navy issued a new advisory saying that the work of the Oruc Reis would continue until Sept. 12. It had previously been scheduled to work until Sept. 1.
The advisory referred to a specific exploration area. But on Saturday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the Oruc Reis would continue working for the next 90 days as it moved gradually closer to the Turkish province of Antalya.
Seismic surveys are part of preparatory work for potential hydrocarbon exploration. Turkey has also been exploring for hydrocarbon resources in the Black Sea and discovered a 320 billion cubic metre (11.3 trillion cubic feet) gas field.
Separately, Turkey also said it will hold a military exercise off northwest Cyprus until Sept. 11.

""The subcommittee will have no other choice but to receive testimony through compulsory process,"" they wrote.
The State and Defense departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

They cited U.S. military and U.N. reports that said the Taliban have not severed links with al Qaeda as the Feb. 29 accord required. They also noted that the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Army General Kenneth McKenzie, said on June 10 that conditions for a full U.S. withdrawal had not been met.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - France's President Emmanuel Macron said he would press for reforms aimed at dragging Lebanon out of a financial abyss as he began a visit to Beirut hours after Lebanese leaders named diplomat Mustapha Adib new PM on Monday under French pressure.
With its economy in deep crisis, a swathe of Beirut in tatters following a huge explosion on Aug. 4, and sectarian tensions rising, Lebanon is facing the biggest threat to its stability since the 1975-90 civil war.
Macron was met at the airport by President Michel Aoun as the French leader made his second visit in less than a month. ""So President, it's been a busy day, hasn't it,"" Macron told Aoun.
Macron told reporters said he wanted to ""ensure that the government that is formed will implement the necessary reforms.""
Foreign donors say Lebanon must tackle corruption and waste before they release financial support.
Senior Lebanese officials said Macron's mediation was essential in securing agreement on a new prime minister in the 48 hours before consensus emerged on Adib, the former ambassador to Germany. Politicians had been deadlocked last week.
""The opportunity for our country is small and the mission I have accepted is based on all the political forces acknowledging that,"" said Adib, who won the support of nearly all Lebanon's main parties in consultations hosted by Aoun.
""There is no time for talk and promises ... It's the time to work with everyone's cooperation,"" he said.
He called for the formation of a government of competent specialists in record time, an immediate start to reforms and a deal with the International Monetary Fund. Lebanon's talks with the IMF have been stalled since July.
""We welcome the nomination of a new prime minister and hope that a new government will be formed shortly with a mandate to implement the policies and reforms that Lebanon needs to address the current crisis and restore sustainable growth,"" an IMF spokesperson told Reuters.
UNDER PRESSURE
Adib, who has a doctorate in law and political science, later visited areas hardest hit by the explosion that killed some 190 people and injured 6,500.
""Our children died. We don't recognise you,"" a passer-by shouted at him. Another offered to shake hands with Adib, who wore a mask against COVID-19.
The explosion, in which volatile chemicals stored unsafely for years detonated, led to the resignation of the previous government, now acting as caretaker.
Since October, the financial crisis has sunk Lebanon's currency, locked savers out of deposits held by a paralysed banking system and fuelled poverty. The root cause is decades of corruption and waste overseen by a political elite.
Macron's visit coincides with Lebanon's centenary, at a time of profound doubts that it has a future as a viable state under the sway of former warlords and sectarian leaders loyal to different regional masters, Iran and Saudi Arabia. 
Macron made a series of phone calls to Lebanese leaders at the weekend that were vital to securing consensus on Adib.
""It was the pressure of his calls to everyone, the pressure of his coming to Lebanon, the pressure of everyone not wanting to upset him,"" a senior Lebanese politician said.
A French presidency source said Macron was demanding ""a government of mission, clean, efficient, able to implement the necessary reforms in Lebanon"".
Macron said on Friday that the exceptional moment facing Lebanon led him to increase pressure. ""France has convinced its European and American partners and a good part of the regional partners that we are honest brokers,"" he said.
Adib's name surfaced on Sunday when he was nominated by former PMs, including Saad al-Hariri who heads the biggest Sunni Muslim party. Under the Lebanese system, the post of premier must go to a Sunni.
Hariri's Future Movement and the powerful Iranian-backed Shi'ite party Hezbollah were among those nominating him.

With Hariri's backing, Adib will enjoy more support than Hassan Diab's outgoing government, nominated by Hezbollah and its allies which together have a parliamentary majority.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia imposed travel bans on President Alexander Lukashenko and 29 other Belarusian officials on Monday, signalling impatience with the West's cautious approach by announcing sanctions without waiting for the rest of the EU. 
The three small Baltic states have led calls firm measures against Lukashenko, who is accused by opponents and the West of rigging an Aug. 9 election to prolong his 26-year rule.
The sanctions target officials they accuse of having a role in vote-rigging and in violence against protesters since the election. The inclusion of Lukashenko was a prod to other European countries, so far reluctant to back measures against him personally.
Belarus expressed ""sincere disappointment"" and signalled it would retaliate in kind to what it called ""hasty steps"".
""We said that we need peaceful dialogue and agreement between the regime and society, but we see that the regime is not ready for that,"" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said. ""We see that we need to move forward and to show an example to other countries.""
The European Union has been working on a list of individuals in Belarus to target with similar sanctions, expected to exclude Lukashenko. Western countries have mostly been cautious, wary of provoking an intervention from Russia.
""We have said before that Belarus will need to take adequate measures to respond to the initiators of these steps. This will be done,"" Anatoly Glaz, spokesman of the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, told RIA news agency.
The three Baltic states are all members of the EU and NATO, and Lithuania and Latvia border Belarus. Lithuania has been hosting Belarusian opposition presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled there after the election her supporters say she won.
Tsikhanouskaya will speak to the U.N. Security Council on Friday at Estonia's invitation, her spokesman said.
Seeking to keep pressure on Lukashenko to step down, Tsikhanouskaya's team called for students to hold a one-day nationwide boycott of schools and universities on Tuesday to coincide with the start of the new school year. 
HUGE DEMONSTRATIONS
Three weeks into a mass demonstration movement that has peaked at weekends, tens of thousands of protesters again took to the streets in central Minsk on Sunday.
Lukashenko has shown no sign of bowing to the protests. The former Soviet collective farm boss has denied rigging the election but on Monday referred to Belarusian public life being governed by ""a somewhat authoritarian system"".
Lukashenko has threatened to cut off European transit routes across his country in retaliation against any sanctions. Goods from landlocked Belarus account for almost a third of Lithuania's rail traffic and port volume, and Belarus is also an overland route for European goods bound for Russia.
Belarus is Russia's closest ally among former Soviet states, and its territory is integral to Moscow's European defence strategy. President Vladimir Putin has invited Lukashenko to Moscow, a sign of Kremlin support, and the two countries' foreign ministers will hold talks on Wednesday in Moscow.
Last week, the Kremlin announced it had set up a reserve force able to intervene in Belarus, though Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated on Monday that Moscow still sees no need for action.
During the three weeks of protests, Lukashenko has lost the support of a range of public figures, from actors to sportsmen. 

On Monday, the Catholic Church in Belarus, which has criticised the harsh treatment of protesters by the security forces, said its head, Tadeush Kondrusevich, had been barred from re-entering the country after a trip to Poland. The border guards declined to comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States on Monday vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution on foreign militants fighting with groups like Islamic State because it did not address repatriation, an issue that has long pitted Washington against its European allies. 
The other 14 council members voted in favor of the resolution drafted by Indonesia, isolating the United States. 
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, said the draft text aiming to reinforce international action on counterterrorism ""was worse than no resolution at all.""
""It fails to even include reference to the crucial first step – repatriation to countries of origin or nationality,"" she said. ""The United States will not participate in such a cynical and willfully oblivious farce.""
The U.S. veto comes after Indonesia, council president for August, last week dismissed Washington's attempt to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran because 13 members had expressed their opposition to the move.
The United States wants foreign militants sent home and either prosecuted or rehabilitated there. European states, however, have been reluctant to try their nationals at home, citing difficulty in collecting evidence, concerns about a public backlash and the risk of fresh attacks on European soil.
Thousands of foreign militants from dozens of countries are being held by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeast Syria. The Kurdish-led forces also hold tens of thousands of Syrian and foreign women and children - family members of suspected militants - in squalid camps.
The draft resolution encouraged states to facilitate ""the return of the children to their countries of origin, as appropriate and on a case by case basis.""
A spokesperson for Britain's Foreign Office said: ""We regret the resolution was not adopted. We are working closely with international partners to reduce the risk posed to us collectively by foreign fighters.""

Last month, Zimbabwe agreed to pay $3.5 billion in compensation to local white farmers whose land was forcibly taken by the government to resettle Black families, moving a step closer to resolving one the most divisive policies of the Robert Mugabe era. 
Under Zimbabwean laws passed during a short period of opposition government but ignored by Mugabe, foreign white farmers protected by treaties between their governments and Zimbabwe should be compensated for both land and other assets.
In that regard, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube and Lands and Agriculture Minister Anxious Masuka said in a joint statement that these farmers should apply for their land back.
That means, in some instances the government would ""revoke the offer letters of resettled (Black) farmers currently occupying those pieces of land and offer them alternative land elsewhere,"" the ministers said.
But removing the Black beneficiaries from the land could prove practically and politically difficult.
""Where the situation presently obtaining on the ground makes it impractical to restore land in this category to its former owners, government will offer the former farm owners alternative land elsewhere as restitution where such land is available,"" the statement said.
The ministers said other white farmers whose land had been earmarked for acquisition by the government but were still on the properties, can apply to lease the land for 99 years, just like their Black counterparts.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa has said the land reform could not be reversed but paying of compensation was key to mending ties with the West.
The programme still divides public opinion in Zimbabwe, where the number of white farmers has dropped to just over 200 from 4,500 when land reforms began 20 years ago, according to the predominantly white commercial farmers union.

During its decade-long debt crisis which erupted in late 2009, Greece slashed its defence spending under the terms of three international bailouts that helped it stay afloat. Greece emerged from its third bailout in August 2018. 
In an interview with Alpha TV, Finance Minister Christos Staikouras said that his mandate includes ""supporting the armed forces' prevention force"". 
He made the comments as tensions between Greece and its NATO Turkey have escalated over energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean region.
""We, the finance ministry, will do everything possible to support the government's decisions in this area,"" Staikouras said. 
He said that the government's strategy does not only concern arm purchases and will unfold over the next years starting in 2020, without providing a figure on the money that could be invested or any further details. 
""It depends on the government's and the defence ministry's orders on certain priorities,"" he said. 
Greece has created a cash buffer of 34 billion euros ($40.6 billion) from unused bailout funds and money raised from markets. The country was looking forward to an economic recovery this year but the coronavirus pandemic has turned its expectations upside down and the government now sees its economy shrinking up to 10%.

""We learned today that a court had barred our candidate (Daniil) Markelov from elections,"" Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said in the video, published on YouTube.
Navalny filmed the video promoting Novosibirsk opposition candidates during his trip to Siberia, days before he collapsed on his flight back to Moscow. The local election is scheduled for Sept. 13.
His allies published the footage on Monday and it was viewed nearly half a million times in the hours after its release.
""One of the most prosperous cities in the world could be here but a Russian panel ghetto grew instead,"" Navalny said in the video, referring to concrete panels used in Russia since the Soviet era for building multi-storey apartment blocks.
""Our goal is to free the capital of Siberia from the occupiers,"" he said.
Markelov had been expected to run against local developer Alexei Dzhulai from the ruling United Russia party. United Russia's local office could not be immediately reached for comment.
Navalny is in a medically-induced coma in a Berlin hospital, which said its initial medical examination pointed to poisoning, though Russian doctors who had treated Navalny in a Siberian hospital have contradicted that diagnosis.
The regional court withdrew Markelov's registration as candidate after finding that two of 121 signatures in his support were invalid, Markelov said. He told Reuters he would appeal the decision in the Russian supreme court.

A Russian court in July convicted Trevor Reed, a student at the University of North Texas, of endangering the lives of two police officers, a charge Reed denies.
""Trevor mentally seems to be doing as well as can be expected... It pains me to see him detained under these circumstances,"" said ambassador John Sullivan after a visit to Vodnik prison.
""It is important that he gets the medical treatment that he needs, and we will be advocating for that vigorously - and, of course, for his release,"" said Sullivan, who described the evidence against Reed as ""laughable"".
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun spoke to Russian officials about the case during a visit last week, demanding his release, the ambassador added. 
Prosecutors accused Reed of grabbing a police officer who was behind the wheel of a car after the American was detained on Aug. 15 last year. That, they said, caused the vehicle to swerve dangerously. He was also accused of elbowing a second officer. 
Reed, who said he traveled to Moscow in May, 2019, to learn Russian and visit his Russian girlfriend, has said he does not remember the events of that evening because he was drunk when he was detained after leaving a party in Moscow.
Sullivan said he also hopes to visit another former U.S. Marine, Paul Whelan, who was sentenced in June to 16 years in jail for espionage, a charge he denied.

""I will be planning to travel there at the earliest opportunity. To visit with Paul, see how he is doing, and discuss his situation,"" the ambassador said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Comments by a senior U.S. official and moves by Britain towards the possible fast-tracking of COVID-19 vaccines show the West now accepts Russia was right to approve a vaccine as early as August, a Russian official said on Monday. 
Russia granted regulatory approval to a COVID-19 vaccine this month after less than two months of human testing, prompting some Western experts to question its safety and efficacy.
The head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has since said he would be willing to bypass the normal approval process to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine as long as officials were convinced the benefits outweigh the risks.
The British government last week set out plans that would allow Britain's medical regulator to grant temporary authorization for any coronavirus vaccine before it has received a full license if it meets safety and quality standards.
The United States and London were now ""exactly following the example of Russia,"" said Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Russia's sovereign wealth fund, which has been heavily involved in Russia's vaccine program.
""The Western world was shocked by Russia's success (in producing a potential vaccine) and had to go through four stages of accepting the inevitable: denial, anger, depression, and ultimately acceptance,"" he said in a statement. 
""Recent statements show that we have already passed the stage of depression and it has now been accepted that Russia's approach is the correct one.""
Russia has now begun Phase III trials of the ""Sputnik V"" vaccine that will test its efficacy on a bigger group of volunteers. It is also preparing to approve a second vaccine against COVID-19 in late September or early October.
Health Minister Mikhail Murashko has said mass vaccination of high-risk groups will begin in November-December.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",Top envoy says U.S. preparing tighter oil sanctions on Venezuela,"By Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is looking to tighten oil sanctions on Venezuela in the near future, top U.S. envoy for the country told Reuters on Monday, by potentially removing exemptions that allow some oil companies to receive crude oil from the OPEC member.
U.S. President Donald Trump has ramped up sanctions on Venezuela's state-run PDVSA, its key foreign partners and customers since it first imposed measures against the company in early 2019, seeking to oust the left-leaning Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro after a 2018 re-election considered a sham by most Western nations.
""We think our sanctions have been extremely effective in reducing income to the regime but we think we can make them more effective. So we are going to be doing some things to tighten up in the near future,"" Elliott Abrams, U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela said in a phone interview.
The sanctions have already deprived PDVSA of most of its long-term oil customers, reducing oil exports to below 400,000 barrels per day (bpd), their lowest level in almost 80 years.
But they have so far failed to loosen Maduro's grip in power - something that has frustrated Trump, officials say. With November's presidential election approaching, Washington is preparing to toughen its stance on Venezuela, especially the sanctions on its oil and gold industries.
Reuters reported earlier this month that Washington was moving to set an October deadline for winding down all trade of Venezuelan oil, including swaps of crude for fuel and payments of pending debt with crude, the sources said.
Abrams declined to confirm the exact scope of the action but said, ""There are some exceptions that were put in place last year that we have been looking at and that we may feel can be removed.""
A handful of European and Asian customers have continued taking Venezuelan oil under specific authorizations granted since last year by the U.S. Treasury for transactions that do not involve cash payments to Maduro's administration.
The list includes Italy's Eni, Spain's Repsol (OTC:REPYY), India's Reliance Industries and Thailand Tipco Asphalt.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>",Oregon state police called to Portland as officials warn of escalating violence,"(Reuters) - Oregon state police were poised on Monday to return to Portland after a fatal shooting this weekend, as clashes escalated between an armed right-wing group and protesters demanding racial justice and police reforms.
Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, released a plan Sunday night in response to violence that she said was stoked by an armed right-wing group called Patriot Prayer. In addition to bringing in state police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney would commit more resources to prosecuting criminal offenders.
""Every Oregonian has the right to freely express their views without fear of deadly violence. I will not allow Patriot Prayer and armed white supremacists to bring more bloodshed to our streets,"" Brown said in a statement.
Protests have roiled downtown Portland every night for more than three months following the May 25 killing of George Floyd, the Black man who died under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis.
The demonstrators, demanding reforms of police practices they view as racist and abusive, have frequently clashed with law enforcement and on occasion with counter-protesters associated with right-wing militia groups.
On Monday, Portland police said 29 people were arrested overnight after taking part in an unlawful gathering in northeast Portland where rocks and eggs were thrown at officers.
Two people arrested had loaded handguns and others had knives and rocks, the police said in a statement. 
The clashes have exacerbated national political divisions. Republican President Donald Trump has blamed the unrest on the failure of Democratic-run governments, while Democrats say his divisive rhetoric has emboldened violent right-wing activists.
""Portland is a mess, and it has been for many years. If this joke of a mayor doesn’t clean it up, we will go in and do it for them!"" Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday.
Trump has sought to crack down on protests as part of his bid to win re-election on Nov. 3. In July, he deployed federal agents to Portland to guard a federal courthouse in the midst of protests, which Democrats and civil liberties groups criticized as federal overreach. 
Trump was scheduled to visit Kenosha, Wisconsin, this week, the latest U.S. city where protests against racism and excessive use of force by police at times degenerated into violence. Violent protests have rocked the city since the Aug. 23 shooting by a white police officer that left a Black man, Jacob Blake, paralyzed. Last week, a white teenager was charged with shooting three demonstrators - two fatally.
EXPECTED ESCALATION
Authorities have not identified the shooting victim in Portland, but the New York Times reported the man gunned down was wearing a hat with the insignia of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer. On Sunday, the leader of the group, Joey Gibson, appeared to confirm that the victim was a member whom he knew.
Trump later re-tweeted a photo of a man identified as Jay Bishop and described him in that post as “a good American that loved his country and Backed the Blue,” an apparent reference to police. “He was murdered in Portland by ANTIFA.”
Trump wrote, “Rest in Peace Jay!” in his retweet.
Members of the small right-wing group Patriot Prayer have clashed with Black Lives Matter protesters for the past two weekends in Portland.
Gibson, who faces felony riot charges for a 2019 clash in Portland, said in an Aug. 17 post on the group's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, ""If the 'leaders' refuse to protect the innocent then it is the obligation of the people to stand for justice."" 
Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell said on Sunday that authorities were investigating whether Saturday's shooting was connected to skirmishes that night between a caravan of protesters driving through the downtown district in pickup trucks waving pro-Trump flags and counter-protesters on the streets.
Video on social media showed individuals in the beds of the pickups firing paint-balls and spraying chemical irritants at opposing demonstrators as they rode by, while those on the street hurled objects at the trucks.
Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said on Sunday that city officials were bracing for more violence, citing social media posts vowing revenge for Saturday's shooting.

“For those of you saying on Twitter this morning that you plan to come to Portland to seek retribution, I’m calling on you to stay away,” Wheeler said.

The African National Congress (ANC) has been buffeted in recent weeks by reports of graft during the coronavirus crisis, with state investigators probing irregularities in government tenders worth 5 billion rand ($297 million).
Ramaphosa, who replaced scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma as ANC leader more than two and a half years ago, has staked his reputation on rooting out graft but has found it hard to make much progress given deep divisions in his fractured party.
But, stung by allegations of graft during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ramaphosa wrote to ANC members earlier this month saying its ""leaders stand accused of corruption"" and that the ANC ""does stand as accused number one"".
Ramaphosa told an ANC news conference on Monday that the party's National Executive Committee also decided that officials convicted of corruption should resign from leadership positions.

The ANC will put in place a mechanism for leaders to make regular declarations of financial interests, and guidelines will be developed on ANC leaders and their families doing business with government and public entities, Ramaphosa added.

The row dates from 2017 when the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a boycott on Qatar, severing diplomatic and transport ties and accusing it of supporting terrorism. The countries closed their airspace to Qatari aircraft.
Doha denies allegations of supporting terrorism.
Hearings this week at the World Court in The Hague will not take an in-depth look at the merits of the UAE case, but deal only with jurisdiction.
Qatar will have a chance to reply to the UAE standpoint on Wednesday. A ruling on jurisdiction is expected later this year. 
According to Qatar, which filed the case with the International Court of Justice in 2018, the UAE has as part of the boycott expelled thousands of Qataris and closed down the offices of the Doha-based Al-Jazeera news channel.
The ICJ, the highest United Nations court for inter-state disputes, handed Qatar a small victory in a related case about the ongoing dispute about the blockade when it ruled in July that the U.N. aviation body had jurisdiction over the closing of air space to Qatar.
Addressing the boycott, UAE lawyer Abdalla Hamdan Alnaqbi told the court on Monday that the measures against Qatar ""have nothing to do with racial discrimination"".
He said Qatar was trying to apply the United Nations' 1969 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ""beyond its proper scope"".
Cases before the ICJ generally takes years to come to a definitive ruling. World Court verdicts are final, but the court has no means to enforce its decisions.

Unlike most other European countries, Sweden has kept many businesses, restaurants and most schools open, while not recommending the use of face masks, which remain a rare sight unlike in neighbouring Denmark, Norway and Finland. 
But after the public health agency (FHM) said two weeks ago that it may issue new recommendations, Swedes appear to be stockpiling.
Face mask sales at online pharmacist Apotea have increased to around 400,000 units a week in the past two to three weeks from 150,000 in previous weeks, CEO Par Svardson said. 
At drug store Apoteket, with total annual sales around 47 billion crowns ($5.45 billion), face mask sales have jumped about 30% in the same weeks, to weekly levels equivalent to an entire year's turnover, according to a spokesman. 
""It feels like FHM, from their previous hard line of saying 'no', are now open to looking at saying 'yes',"" Svardson said, adding he would expect a five- to tenfold increase in face mask sales in the event of a change in recommendations over their use.
Sweden has so far rejected recommending or making mandatory the use of face masks in some public spaces, as many countries in Europe have done. Health Agency chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has said they have little proven effect and could lead to a false sense of security among wearers.
But health agency director-general Johan Carlson told a press conference on Aug. 18 that there may be situations - such as doctor and dentist visits and on public transport - where face mask recommendations could be issued.
Sweden's death toll relative to its population has far outstripped those of its neighbours although it remains lower than in some European countries that adopted strict lockdowns such as Britain and Spain.

The suspects - three Russians and a Ukrainian - are being tried for murder and shooting down the passenger plane over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people onboard. 
The four men remain at large and only one has legal representation in the trial, which is being conducted at a courtroom near Amsterdam.
So far, 316 relatives of those who died said they plan to seek damages and 76 intend to exercise a right to speak during the trial, said Peter Langstraat, who represents 450 family members.
The claims have not been filed yet because the lawyers have asked the court to first rule whether Dutch or Ukrainian law should be applied when requesting damages.
Any court decision to award damages would hinge on a guilty verdict for the suspects, in a trial expected to last more than a year.
MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down by a missile fired from territory held by pro-Russian rebels during fighting in eastern Ukraine.
After years of collecting evidence, a Dutch-led international Joint Investigation team (JIT) last year said the missile launcher used to hit the jet came from a Russian army base just across the border.
In July, the Dutch government said it was filing a suit against Moscow, which it holds responsible for the disaster, at the European Court of Human Rights. Roughly two-thirds of the victims were Dutch.
The Kremlin has consistently denied involvement in the incident.
Only one defendant, Oleg Pulatov, has sent defense counsel to represent him. 

Pulatov's lawyers told judges on Monday that they still have not been able to meet their client in person, due mainly to the coronavirus pandemic.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Days after the port explosion that ravaged Beirut, a news anchor at a little-watched state TV channel declared he was leaving Lebanon for good.
""I can no longer stay in a land that is a graveyard for dreams. I'm leaving because I'm disgusted by you,"" Wassim Oraby said in an angry tirade against the ruling elite.
The broadcast resonated with Lebanese who blame sectarian, political leaders for pushing their country to ruin with decades of corruption and infighting.
It is a well-worn path for the Lebanese: to emigrate in search of ""any kind of normal"", in the words of 30-year-old web developer Darine Tamer, who is filling out immigration forms.
The warehouse explosion on Aug. 4, which killed at least 190 people, served as a final wake-up call for her and many others who were already suffering from an economic collapse without precedent, soaring prices and bouts of unrest. 
She will join a diaspora thought to be three times the size of the country’s population due to past emigration waves in Lebanon’s tumultuous history.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Trends shows searches for the word ""immigration"" from Lebanon hit a 10-year peak after the huge stockpile of ammonium nitrate detonated at Beirut port. Officials have blamed it on negligence. 
The blast injured thousands, destroying the homes of people who had just lost jobs and whose savings were trapped in the banks.
The latest exodus of Lebanese packing their bags will strip the country of academics, doctors, artists and others it needs if it is to start over. 
They include some who returned in the 1990s to a reconstruction boom after 15 years of civil war, which Lebanon never fully recovered from. Now, they were sending their kids off.
As the last of her siblings still in Lebanon, Tamer never thought she would go too. Her brother lives in Australia and her sister left to Canada. But she is forced to maintain two jobs to catch up with a spiraling currency crash. A startup where she loved working closed this year when investor money dried up.
""Your life is worthless here. You can't build anything. Every few years, you have to reset, and it's hopeless. It's just insane to keep hoping.""
ANYWHERE BUT HERE
Jess Talhame, a 23-year-old psychology graduate, is among Lebanese who can draw on dual nationalities their families acquired in past migrations.
Her parents fled the civil war to spend three decades in Canada, popular among Lebanese emigrants. They returned to raise their kids in the country they called home. Now Talhame, who has been without work for a year, has booked a one-way ticket out. 
""When the blast hit, I was done,"" Talhame said. She shuttled between hospital beds after the blast shattered her friend's cheekbones, and days later, her boyfriend was hit by a rubber bullet at a protest against the political elite.
""It's like you want to fight for your country but you also want to stay alive so you can fight for it.""
Many with lesser means and fortunes will not be able to leave.

At a recent job interview, Tamer recalled, she laughed when someone asked where she sees herself in five years. ""I can't even tell you where I see myself tomorrow, but it's not here.""

BLED, Slovenia (Reuters) - EU-mediated negotiations on normalizing relations between Serbia and its former province of Kosovo could lead to a deal within months, the EU's envoy dealing with one of Europe's toughest territorial disputes said on Monday.
Ethnic Albanian majority Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 1999 after a NATO-led bombing campaign to curtail ethnic warfare. Serbia, backed by its large Slavic and Orthodox Christian ally Russia, does not recognize Kosovo's independence, a precondition for Belgrade's future membership of the EU.
Normalization negotiations broke down in 2018 but resumed in July after Kosovo lifted stiff import tariffs on Serbian goods.
Asked a deal could be reached, EU envoy Miroslav Lajcak told reporters on the sidelines of a regional conference in Slovenia that it would be a mistake to forecast a date as there were still ""very complicated issues to address...
""Let's see how much time we need but I am speaking about months, I am not speaking about years,"" he added. ""Both parties are committed, both parties are serious, respecting each other.""
Apart from the EU-brokered diplomatic track, top-level delegations from Serbia and Kosovo will meet in the United States next week to address economic cooperation. 
After meeting Lajcak at the conference, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said he had presented Serbia's goals to the EU envoy, above all the implementation of an earlier deal allowing an association of communities grouping Kosovo's minority Serbs. 
""I greatly respect what Lajcak is saying about normalization..., which is legally and politically different from what Pristina and some others are saying,"" the Serbian news agency Tanjug quoted Vucic as saying. 

The U.S. talks were previously set for June but delayed after Kosovo President Hashim Thaci was indicted for alleged war crimes during the 1998-99 guerrilla uprising against Serbian rule and its aftermath. He has denied the charges.

KIGALI (Reuters) - Rwanda said on Monday it had detained Paul Rusesabagina - the man who was hailed a hero in a Hollywood movie about the country's 1994 genocide - on terrorism charges and paraded him in front of media in handcuffs.
Rusesabagina was played by Don Cheadle in the Oscar-nominated film 'Hotel Rwanda' which told the story of how he used his job as a hotel manager and his connections with the Hutu elite to protect Tutsis fleeing the slaughter. 
On Monday, two police officers brought the 66-year-old to the headquarters of Rwanda Investigations Bureau and let media film him and take photographs.
Rusesabagina, who wore a facemask, did not speak. He has in the past said he is the victim of a smear campaign in Rwanda. 
""Rusesabagina is suspected of being a founder or a leader or sponsor or member of violent armed extremist terror outfits ... operating out of various places in the region and abroad,"" the bureau's spokesman, Thierry Murangira, told journalists.
He said Rusesabagina would face several charges including ""terrorism, financing terrorism ... arson, kidnap and murder.""
He did not say how or where Rusesabagina was arrested.
Rusesabagina moved abroad after the genocide and won worldwide acclaim, receiving the United States’ highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 2005.
But back home, he has sparked outrage with warnings of another genocide, this time by Tutsis against Hutus. He has drawn criticism from some genocide survivors and president Paul Kagame who accused him of exploiting the genocide for commercial gain. 
In 2010, the prosecutor general told Reuters authorities had evidence Rusesabagina had funded terrorist groups, though no charges were brought. 
Authorities have since said he had a role in a string of alleged attacks by National Liberation Front (FLN) rebels in southern Rwanda along the border with Burundi in 2018.
Rusesabagina, whose father was Hutu but mother and wife were Tutsi, has denied exaggerating his role in rescuing Tutsis. He has not publicly responded to the charges of supporting armed groups.
About 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were butchered in 100 days in the central African nation from April 6, 1994.

The 22-year-old student, who was a leading figure in large anti-government protests last year, was taken to hospital late on Sunday after being assaulted by two people outside his apartment in western Moscow, his allies said on social media.
They published pictures of his bloodied face covered in bruises and gashes. 
He was among more than 1,000 people detained in Moscow in July 2019 in one of the biggest crackdowns on anti-Kremlin demonstrators in recent years. He and other protesters had taken to the streets to call for free elections.
A Russian court last year found him guilty of inciting extremism on his YouTube channel and banned him from using the Internet for two years, a move he decried as politically motivated.
The Moscow police force said it was seeking to identify and detain Zhukov's assailants, who his allies said had fled the scene of the attack on scooters. If convicted of assault, Zhukov's attackers could face up to two years in jail. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he hoped Zhukov's attackers would be found and punished. 
Peter Stano, a spokesman for the European Commission, condemned the attack on Zhukov at a news briefing in Brussels.
""We wish him a speedy recovery and we expect that those responsible for this brutal and cowardly attack will be brought to justice as soon as possible,"" said Stano.
He said it looked to be part of what he called ""a very negative trend on human rights in Russia"" and attacks on people who expressed dissenting views. 
Zhukov said on Sunday that due to his Kremlin opposition activities he was expelled last week from the Moscow university where he had been studying.

Another Russian opposition activist, Alexei Navalny, remains in a medically induced coma in a German hospital after what his allies say was a poisoning.

PODGORICA (Reuters) - President Milo Djukanovic's pro-Western ruling party suffered a major setback in Montenegro's parliamentary election, results showed on Monday, winning most votes but falling short of a majority and so requiring a coalition partner to stay in power.
The Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), which has governed the tiny Adriatic republic for three decades, secured 35.06% of votes in Sunday's poll, the state election commission said, based on the completed preliminary vote count.
An alliance of mainly Serb nationalist parties named For the Future of Montenegro, which seeks closer ties with neighboring Serbia and with Russia, won 32.55% and a centrist grouping also opposed to the DPS, Peace is our Nation, got 12.53% of the vote.
The outcome is a disappointment for Djukanovic, who has steered Montenegro through the bloody collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s and the dissolution of a joint state with Serbia in 2006 and then took his country into NATO in 2017. 
Trying to strike an upbeat note, Djukanovic told his supporters late on Sunday that the DPS, as the largest party, could secure 40 deputies in the 81-seat parliament with the help of smaller parties, but that is still one short of a majority.
""The regime has fallen,"" said the leader of the pro-Serb opposition alliance, Zdravko Krivokapic, told his supporters.
""A new day in free Montenegro has started,"" added Krivokapic, a university professor.
SERBIAN LINKS
Montenegrins who identify as Serbs account for about a third of the 620,000-strong population. Most Montenegrins and Serbs share a language and the Orthodox Christian faith, and many Serbian citizens have roots and families in Montenegro. 
A pro-Serb government, if formed, might try to move the mountainous coastal nation closer to Serbia and Russia, but is not expected to take it out of NATO or abandon its bid to join the European Union. 
Krivokapic's alliance is backed by the powerful Serbian Orthodox Church, which since December has held daily protests against a law that allows the state to seize religious assets whose historical ownership cannot be proven.
Djukanovic, who faces re-election as president in 2023, and his top associates have in turn accused Serbia and Russia of using the Church and the pro-Serb opposition to undermine the independence of Montenegro and its pro-Western orientation.
Opposition leaders and democracy and human rights watchdogs have long accused Djukanovic and his party of running Montenegro as their own corrupt fiefdom with links to organized crime. The DPS denies the charges.
""Montenegro deserves to be run by a government of experts,"" said Dritan Abazovic, leader of the green United Reform Action (URA) party, which received 5.53% in Sunday's election. 
Any future government must tackle an economic downturn that started in 2019 and was aggravated by the coronavirus pandemic, which gutted tourism revenues, a key driver of the economy.

The International Monetary Fund expects Montenegro's economy to contract by nearly 9% this year.

OVER SAUDI ARABIA (Reuters) - On board a packed airliner taking U.S. and Israeli delegates to the United Arab Emirates on Monday, passengers were welcomed in Arabic as well as English and Hebrew, a gesture marking the historic first Israeli direct flight from Tel Aviv to Abu Dhabi.
The El Al Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 made aviation history by cutting straight over Saudi territory en route to the UAE capital, where Israeli and Emirati officials will hold U.S.-brokered normalization talks on Monday.
""Wishing us all salaam, peace and shalom, have a safe flight,"" the pilot, Captain Tal Becker, said on the intercom, in Arabic, English and Hebrew, using all three languages to also announce the flight number and destination.
Passengers received swag bags filled with coronavirus protection gear -- disinfectant gel and wipes -- and some donned face masks emblazoned with the Israeli and Emirati flags.
Delegates, who included President Donald Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien and his Israeli counterpart, Meir Ben-Shabbat, sat cheek by jowl with agents from the U.S. Secret Service and Israel's Shin Bet domestic security agency.
A spokesman for El Al said the plane was equipped with a C-Music anti-missile system on its rear carriage -- standard for the 737s in the carrier's fleet.
A request by Reuters journalists to film inside the cockpit went up several chains of command before being approved.
""With two countries' NSAs (national security agencies) on board, you understand the sensitivity,"" an American delegate said. 
There was also a bit of security flair to coronavirus checks mandated for journalists the weekend before the trip. 

Upon arrival for COVID-19 testing, traveling reporters were told to give a code-phrase -- ""I'm here for the 'experiment'"" -- to be fast-tracked through by a representative of the Israeli prime minister's office.

1581,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>","Explainer: How common cold viruses are being used in vaccines from Russia, China","By Allison Martell and Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) - The modified common cold viruses behind high-profile COVID-19 vaccine candidates from China's CanSino Biologics and Russia's Gamaleya Institute have been studied for decades, but are still not widely used.
The following are some details of their development, how they work and past and potential future uses:
WHEN WERE THESE VIRUSES FIRST USED IN MEDICAL RESEARCH?
The modified adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) viruses used in these vaccines were first created by Canadian researcher Dr. Frank Graham (NYSE:GHM) at a Dutch lab in the 1970s.
Graham planned to use them to study mechanisms underlying cancer, and distributed the human kidney cell line that makes them, called HEK293, to researchers all over the world.
""The cells became tremendously widespread and popular"" among researchers, said Graham, now retired in Italy. 
WHAT ARE VECTORS USED IN VACCINES AND HOW DO THEY WORK?
Vectors are materials used as mechanisms to carry genetic information into human cells. Modified viruses that cannot replicate on their own and so will not cause infection can be used as vectors to carry genes from the target virus into human cells to induce an immune response against that virus.
Ad5 vectors were tested in early gene therapy, which aims to install a missing gene or replace a mutated or damaged one. They were largely abandoned after an 18-year-old died in 1999 from an immune system overreaction after receiving a large dose during a gene therapy trial.
Some researchers believe the strong immune response that caused problems with gene therapy makes these vectors well suited to vaccines, where much lower doses are used and a protective immune response is the objective.
HAVE AD5 VECTORS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST?
At McMaster University in Canada, Graham and collaborators developed a variety of Ad5 vectors, including for a rabies vaccine used on wild raccoons in the province of Ontario. 
He and other researchers began developing an Ad5-based vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and published preclinical data. It was set aside when that pandemic ended.
In 2011, CanSino licensed an experimental tuberculosis vaccine based on Ad5 from McMaster researchers. 
The Chinese company's focus later shifted to an Ad5-based Ebola vaccine at the request of the Chinese military, according to Dr. Thomas Evans, current chief scientific officer at Vaccitech, who was involved with the tuberculosis project. The Ebola vaccine was approved for military use in 2017.
Russia's Gamaleya Research Institute, which developed Russia's coronavirus vaccine, also used the Ad5 platform to develop an Ebola vaccine, which they said has been administered to about 2,100 people.
WHAT ELSE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT USING AD5 VECTORS?
In addition to the Ad5-based COVID-19 vaccines, an inhaled version of the experimental tuberculosis vaccine is still under development at McMaster, Dr. Zhou Xing told Reuters. His team is also in the early stages of developing an inhaled COVID-19 vaccine, testing Ad5 and another vector based on a chimpanzee adenovirus.

Beijing is stepping up military activities around what it views as sovereign territory. It has never renounced the use of force to bring democratic Taiwan under its control, a message reiterated by President Xi Jinping last year, though Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic Beijing.
Xi is overseeing an impressive military modernization program, adding stealth fighters, aircraft carriers and other equipment, and the Chinese air force and navy have undertaken regular exercises or missions close to Taiwan.
In its annual report on China's military prowess delivered to parliament, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, Taiwan's Defence Ministry laid out scenarios for Chinese actions, including blockades and seizing offshore islands.
It said China's military continues to dedicate itself to strengthening live fire drills, building its strength for new types of battle and developing emerging technology and weapons.
""But on the operation of tactics and strategy toward Taiwan, it is still restricted by the natural geographic environment of the Taiwan Strait, and its landing equipment and logistics abilities are insufficient,"" it added.
""It still does not have the formal combat capability to fully assault Taiwan.""
President Tsai Ing-wen has made bolstering Taiwan's own defenses a priority, building up its domestic defense industry and buying more equipment from the United States, the island's most important arms supplier and international backer.
Tsai says she wants peace with China and will not provoke conflict, but last week voiced concern about accidental hostilities erupting due to increased regional tensions.

Taiwan's defense ministry said it was continuing to pay close attention to Chinese threats, both actual and verbal, and while it did not seek war, it was also not afraid of it.

Toshimaen amusement park, which opened in 1926 in northern Tokyo, caught the imagination of locals such as Junko and Hikari Abe, a mother and daughter who work at the park and met their partners there.
Junko, a 62-year-old park keeper who has worked intermittently at Toshimaen since the 1970s, said she had assumed it would be there till the end of her life. ""I wanted to enjoy that place together with my daughter.""
Daughter Hikari, 30, started working at the park in 2015. She had hoped to take family photos there after getting married with her fiancée, who she also met there.
""It was a spot I had taken for granted because it had been there from the time I was born, so I can't believe that it will be gone,"" she said.
Other visitors remembered family visitors, school outings, and traditional ""coming-of-age"" celebrations they had at Toshimaen, which limited the number of people who were allowed to enter over the coronavirus crisis.
""It's regrettable and sad, I can't stop wishing for a delayed closure of the park or for it to survive,"" said Akiyoshi Tomizawa, 54.
Tomizawa, who visited the park from the age of four, said he used to go swimming in the park with friends and take dates there as a teenager.
Part of the park's charm lay in its variety of attractions, which included swimming pools, eateries and roller coaster rides.
Yasuko Tagata, 56, recounted watching fireworks, which are a nighttime summer tradition in Japan, with friends from the park's swimming pools. 
""Toshimaen is a place where people grew up together,"" she said.
The new ""Harry Potter"" theme park is expected to open in 2023, and will be Japan's first.

JUBA (Reuters) - Sudan's power-sharing government signed a peace agreement with the country's five key rebel groups on Monday, a significant step towards resolving deep-rooted conflicts that raged under former leader Omar al-Bashir.
The civilian and military leaders sharing power following Bashir's overthrow in April 2019 say ending decades-long internal conflicts is a top priority of a 39-month transition.
The deal, signed in the South Sudanese capital Juba, offers rebel groups political representation and devolved powers, integration into the security forces, economic and land rights and the chance of return for displaced people.
The groups that signed include the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and Minni Minawi's Sudan Liberation Army (SLA), both of the western region of Darfur, and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) led by Malik Agar, present in South Kordofan and Blue Nile.
More than 300,000 people are estimated to have been killed and 2.5 million displaced after the conflict in Darfur spread after 2003 as government forces and mainly Arab militia moved to repress mostly non-Arab rebels. 
South Kordofan and Blue Nile remained within Sudan when South Sudan seceded in 2011 and communities there complain of marginalisation by the government in Khartoum.

A three-member bench of the Supreme Court said that lawyer Prashant Bhushan must pay the fine by Sept. 15, failing which he could be imprisoned for three months and barred from practice for three years.
The case sparked a debate around free speech and the judiciary's openness to criticism, with thousands of lawyers backing Bhushan and arguing that the court was being too harsh.
""Freedom of expression is there but rights of others should also be respected,"" the court said while imposing the fine on Bhushan.
Bhushan and his lawyers were not immediately available for comment.
In June, Bhushan posted a photograph that he said showed Chief Justice S.A. Bobde astride a Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) motorcycle, saying he was riding a 5 million rupee ($67,000) bike without a mask or a helmet while citizens were being denied justice as the court was in lockdown.
Bobde has not commented publicly on the photograph.
In another post on Twitter the same month, Bhushan said that when historians looked at how democracy had been destroyed in India in the past six years, they would note the role of the Supreme Court and the past four top justices.
Twitter blocked both of the posts.
In an 108-page order holding him guilty of criminal contempt earlier in August, the court had said the first post was ""patently false"".
The same order said that the second had the ""effect of destabilizing the very foundation of this important pillar of the Indian democracy"", referring to the judiciary.
The court then asked Bhushan, who has championed public interest litigation, to issue an ""unconditional apology"", which he declined to do, leading to the sentence on Monday.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian troops foiled an attempt by Chinese troops to encroach over the disputed and ill-defined border in the western Himalayas, the Indian army said on Monday, in a fresh flare-up between the two nuclear-armed countries.
Pre-emptive action by the Indian troops was enough to deter the Chinese troops, and the confrontation did not escalate into a clash between the two sides, an Indian military official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters.
China rejected any breach of the border by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops, but tensions between the two armies in the freezing snow deserts of the Ladakh region have been running high for several months. 
The latest incident occurred on Saturday night on the shores of Pangong Tso lake, where the two sides have been locked in a faceoff since April, the Indian army said. 
In June, 20 Indian soldiers were killed during a clash in the nearby Galwan valley, in what was the most serious military clash between the two Asian giants in more than half a century, after which both sides had agreed to pull back.
""On the night of 29/30 August 2020, PLA troops violated the previous consensus arrived at during military and diplomatic engagements during the ongoing standoff in Eastern Ladakh and carried out provocative military movements to change the status quo,"" the Indian army spokesman Colonel Aman Anand said in a statement.
The statement said Indian soldiers foiled the Chinese bid to ""unilaterally change facts on the ground."" There was no word of casualties, or details of how any incursion was thwarted.
The clash in the Galwan valley in June had involved hand-to-hand fighting, as both sides observed a protocol to refrain from using firearms on the disputed border.
China's Foreign Ministry dismissed the allegations made by India.
Chinese border troops ""always strictly abide by the Line of Actual Control, and never cross the line"", spokesman Zhao Lijian told a news briefing, referring to the de facto border.
Both sides are in communication regarding the situation on the ground, he said.
In recent months, India has accused Chinese troops of stealthily crossing the border, and building defence structures. Beijing has responded with counter claims, accusing Indian frontier guards of provocative actions. 
But despite several rounds of talks after the bloody clash in the Galwan Valley, troops are facing off at other points along the border, including the northern shore of Pangong Tso lake which both claim in full. 
The latest incident is likely to stoke further anxiety in New Delhi that China is digging its heels on the border, experts say.
""India has been trying to downplay the intrusions since May in the hope that talks will lead to an resolution. But this has only encouraged China,"" Brahma Chellaney, an expert on India-China ties, said. 
SOUTHERN SHORE 
The Indian army said the latest flare-up took place along southern shore of the lake in an escalation of the conflict.Troops were mobilised to stop the Chinese from extending their control over the area in violation of an agreement to reduce tensions, a source in New Delhi said. 
""Indian troops pre-empted this PLA activity on the southern bank of Pangong Tso lake, undertook measures to strengthen our positions and thwart Chinese intentions to unilaterally change facts on ground,"" spokesman Anand said.
India and China fought a war in 1962 over their competing territorial claims, and the two Asian giants have been unable to agree a permanent border along their frontier of nearly 3,500 km (2,000 mile).

Military officials of the two countries were holding a meeting at a border point to resolve the latest crisis, the Indian army said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. military command in South Korea said on Monday it would suspend training at a range after four South Korean civilians were killed in a crash with an armoured vehicle late on Sunday.
An SUV crashed with a military armoured vehicle at about 9:30 p.m. on Sunday, on a public road about 5 km from a live-fire range used by the U.S. and South Korean militaries in Pocheon, between Seoul and the North Korean border, the fire department said in a statement.
All four people in the SUV died, while one U.S. soldier suffered light injuries and was sent to the hospital, the department said.
U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) said the vehicle belonged to the 2nd Infantry Division-ROK/U.S. Combined Division, which was the first division to include both South Korean and U.S. troops, lead by an American commander with a South Korean deputy.
""USFK offers its deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the deceased following this tragic accident, they are in our thoughts and prayers,"" the command said in a statement. 
""Out of respect to those killed and their families Eighth Army is temporarily suspending training in the area.""
The two U.S. soldiers in the armoured vehicle were ""evaluated and returned to duty"", USFK said.
Photos and video from the site showed the SUV with its front badly mangled after apparently running into the rear of the tracked armoured personnel carrier, which showed signs of lighter damage.
About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea, where the United States has maintained a military presence since the 1950-53 Korean War.
The allies are in the midst of a dispute over how much South Korea should pay toward maintaining the troops, and South Korea has been pushing for the United States to grant it the right to control all troops in the country in the event of a war.

Kevin Yeung, the city's Secretary for Education, said the resumption would be phased with grades 1, 5 and 6 resuming for secondary schools, primary schools and upper kindergartens on Sept. 23, while other grades would open on Sept. 29.
The city's government had said at the start of August that face-to-face classes would be suspended indefinitely as the Chinese special administrative region battled to control a third wave of the coronavirus. 
The reversal in policy comes with new daily cases dropping substantially to single and low double digits from triple digits a few weeks earlier. The Chinese government is also offering mass coronavirus testing for all Hong Kong residents starting this week.
Schools in the former British colony have been mostly shut since January with many having switched to online learning. The switch to online has frustrated teachers, parents and students and exacerbated the learning gap between the haves and havenots.
More than two thirds of parents, regardless of income, believe their children have difficulty learning at home, according to a February survey by the Education University of Hong Kong.
A survey by The Society for Community Organisation (SoCO) of nearly 600 low-income students shows more than 70% did not have computers and 28% had no broadband at home.

Zaev, who won a narrow election victory over nationalist rivals in July, was approved as prime minister with 62 votes in the 120-seat parliament.
The country joined NATO in March after adding the word ""North"" to its name, under an agreement with Greece, which has a province called Macedonia and had blocked its neighbour's membership in Western organisations for decades.
""Having joined NATO, we will show that we can join the EU. It is a national, decades-long strategic interest,"" Zaev told parliament, pledging to close the negotiating chapters in six years.
After narrowly defeating the nationalists in the July 15 vote, Zaev's Social Democrat bloc gained the support of parties representing Macedonia's ethnic Albanian minority to form new a governing coalition.
He said his coalition had also prepared a new set of measures to shield the people and economy from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The country of 2 million people has reported 14,330 cases of infection and 600 deaths.

Parliament dissolved in February when Zaev resigned after the EU declined to set a date for membership negotiations. A month later the EU announced talks could begin. It has set no date, but diplomats said it would likely be later this year.

Vystrcil arrived in Taipei on Sunday on a visit to promote business links with Taiwan, saying the Czech Republic would not bow to Beijing's objections. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province ineligible for state-to-state relations.
Speaking while in Germany, Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi said there would be retribution. 
""The Chinese government and Chinese people won't take a laissez-faire attitude or sit idly by, and will make him pay a heavy price for his short-sighted behaviour and political opportunism,"" China's Foreign Ministry cited Wang as saying.

""I expect that Chinese side will explain them to us. The trip has of course an impact on relations with China, but I think that this has crossed the line,"" Petricek told reporters, according to the CTK news agency.
Vystrcil said in a statement that Wang's comments were an interference in the Czech Republic's internal affairs.
""We are a free country seeking to have good relationships with all countries and I believe this will be the case in the future irrespective of the statement of the Minister. And let me repeat again – this visit is by no means meant to politically confront anyone,"" he said. 
Taiwan Economics Minister Wang Mei-hua declined direct comment on China's attack on Vystrcil, but said the two had much in common.
""The Czech Republic and Taiwan are free and democratic countries which put great store on human rights. We have the same values as the Czechs,"" she told reporters, speaking before a joint business forum with Vystrcil.
He is due to meet Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen later and will address Taiwan's parliament before leaving on Friday. 

Czech President Milos Zeman has sought closer business and political ties with China since taking office in 2013, but his efforts have been hit by failed investment plans and Czech wavering about allowing China's Huawei Technologies to play a role in developing next-generation telecoms networks.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 03:40AM ET</span>",Facial recognition and bathtime bookings: How China's universities are reopening,"By Cate Cadell and Gabriel Crossley
BEIJING (Reuters) - As COVID-19 cases in China sink to new lows, the world's largest population of university students is heading back to campus in a migration defined by lockdowns, patriotic education and cutting-edge surveillance equipment. 
The highly choreographed return comes as Chinese universities revert to in-person instruction for the fall semester after months of pandemic controls.
Some universities have strict rules governing how students eat, bathe and travel. Students in Beijing, Nanjing and Shanghai told Reuters that they must submit detailed movement reports and stay on campus.
""But they haven't yet told us the specific application process or what reasons will be considered reasonable,"" said one student at Beijing's Renmin University. 
Renmin University did not respond to a request for comment. A notice on its social media account confirmed students must apply to leave campus.
At the same time, government procurement documents show dozens of universities have purchased ""epidemic control"" surveillance systems based on facial recognition, contact tracing and temperature checks. 
There are more than 20 million university students in China, and most live on campus in shared dorm rooms, presenting a challenge for health authorities. 
On Chinese social media, students have chafed at the controls, which mirror restrictions on the wider population during the height of the outbreak in March.
Responding to the criticism last week during a media briefing, officials from China's Ministry of Education said that the measures weren't compulsory for universities, but that students should not leave campuses unless necessary.
They also said ""patriotic health campaigns"" would be key to successfully reopening universities, and said lessons in ""anti-epidemic spirit"", including the ""touching deeds"" of medical workers, were compulsory.
HI-TECH SURVEILLANCE
Procurement documents posted online in the past two months by dozens of Chinese universities give insight into campus life in the COVID era, detailing technology systems designed to bar outsiders and collect students' data.
Many systems call for dozens of cameras that can collect facial data and temperatures, as well as notification systems that require students to enter information multiple times a day. 
""All of a sudden we found dozens of cameras in our dorm building, six on each floor,"" said a student at Peking University, who asked to remain anonymous.
""It's like someone is watching you from when you wake up to when you go to sleep,"" said another Peking University student surnamed Mei, who found cameras in her dorm when she returned this month.
Peking University did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
One system at the University of Science and Technology Liaoning cost 429,000 yuan ($62,376) and uses cutting-edge facial-recognition temperature cameras that can spot people without masks, bidding documents show.
The platform compiles a daily ""body temperature report"", and stores students' historical temperatures for 30 days.
Nanchang University in Jiangxi province spent 158,000 yuan on a system that tracks and saves data on students' movements using their national ID numbers and facial recognition. 
A system at Tianjin Normal University collects details on students' families, the addresses of places they visit off campus and how they get to the university.
It can also send reminders to students and teachers, and those who don't respond can be flagged to university personnel. Students who spoke to Reuters confirmed a variety of daily reporting requirements.
SHOWER BOOKINGS
The new rules have also given rise to more mundane challenges, students said. 
Students returning to Nanjing University said they struggled to book time in the dormitory showers between disinfection rounds. 
""Many students can't wash,"" said one Nanjing student surnamed Liu, adding that some sneak in without booking.
Several students said the rules could be flouted. Liu said temperature checks at campus gates were lax, with gate guards waving their thermometers from a distance.
Others said they feared the new surveillance tech would outlast the pandemic. 
""I think there is that concern among students, but there's no option but to accept it,"" said Mei, the student at Peking University.

A video posted on Twitter by a journalist at the daily Bild showed a crowd of several dozen jeering and shouting ""Disgrace!"" as Spahn left a building in Bergisch-Gladbach on Saturday after a local campaign appearance for his Christian Democrats (CDU).
Spahn approached the crowd and gestured to indicate that he wanted to speak but then turned and went to his car when the jeering did not subside.
""Anyone who spits at & molests democratically elected politicians infringes the German constitution and makes an outsider of themselves,"" Economy Minister Peter Altmaier tweeted.
Spahn told the Rheinische Post newspaper that society would only remain united if there was a dialogue with those who opposed the coronavirus prevention measures.
""But it only works if both sides are willing to listen. When people shout, spit and insult each other, it just doesn't work.""

The U.S. Navy said the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Halsey conducted a ""routine Taiwan Strait transit"" on Sunday in accordance with international law.
""The ship's transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The U.S. Navy will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows,"" U.S. Seventh Fleet representative Reann Mommsen said.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said the destroyer had sailed in a southerly direction through the strait and was continuing to sail south.
The ship was on an ""ordinary mission"" and the situation was ""normal"", the ministry added, without giving details.
Guided-missile destroyer USS Mustin sailed through the strait on Aug. 18, in what China's military called an ""extremely dangerous"" move.
Both China and the United States have been stepping up their military activities in the region, both around Chinese-claimed Taiwan and in the disputed South China Sea.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen warned last week of the risk of accidental conflict from the rise in military activities.
China claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.
The United States is Taiwan's main arms supplier and most important backer on the international stage.

1597,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 02:40AM ET</span>","Whoever takes over, next Japan PM faces daunting challenges","By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - The successor to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is resigning because of poor health, faces a daunting list of economic, diplomatic and security issues.
Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will choose its next party president on Sept. 14, media reported.
The winner will serve out Abe's term as party leader until September 2021 and is all but assured the premiership by virtue of the LDP's majority in parliament. 
Below are main issues the new leader will confront.
ECONOMY AND CORONAVIRUS
Abe's signature ""Abenomics"" growth strategy was facing headwinds because of an export slump and a sales tax increase even before the coronavirus outbreak, highlighting the problem of lifting the economy out of decades of stagnation.
Critics said Abe's ""third arrow"" of structural reforms - the first two were hyper-easy monetary policy and government spending - was not bold enough in the face of a fast-ageing population and a rigid labour market.
Japan has not seen an explosive coronavirus outbreak but cases have been rising and the government must balance containing it and restarting the economy. The pandemic brought Japan's biggest economic slump on record and a third quarter of declines knocked real gross domestic product growth to decade-low levels, wiping out the benefits of “Abenomics”.
Policymakers are short of ammunition with a big public debt limiting new government spending and the Bank of Japan running out of options to hit its elusive 2% inflation target.
Japan is also struggling with a rock-bottom birthrate, shrinking labour force and low global ranking on women's empowerment.
DIPLOMACY
Japan's ties with China had improved ahead of a planned visit by President Xi Jinping, but the trip was postponed because of the coronavirus. Some LDP members want the visit cancelled over China's clampdown on Hong Kong and its push to assert claims in the East China Sea.
China is locked in a confrontation with the United States over rights, trade and security, and Washington may press Tokyo to take sides. But while Japan shares U.S. concerns about China, the Asian neighbours' economies are deeply intertwined so the next leader must balance security and economic priorities.
Abe had forged close ties with President Donald Trump so the next leader will be starting afresh no matter who wins the U.S. election.
Pressure on Japan from its main security ally to take on a greater share of the burden of its defence and pay more to host U.S. troops is unlikely to ease.
Japan's ties with U.S. ally South Korea are frigid due to disputes over Koreans forced to work for wartime Japanese firms and ""comfort women"", a euphemism for those pushed into Japan's military brothels, and the feud has spilled over into security and trade.
SECURITY, CONSTITUTION
The government has begun a review of its National Security Strategy following a June decision to scrap a plan to deploy the U.S.-made Aegis Ashore ground-based missile defence system at two sites.
An LDP committee wants the government to consider a strike capability to halt ballistic missiles within enemy territory, a controversial issue for a country that renounced the right to wage war after its World War Two defeat. The proposal is also likely to anger China and Russia, which could fall within range of any new strike weapons.
Abe engineered a historic policy shift by reinterpreting the pacifist constitution, passing laws to end a ban on exercising the right of collective self-defence, or defending a friendly country under attack.
But he failed to achieve his goal of revising the post-war, U.S.-drafted charter's pacifist Article 9. Amending that is divisive and the new leader must decide if it's a priority.
PUBLIC OPINION, GENERAL ELECTION
Abe's successor is likely to lead the LDP in a general election that must be held by October 2021 and could come sooner.
The weakness of fragmented opposition parties helped Abe hold power by leading the LDP-led ruling bloc to repeated election victories, and the LDP is expected to hold a majority in the next election.
But whether it can keep its nearly two-thirds majority in the lower house is a question and will likely hinge on the coronavirus, the economy and the new leader's image.

If the LDP does badly, it may choose a new leader, reviving revolving-door premierships that plagued Japan before Abe's nearly eight-year rule.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 02:26AM ET</span>",Japan's ruling party to hold September 14 leadership vote; four possible candidates for PM,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party plans to hold a leadership vote on Sept. 14 to replace Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is stepping down due to ill health, local media reported on Monday.
The new party leader will become the country's next prime minister, due to the party's parliamentary majority, with four possible candidates vying for the position.
Abe, Japan's longest-serving premier, told U.S. President Donald Trump earlier on Monday that the strengthening of their two nations' alliance would be maintained even after he leaves office, a Japanese government spokesman said.
But Abe's successor will face a daunting list of economic, diplomatic and security issues, ranging from a stagnant economy hit by the coronavirus pandemic to China-U.S. tensions.
In the race to succeed Abe as the next prime minister, former Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba is the most popular choice among the public, media opinion polls showed.
But Ishiba, a vocal Abe critic, could face an uphill battle if he does declare his candidacy, with local media reporting Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga was set to receive the backing of several major factions within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Ishiba has about 34% of the public's support, more than double the 14% for Suga, the second-most popular choice, a weekend Kyodo News survey showed.
A Nikkei/TV Tokyo poll showed Ishiba with 28% support, followed by current Defence Minister Taro Kono with 15%. Suga came in fourth place with 11%, the poll showed.
The surveys highlight a split between public opinion and internal LDP politics.
Suga - a longtime lieutenant of Abe's in a key supporting role - will join the race to replace his boss with support expected from the faction led by LDP Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai and other major factions, putting him in a favourable position.
Suga declined to comment on Monday when asked about the LDP leadership race at his regular news conference as the government's top spokesman.
Ishiba - who unsuccessfully challenged the out-going premier in the last LDP leadership race in 2018 and is considered less popular within the party - has yet to declare whether he will run.
LDP policy chief Fumio Kishida, who has announced his intention to stand, came in last place in both of the public opinion surveys.
Kishida voiced caution on Monday over the idea of cutting the sales tax rate to help the economy weather the hit from the coronavirus pandemic.
Brad Glosserman, deputy director of the Center for Rule-Making Strategies at Tama University, said Suga was the safe bet in terms of internal LDP dynamics, but might not be ideal come election time. A general election must be held by late October 2021.
""He doesn't seem to have either the charisma or the vision to push Japan in a new direction. He seems to be the eternal Number Two - he delivers on promises made by his boss,"" said Glosserman.
Abe announced on Friday he was resigning because of poor health, his long-running battle with ulcerative colitis ending his tenure as Japan's longest-serving prime minister. 
Japan does not elect its leader by direct popular vote. Under the country's parliamentary political system, lawmakers elect a prime minister.
That means the LDP president is virtually guaranteed of being prime minister because of the party's majority in the lower house of parliament.

The LDP is set to hold on Tuesday a party meeting where it can formally adopt the Sept. 14 date for the leadership election, broadcaster FNN said, adding that the vote would be held at a Tokyo hotel instead of its party headquarters to reduce the risk of coronavirus infection.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 02:21AM ET</span>","Locked out by COVID, refugees' lives on hold","By Edward McAllister
DAKAR (Reuters) - When Michelle Alfaro left her office at the United Nations in Geneva on March 13, her job finding homes for the world's most vulnerable refugees was under control.
Four days later, the new coronavirus had knocked it into chaos. Governments across the world announced border closures, lockdowns and flight cancellations. The United Nations was forced to suspend the programme.
""Everything collapsed that week,"" said Alfaro, who manages resettlements for the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR. 
Millions of people have been thrown into limbo by the new coronavirus. Those Alfaro works with had been promised escape from war, violence, conflict or persecution. After submitting to a review process that can take years, and winning a chance to make new lives in countries such as the United States and Canada, thousands suddenly learned - often by phone - their flights would no longer take off.
Ubah Mohamed was one of them. A 23-year-old Somalian, she ran away from her husband after he tried to force her to join the Islamist group al Shabaab, militants who would later kill her father. She was due to fly to the United Kingdom on March 24.
""I didn't know where I was going,"" she said of her five-year ordeal as a refugee. ""I was just going. I had no control.""
In the first half of 2020, refugee resettlements fell 69% from 2019 levels to just over 10,000, U.N. data show. The programme resumed in June, but at a much slower pace. 
The pandemic has hit as attitudes to immigrants have been hardening, loosening another thread in increasingly frayed international efforts to maintain global solidarity.
Nationalism, fear of infection, economic worries and ageing voters' resistance to change are undermining a long-established post-war consensus that people at risk of persecution, abuse or violence deserve to be sheltered. 
The British government this month asked the armed forces to help deal with a rise in the number of boats carrying migrants from France. In Greece, the government has rebuffed thousands of migrants from Turkey this year and stiffened patrols to stop refugees arriving by boat. The European Union has pumped billions of dollars into African states in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants to its southern shores.
The United States rehouses the largest share of refugees in the programme, which in recent years has accounted for the majority of U.S. refugee intake. Arrivals under the programme have more than halved under President Donald Trump, who came to power in 2017 on an anti-immigration platform and is running for re-election promising more of the same. America accepted one-third of the refugees resettled by the United Nations last year, but is cutting its intake.
The United States stopped taking refugees from March 19 until July 29 because of travel restrictions, a State Department spokesperson told Reuters. As a result, the country resettled fewer than 3,000 people under the U.N. programme in the first half of 2020, compared with over 21,000 during the whole of last year, the data show. 
Even before COVID-19, the United Nations says it struggled to raise funds and find new homes for the 1.4 million people it estimates need immediate help. 
""It has been an especially difficult year for refugees,"" said Alfaro, the resettlement officer. ""Every single resettlement country we have has been affected - no one is left unscathed.""
NO CONTROL
Mohamed, the 23-year-old Somalian, is stranded 2,000 miles south of Geneva in a refugee camp on a sandy plain outside Niger's capital Niamey. The mother of two, who shelters in a small tent-like structure in the U.N.'s Hamdallaye camp, was told by UNHCR officials just days before leaving that her flight was off.
""I was so excited to go,"" she said in a phone interview with Reuters. ""I live in a tent. If I can live in a home in a safe place, I will be satisfied.""
Her journey started in 2015, on a bus to the coastal city of Bosaso, after her father told her the safest thing she could do would be to get away from her husband and leave her children behind. 
A man offered her a place on a boat across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen - a common route for Somalians seeking refuge from conflict over the decades. By accepting, she unwittingly entered a network of migrant smugglers that would rob, rape and sell her from Yemen to Sudan to Libya.
Just days into her journey, she said she called her father to let him know where she was. Her step-mother answered the phone and told her the militants had killed him for helping her escape. 
In southern Libya, a smuggler raped her repeatedly. She miscarried his child in the spring of 2016. He discarded her and she continued north.
Later that year, at a halfway house for migrants in northern Libya, another smuggler beat her when she told him she did not have enough money for her travel.
Crossing the Sahara Desert from Sudan to Libya in an open-back pick-up truck in 2016, sipping water that tasted of petrol, her mind was flooded with thoughts of her children. She thinks they are with family. 
""I don't know where they are,"" she said. ""I am a mother, and I cannot be with them. All I can do is cry."" 
She married a fellow Somalian refugee in northern Libya in 2017. The smugglers' network funneled them towards Europe. They were separated just before she boarded an overcrowded dinghy which broke down and drifted on the Mediterranean for days.
There, the Libyan Coast Guard picked her up and handed her over to the U.N. refugee agency and she was reunited with her husband at a migrant detention centre a few days later. The U.N. flew them from Tripoli to Niamey and moved them into the camp in March 2019, where the resettlement assessment began. 
""I wanted to forget everything I had been through,"" she said. 
She said she has not received any information about when she will leave for the United Kingdom. It has suspended resettlements indefinitely because of flight restrictions and limits to its own visa application services during the pandemic, a Home Office spokeswoman told Reuters. It wants to be sure that resuming arrivals does not pose a public health risk.
""We are not in a position to resume arrivals in the immediate short term,"" she said. 
The United Nations said it does not comment on specific cases. 
CAJOLING COUNTRIES
Alfaro's employer, UNHCR, has been resettling refugees since the 1950s when it found new homes for 170,000 who escaped the Hungarian Revolution. Over the past 25 years, it says it has helped one million people out of the world's trouble spots including Syria, Iraq, Sudan and Myanmar. Dozens of countries receive refugees under the programme.
The UNHCR identifies those most in need through interviews and refers them to a receiving country, which conducts its own assessments. Another U.N. agency, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), makes the travel arrangements.
When COVID-19 hit, receiving countries evacuated embassy staff, so U.N. officials could no longer reach them to help organise departures or process new referrals. Several countries told the United Nations they were suspending all or part of their refugee intake. 
Local officials, confined by lockdowns, have been unavailable to stamp exit visas. House-bound U.N. field staff can't interview applicants. Officials from receiving countries have been unable to reach applicants for face-to-face interviews because of travel restrictions. 
In March, Alfaro's days disappeared on long conference calls and briefings as she tried to persuade governments to keep their borders open to emergency cases, and to accept online interviews for new referrals.
A few hundred critical cases were resettled during the suspension, Alfaro said; some countries have agreed to video interviews. But others, including the United States, still require them to be conducted in person. The United States has taken in refugees at a far slower pace than pre-COVID levels, the State Department spokesperson said: There are still ""few or no flights available"" from many of the countries who send them. 
Staff at the IOM have been scouring airline booking systems for ways to get emergency cases moving, even during the suspension. Flights would appear and then be cancelled.
In all, the agency cancelled 11,000 plane tickets because of the pandemic, said Rana Jaber, its head of resettlements, who worked with refugees in Iraq from 2015 to 2017. 
""I felt like I was in Iraq again,"" she said. ""My lord, my brains were fried.""
SPACES LOST
Because of the slowdown in interviews, global referrals dropped from 40,000 to 20,000 in the first half of the year, the U.N. data show. This means a backlog of tens of thousands of people is building, and there's a risk these places will be lost indefinitely.
Now refugees are falling victim to COVID-19. In Iraq, Alfaro said the UNHCR is looking after a ""significant number"" of refugees with urgent medical needs who are unable to be resettled because of travel restrictions. At least two people have died of COVID-19 while awaiting the move.
In Uganda, COVID-19 has spread through slums of the capital Kampala where many who await resettlement are housed in crowded accommodations with no running water or electricity, aid workers said.
The U.N. has resettled about 2,100 refugees since resuming flights - way below the average pace of previous years, said the IOM's Jaber. Cancellations continue.
""Some are opening up, but not everyone is back online - maybe not until next year,"" said Alfaro. ""We don't know how many spaces we're going to lose.""
There have been bright spots. An Eritrean couple with a young baby were the first refugees to be resettled to Europe since flights were stopped in March, UNHCR said on Twitter on Aug. 14.
Just hours after a vast explosion devastated much of Lebanon's capital Beirut on Aug. 4, IOM staff were back at work. The ancient city holds hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled Syria's civil war.
That night, IOM got 30 of them on a flight out, said IOM's Jaber. In total, 61 were relocated that week. 

""There are challenges still,"" she said. ""We are back, it is slower, (but) it is working.""

The Pacific nation of 5 million people had appeared to have succeeded in halting community transmission of COVID-19, but a fresh outbreak in Auckland prompted the government to place the city back in lockdown earlier this month.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern scaled back the restrictions in Auckland on Sunday, but made masks compulsory on public transport.
Ardern said on Monday that she was confident the new measure would be taken up across New Zealand, adding that “a bit of smiling with the eyes behind the mask” and kindness to Aucklanders in particular, would help get the country through the latest outbreak.
""We have a plan that we know will work. We just need everyone's compliance and help. If everyone sticks to those guidelines and rules, coupled together with all the public health measures that we have, we can make this work,"" Ardern, wearing a mask herself, told reporters in Auckland.
Students in Auckland returned to school after many weeks of disruptions. 
""To me it's so good for them to go back to school. Online work, online school is alright but it's still not good enough for them. So it's good to get out of the house,"" said one parent.
Limits on public gatherings in Auckland remain and the rest of the country remains in alert level 2, which means social distancing norms must be followed.
New Zealand announced 9 new coronavirus cases on Monday, five of which were in the community and were traced to the known Auckland cluster.

New Zealand has recorded 1,387 total confirmed cases of COVID-19 so far, and 22 deaths.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Private tuition centres shut for the first time and traffic was lighter in South Korea's capital on Monday, the first working day of tighter social-distancing rules designed to halt a second wave of coronavirus outbreaks. 
South Korea took the unprecedented step on Friday to restrict the operation of restaurants, coffee shops and so-called cram schools in the Seoul metropolitan area, with churches, nightclubs and most public schools having already been closed.
The decision came after earlier restrictions on movement failed to prevent a second wave of coronavirus infections from erupting at churches, offices, nursing homes and medical facilities.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 238 new cases as of midnight Sunday, mostly from Seoul and surrounding regions, the 18th consecutive day of triple-digit rises in daily infections. 
Less cars and people were on the streets of Seoul during the morning rush hours as more companies encouraged employees to work from home. 
""I began working from home today as the company allowed it for the first time because the number of cases continued to surge,"" said Oh Yun-mi, 36, who works at a manufacturing company. 
A 40-year-old office worker who only gave his surname Cho said his usual commuting time was cut by about a third. 
Private after-school tuition academies, which operated as usual in March during South Korea's first wave of coronavirus infections, were shuttered. There are 25,000 cram schools in Seoul and nationally three out of four children - from grade 1 to grade 12 - attended such classes.
The government has cut staffing at public offices, while many corporations, including tech giants Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), LG (KS:066570) and SK Hynix (KS:000660), have expanded or reinstated work-from-home policies. 
Onsite dining at restaurants, pubs and bakeries in the Seoul area are banned after 9 p.m. until Sunday, while coffeehouse chains are restricted to takeout and delivery.

South Korea has reported total infections of 19,947 and 324 deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California fire officials on Sunday reported significant headway battling the two largest of dozens of lightning-sparked blazes raging in and around the greater San Francisco Bay area since mid-August, though 60,000 people remained under evacuation.
As of Sunday firefighters had managed to carve containment lines around 56% of the perimeter of a colossal wildfire that has burned more than 375,000 acres across five counties north of the bay, including a swath of the Napa and Sonoma valley wine country region.
That marked a major gain from 41% containment listed a day earlier for the blaze, dubbed the LNU Lightning Complex fire, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire).
Containment of a slightly larger fire called the SCU Lightning Complex, which has charred more than 377,000 acres in four counties east and south of the bay, grew to 50% on Sunday, up from 40% on Saturday, CalFire said.
Those two blazes together - which rank as the second- and third-largest wildfires on record in California - account for half of total acreage set ablaze during the past two weeks in a series of catastrophic lightning storms.
Firefighters, helped by cooler weather after a record-breaking heat wave abated, have gained ground elsewhere across the state, as well.
""We definitely have increased containment on all of the major fires, evacuations are being lifted and weather conditions are more favorable,"" CalFire spokeswoman Christine McMorrow told Reuters by phone. ""We are definitely making progress.""
Nearly 14,00 lightning strikes, mostly in central and northern California, have ignited hundreds of individual fires since Aug. 15, many of which merged into bigger conflagrations. Those fires have collectively charred more than 1.42 million acres - a landscape larger than the state of Delaware, according to CalFire.
Seven fatalities have been confirmed, and nearly 2,500 homes and other structures have been reduced to ruin. Smoke from the fires also badly degraded air quality throughout the region, adding to health hazards already posed by the coronavirus pandemic.
While CalFire said more than 60,000 residents remained displaced throughout the fire zone as of Sunday morning, McMorrow said ""quite a few"" evacuation orders and warnings were being lifted. 
Meteorologists said the recent spate of dry lightning, the heaviest seen in California in more than a decade, was linked to the same atmospheric high-pressure system that caused a lengthy heat wave, which in turn further desiccated dense, fire-prone vegetation across the state.
Scientists point to lengthy droughts and longer-than-normal stretches of extreme heat as evidence of climate change that has steadily intensified and prolonged wildfire season in California and across the Western United States in recent years.

Climatologist Zach Zobel said California is on track to overtake the nearly 2 million acres burned in 2018, when the state suffered its deadliest wildfire in history, as well as the most acreage burned on record gong back to 1987.

""He wants President Trump to rest assured because the policy of bolstering the Japan-U.S. alliance will remain unchanged,"" Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Akihiro Nishimura said.
Nishimura was speaking to reporters after a 30-minute telephone call between Abe and Trump, early on Monday in Japan. Trump called Abe the ""greatest prime minister in Japan's history"", according to a White House spokesman. 
Abe told Trump that Japan would like to cooperate closely with the United States as it draws up a new missile defence strategy, Nishimura said. 
Japan in July took a step towards acquiring weapons that can strike North Korea, after a ruling party committee approved proposals to consider acquiring strike capability to halt ballistic missile attacks.
White House spokesman Judd Deere (NYSE:DE) said in a statement Trump told Abe he had done a ""fantastic job"" and that the relationship between their two countries was stronger than it has ever been. 
""The president called Prime Minister Abe the greatest prime minister in Japan's history,"" Deere said.

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party will vote on Sept. 14 for a new leader to succeed Abe, Jiji news agency reported.

Australia’s winemakers have been hit by a second Chinese government probe, as trade tensions between the countries escalate.
China has started an anti-subsidy investigation into wines in containers holding two liters or less from Australia, according to a statement on the Ministry of Commerce website. The announcement comes less than two weeks after China, the biggest international buyer of Australian wine, said it had started an anti-dumping probe into the same product.
The investigation is the latest blow to the Australian industry, which has been hit by slower demand amid global Covid-19 lockdowns, drought-affected vintages, as well as smoke taint and damage from the country’s unprecedented bushfire season last summer.
Industry group Australian Grape & Wine said China had previously flagged the potential for an anti-subsidy investigation and the sector was well placed to respond. It would fully cooperate through the investigation process.
Ties between the two trading partners have increasingly frayed in recent years. In addition to banning Huawei Technologies Co. from participating in Australia’s 5G network, Australia’s push for an independent inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak sparked a Chinese backlash.
China halted some beef imports earlier this year, with a fifth meatworks banned from shipping product there just last week.
It also put tariffs of more than 80% on Australia’s barley exports in May after the conclusion of earlier anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probes. In addition, the Chinese ambassador to Canberra said in April that Chinese consumers might choose to boycott the nation’s exports because of strained relations, a comment that was seen as a threat in Australia.
The wine subsidy probe is due to end by Aug. 31, 2021 and can be extended to Feb. 28, 2022, according to the statement.

The ""Eat out to Help Out"" initiative was designed to boost a hospitality sector that has been especially hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. It offered 50% off the price of meals on the first three days of the week at participating restaurants, up to a maximum of 10 pounds ($13) - with the government making up the difference.
So popular has it been that more than 64 million meals had been eaten under the scheme up to Aug. 27, according to the Open Table online booking website.
""The scheme reminded us why we as a nation love dining out and I urge diners to maintain the momentum to help continue our economic recovery,"" Sunak said in a statement.
""I want to say thank you to the diners who have fallen back in love with their local, to the managers who have spent weeks ensuring their restaurants were safe and to the chefs, waiters and waitresses across the country who have worked tirelessly, sometimes with more customers than they’ve ever had before – all helping to protect 1.8 million jobs in the hospitality sector.""
Open Table figures showed the average number of seated diners between Monday and Wednesday this month was up 95% on last year.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a national lockdown in March and the Treasury said on Monday around 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April, with 1.4 million workers furloughed, the highest of any sector.

Several restaurant chains have already said they will continue offering the discount in September.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's ambassador to Germany Mustapha Adib is poised to be designated prime minister on Monday after winning the support of major parties to form a new government facing a crippling financial crisis and the aftermath of the Beirut port explosion.
The nomination followed contacts by French President Emmanuel Macron over the last 48 hours to press Lebanese leaders to agree on a candidate, two senior Lebanese officials said, just ahead of a visit by the French leader to Lebanon this week.
Macron has taken centre stage in international efforts to get Lebanon's fractious leaders to start addressing a financial crisis that had devastated the economy even before the Aug. 4 port blast that killed some 190 people. 
A French presidency source said Macron had been in contact by phone with the main protagonists on Saturday and Sunday. ""The president is informed of the negotiations underway in Beirut,"" the source said. Macron arrives in Beirut late on Monday.
Last week, contacts among Lebanese leaders to agree a new prime minister were deadlocked. One of the two senior Lebanese sources said Macron's role had been essential in clinching the agreement on Adib.
The previous government led by Hassan Diab quit on Aug. 10 over the port blast in which a massive amount of unsafely stored chemicals detonated.
Adib has a doctorate in law and political science and previously served as an adviser to Najib Mikati, a former prime minister. He has served as ambassador to Germany since 2013.
The post of prime minister must go to a Sunni Muslim in Lebanon's sectarian system. Adib's candidacy won vital political backing on Sunday from former prime ministers including Saad al-Hariri, who heads the biggest Sunni party, the Future Movement.
President Michel Aoun, a Maronite Christian, is due to meet parliamentary blocs on Monday in the official consultations to designate the new premier. He is required to nominate the candidate with biggest level of support among MPs.
Lebanon's dominant Shi'ite parties, Hezbollah and the Amal Movement led by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, will both name Adib at the consultations, a senior Shi'ite source said.
The Christian Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), a political ally of Hezbollah which was founded by Aoun and is led today by his son-in-law Gebran Bassil, will do the same, Bassil told Reuters. 
Once designated, the process of forming a new government will get underway. Until a new administration is agreed, the Diab government continues in a caretaker capacity.
Lebanon's financial crisis has sunk the currency by as much as 80% since October, locked savers out their deposits in a paralysed banking system and fuelled poverty and unemployment.
Lebanon launched talks with the International Monetary Fund in May, after defaulting on its huge debt, aiming to secure financial support but these have stalled amid divisions on the Lebanese side over the scale of losses in the financial system.

Another five migrants were injured and taken to hospitals, health authorities in the Italian port city of Crotone said, adding that two of them were in a serious condition.
Two finance police officers were hurt as they tried to steer the migrant ship to safety, commander Emilio Fiora was reported as saying by AdnKronos news agency. He said the ship's engine caught fire and there was an explosion.
Fiora added that searches were going on to make sure that everyone had been rescued.
Italy used to be a major route into Europe for hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and other migrants, but numbers fell sharply after a crackdown in Libya on smugglers. 
However, there has been a pick-up in 2020 although Rome has closed its ports to migrant boats, saying it is impossible to help migrants due to the coronavirus crisis.

The incident occurred at the end of a peaceful march on Saturday when a group of people climbed the monument and pulled down the statue, causing the head to fly off, according to video posted on social media.
Calls to defund the police have been growing across the United States and Canada, after a spate of violent incidents involving police. The death of George Floyd, a Black man, while in the custody of Minneapolis police in May sparked global protests about racial inequality and police brutality, and renewed pledges from some to fight racism.
In June, a video showing a forceful arrest of a Canadian indigenous leader by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police raised questions about the use of force by the police. 
The statue of Macdonald has been the site of repeated acts of graffiti in recent years, and it has often been covered in red paint.
Saturday's incident drew quick condemnation from political leaders.
""Whatever one might think of John A. Macdonald, destroying a monument in this way is unacceptable,"" Quebec Premier François Legault said in a tweet. ""We must fight racism, but destroying parts of our history is not the solution.""

1613,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 30, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",Race to Replace Abe Takes Shape as Hopefuls Express Interest,"(Bloomberg) -- The race to replace Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is starting to take shape as candidates declare their interest to their inner circles just days after the leader said he’s resigning due to health reasons.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a senior ruling party leader he intends to seek the role of president in the Liberal Democratic Party, Kyodo News reported on Sunday, citing a source it didn’t identify. The LDP has run the country for most of the last 65 years, and the party leader is almost assured of serving as prime minister.
Former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba plans to declare his intention on Monday to run for the election, Sankei newspaper reported on Friday, without saying where it got the information. Other names mentioned in local media on Sunday included Defense Minister Taro Kono and former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida.
Abe, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, said he would stay on until LDP leaders hold an internal vote to pick a successor. Toshihiro Nikai, the LDP’s secretary-general, said leaders will listen to opinions before deciding on an election method.
The party plans to lay out details on the vote at a general council meeting on Tuesday, and the leadership election may be held Sept. 15, Kyodo reported. The new premier will be picked in parliament on Sept. 17, the news agency said.
Abe said on Friday that he would step down to undergo treatment for ulcerative colitis, a chronic digestive condition that also forced him to step down as premier in 2007. The resignation came as a shock even within the LDP, with Suga saying on Thursday that Abe should be able to serve out the remainder of his premiership after questions of his health were raised.
Japanese stocks dropped on Friday, reflecting uncertainty over who Abe’s successor will be. The yen, a haven currency, jumped against the dollar. The cost to insure Japanese corporate debt against non-payment rose.
Suga, the top government spokesman and Abe’s right-hand man since 2012, believes his ability to manage crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic, and the role he played in spurring Japan’s economic revival should give him an edge, according to Kyodo.
Ishiba is seen as most fit to succeed Abe as LDP party leader, according to a Kyodo poll released on Sunday, with 34.3% of support among those surveyed. He has backed economic policies seen as more populist than Abe’s, and has been aligned with the premier in trying to keep ties with China on a steady path. Ishiba was the only politician to run against Abe in the last party race in 2018. Suga had 14.3%, and Kono had 13.6% support in the Kyodo poll.
Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the 39-year-old son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and a rising political star, won’t join the race but would back Kono if he does, national broadcaster NHK reported.
Abe has fought against the impact of the pandemic on the Japanese economy that contracted a record annualized 27.8% in the three months through June from the previous quarter. He launched a stimulus package including cash handouts to struggling households to cope with the negative economic impact. About 58% of those surveyed by Kyodo believed that Abe’s decision to step down was apt.
The Tokyo metropolitan government reported 148 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, bringing the capital’s cumulative total to 20,717. Tokyo’s daily cases increased by triple digits every day in August, with a record 472 on Aug. 1. The number of confirmed cases in the coronavirus outbreak in Japan stood at 65,625 as of Friday, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg.

Lukashenko, who turned 66 on Sunday, is struggling to contain weeks of protests and strikes since winning an Aug. 9 election his opponents say was rigged. He denies electoral fraud and has said the protests are backed from abroad.
Russian President Vladimir Putin used a birthday phone call to invite Lukashenko to visit Moscow, a sign of the Kremlin's willingness to back Lukashenko as he grapples with the unrest and the threat of new Western sanctions.
Protesters streamed into central Minsk, carrying balloons, flowers and flags, in the afternoon. Belarus had a white-red-white flag for a brief period in the early 1990s and it has become a symbol of its anti-government protests.
Passing cars honked their horns in solidarity. Some women lay down in protest in front of a cordon of helmeted security forces. 
Protesters then converged on Lukashenko's residence, which was guarded by security forces carrying shields, and water canon and prisoner vans. A column of armoured military vehicles was seen driving towards the city centre, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. 
Police made sporadic detentions throughout the day, bundling people into prisoner vans. At least 125 people were detained, Russia's RIA news agency quoted the interior ministry as saying. Some protesters resisted arrest by what appeared to be plain-clothes officers, a witness said. 
Earlier on Sunday, video footage shared by local media showed women dressed in traditional dress laying several pumpkins in front of the main government building, a folk custom intended to signal the rejection of a suitor.
One of the country's largest mobile operators, A1, said it had reduced the capacity of mobile internet bandwidth at the government's request. 
Belarus is Russia's closest ex-Soviet ally and its territory is an integral part of Moscow's European defence strategy. Nevertheless, Lukashenko is seen in Moscow as a prickly partner.
In the biggest sign yet of Russia's willingness to intervene to prop up Lukashenko, Putin said on Thursday the Kremlin had set up a ""reserve police force"" at Lukashenko's request, although it would be deployed only if necessary.
""It was agreed to hold a meeting in Moscow in the coming weeks,"" the Kremlin said in a statement after the leaders' call on Sunday. 

The European Union is gearing up to impose new sanctions on Belarus. Lukashenko, in office for 26 years, threatened on Friday to cut off European transit routes across his country in retaliation.

Police in the nation's capital were able to prevent demonstrators from entering the building, but the day saw hundreds of arrests, pockets of violence with injured police, and the forced break-up of one mass protest.
Finance minister Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democrats, the junior partner in Angela Merkel's conservative-led ruling coalition and candidate to succeed her as chancellor, said Germans must do everything possible to prevent such scenes.
""It is unacceptable that some now appear in front of the Bundestag building, the Reichstag building, the most important symbol of our democracy, the parliament, with symbols from a bad dark past, flags that have nothing to do with our modern democracy,"" Scholz told journalists at a brief news conference outside his party's headquarters in central Berlin. 
Some 3,000 far-right sympathisers and extremists were among the tens of thousands of protesters on Saturday, according to Berlin's interior minister.
Demonstrators broke through a barricade to access the steps of the Reichstag, one of Germany's most structures that was renovated with a glass dome by architect Norman Foster after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Scholz's comments were echoed by politicians including German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the chair of Merkel's Christian Democrats, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.

The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan armed group operating in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three decades, has killed more than 1,000 civilians since the start of 2019, according to United Nations figures.
The latest violence saw six Congolese soldiers wounded in clashes with the militants following the ambush near the town of Mbau, army spokesman Antony Mwalushayi said on Sunday.
""Two ADF fell on the spot. In the evening after we secured the area, we discovered another eight,"" he said, referring to the militant casualties.
Not long after the ambush, members of the same ADF group killed five civilians near Mbau, including three women, and took a few hostages, according to Mathe Esdras, head of the local youth council. Reuters could not independently verify his report.
The army launched a large offensive against the ADF late last year, sparking a violent backlash against civilians.
The insecurity has forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes and complicated Congo's response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as an Ebola epidemic that has killed more than 2,200 people.
Several attacks attributed to the ADF have also been claimed by Islamic State, although researchers and analysts say there is a lack of hard evidence linking the two groups.

The presidency has called for parliamentary consultations on Monday to choose a new prime minister after the government, which took office with the backing of Hezbollah and its allies, quit over this month's Beirut port blast.
Nasrallah's remarks suggested the group was ready to discuss more profound changes. 
""France's president in his last visit called for a new political contract ... We are open to any calm discussion for a new political contract but on the condition it take place with agreement from all Lebanese factions,"" Nasrallah said in a speech.
He said the movement supported ""reforms to the widest extent"" if there was a mechanism to agree on them.
French President Emmanuel Macron, due to visit Beirut again on Monday, has outlined reforms local politicians must make to unlock foreign aid to tackle a deep financial crisis rooted in corruption and mismanagement, including an interim government capable of enacting change and early parliamentary polls.
RIVALS AND FACTIONS
There has been little progress in agreeing on a premier so far amid political rivalries and factional jostling. Under Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system, the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim.
Hezbollah and its Shi'ite ally Amal want the return of Saad al-Hariri, seeing him as capable of galvanising foreign support. 
But this has hit resistance from several parties, including Hezbollah's ally the Maronite Christian President Michel Aoun and his son-in-law, Free Patriotic Movement leader Gebran Bassil, at loggerheads with Hariri since last year.
Hezbollah and its allies have a parliamentary majority.
The government's resignation deepened uncertainty in the country, whose political elite has been the target of public anger over an economic meltdown and the Aug. 4 blast that involved highly-explosive material stored unsafely for years.
Ministers have kept working in a caretaker capacity until a new government is agreed.

In his televised speech, Nasrallah also called on the Lebanese army to announce the results of its technical investigation into the blast that killed 190 people, injured some 6,500 and wrecked swathes of Beirut.

Police arrested the man on Aug 28, days after a first suspect was arrested in Cairo.
Seven other suspects fled the country between July 27 and July 29 after claims against them began circulating on the internet, the public prosecutor's office said on Wednesday.
Five of the seven suspects escaped to Lebanon, where security forces Aug. 28 arrested three of them after receiving a notice from the international police organization Interpol's office in Egypt, the internal security forces (ISF) said in a statement on Saturday.
Two suspects had left the country, the ISF said.
Anger at inaction over the 2014 incident at Cairo's Fairmont Hotel helped fuel a campaign against harassment and assault in which hundreds of women have shared testimonies online.
Prosecutors said they launched an investigation into the Fairmont Hotel case after legal complaints were lodged in early August. They said the suspects had been able to flee because the complaints had not been submitted earlier, and they urged victims to file complaints rather than post accusations online.
The Fairmont Hotel case was publicised on an Instagram account that had previously carried accusations against a university student from a wealthy background of raping and blackmailing multiple women.

(Reuters) - Fishermen battled on Sunday to save dozens of injured dolphins washed ashore in Mauritius where in recent days at least 40 of the animals were found dead in a lagoon near the site of an oil spill from a Japanese bulk carrier which struck a coral reef.
Yasfeer Heenaye, a fisherman near Pointe aux Feuilles on the island's eastern shore, said he had counted at least 45 dead dolphins since they were first discovered on Wednesday, and said half a dozen more dolphins were in the bay fighting for their lives.
He said he believed the animals' vision was impaired by the spilled oil, which is how they ended up on the reef where they sustained fatal injuries. 
Authorities, who put the death toll at 42, ruled out this is a possibility but said on Sunday they were still investigating the cause of death.
""The preliminary autopsy report has excluded that oil played a role, however we sent some samples of the dead dolphins to La Reunion to determine why the animals couldn't swim and their radar wasn't functioning,"" Jasvin Sok Appadu from the Fisheries Ministry said on Sunday .
So far veterinarians have examined only two of the dead dolphins, which bore signs of injury but no trace of hydrocarbons in their bodies, according to preliminary autopsy results. Autopsy results on all carcasses are expected on Monday, the official said.
Thousands of protesters peacefully demonstrated in the capital Port Louis on Saturday to demand an investigation into the oil spill and the death of the dolphins. Some called for the government to resign.
On Sunday morning Heenaye was out with seven other boats, making loud noise by hitting together metal bars in an attempt to drive the animals away from the coral reef towards the open sea. 
""If they stay inside the lagoon they will die like the others...we are pushing them to go outside the lagoon, so they wont get in touch with the oil,"" he said. 
The full impact of the spill is still unfolding, scientists say. The Mauritius Marine Conservation Society said 15 kilometers of coastline have been affected by the spill and that it is moving towards the Blue Bay Marine park, home to 38 types of coral and 78 species of fish.

The wildlife at risk include the critically endangered Pink Pigeon, endemic to the island, the seagrasses, clownfish and mangrove forests, whose roots serve as nurseries for fish.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - About 1,200 Thai royalists gathered on Sunday to support the monarchy after almost daily student-led, anti-government protests calling for change, with some seeking reforms of the powerful institution.
Waving national flags and holding pictures of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the group of mostly older people, called ""Thai Pakdee"" (Loyal Thai) many in yellow and some in white, urged Thais to protect the monarchy and the country.
Rallying in an indoor sports stadium in the capital Bangkok, some had ""We Love The King"" written on their bandannas while others held placards with messages such as ""Save the Nation"", ""Don't Bully Loyalists"" and ""Topple the institution - over my dead body"".
""The point of our group is to protect the monarchy with knowledge and facts,"" said prominent right-wing politician Warong Dechgitvigrom, who launched the group this month as he felt the monarchy was under attack.
""We insist that the country's conflicts stem from politicians,"" he told reporters. ""The monarchy institution has no part in governing the country. The institution is the morale support that connects the people together.""
Demonstrator Somporn Sooklert, 63, said, ""I want the new generation to appreciate the country, religion and monarchy as much as they can because without any one of them, the country will not be able to survive"".
The gathering follows over a month of protests led by students calling for the ouster of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former coup leader, a new constitution and fresh election, with some drawing more than 10,000 protesters.
Some of those demonstrators have openly called for reforms of the monarchy, a taboo topic in a country with laws that punish perceived royal insults with up to 15 years in prison.
Thai Pakdee has also set three demands: No dissolution of parliament, maximum legal action against anyone who seeks to topple the monarchy, with no change to the constitution except via the ""proper channel"".
Prayuth warned last week that the country could be ""engulfed in flames"" if divisions persist.

Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah last fought a war in 2006, and tensions on the Israel-Lebanon border have been running high after the Shi'ite movement said one of its members was killed in an apparent Israeli air strike in July in Syria.
""Israel needs to understand that when they kill one of our mujahideen, we will kill one of their soldiers. This is the equation,"" Nasrallah said in a televised speech.
""We will not engage in exchanges of fire ... because this is what Israel wants,"" he said. ""They know that we are not looking for a publicity achievement, but that we are looking for soldiers to kill and they are hiding them like rats.""
Earlier this week the Israeli military struck what it said were Hezbollah posts after shots were fired at troops in Israel, which Nasrallah on Sunday denied. Last month, Israel said the group carried out an infiltration attempt, a charge it denied.
No casualties were reported on either side in the incidents.
Nasrallah said Hezbollah would not be drawn into clashes that would ""waste the blood of our martyrs and our equation"".
After two Hezbollah members were killed in Damascus in 2019, Nasrallah vowed the group would respond if Israel killed any more Hezbollah fighters inside Syria, where they deployed as part of Iranian-backed efforts to support President Bashar al-Assad in a war that spiralled out of 2011 anti-government protests.
Israel has stepped up strikes on Syria in recent months in what Western intelligence sources say is a shadow war, approved by Washington, that has undermined Iran’s military power in the region without triggering a major increase in hostilities.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel hopes to hold a signing ceremony in Washington for its normalisation deal with the United Arab Emirates by mid-September, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet said on Sunday.
The date for such an event could be decided by senior aides to Netanyahu and to U.S. President Donald Trump when those officials fly to Abu Dhabi on Monday for talks, Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister Ofir Akunis told public broadcaster Kan.
Top Trump adviser Jared Kushner and the other U.S. delegates were due in Israel on Sunday to prepare for the UAE mission. 
""This (normalisation) agreement is expected to be signed in the month of September in the city of Washington,"" Akunis said. ""That is meant to be one of the outcomes of the talks in the next 24 hours in the Emirates - setting a date for the signing.""
Akunis added that the Netanyahu government hopes the ceremony will take place ""before our Rosh Hashanah"" or Jewish new year, which is on Sept. 18. 
Israel and the UAE announced on Aug. 13 that they would normalise diplomatic relations in a deal brokered by Trump. The agreement reshapes the Middle East order, from the Palestinian issue to relations with Iran.
On Saturday, the Gulf power announced it was scrapping its economic boycott against Israel, allowing trade and financial agreements between the countries.
Officials from the two countries have said they are looking at cooperation in defence, medicine, agriculture, tourism and technology. 
""We are talking about commercial deals worth $500 million in the initial stages, and this will keep rising all the time,"" Akunis said. 
Such bilateral deals, he said, will give rise to ""trilateral investments, in other words, in additional projects with other countries in the region"". He did not name these countries. 
The U.S. and Israeli delegations are due to travel together to Abu Dhabi on an  El Al  Israel Airlines Ltd (TA:ELAL) plane, Israel's first direct flight between Tel Aviv and the UAE capital. 

El Al released pictures of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-900 jet that will take the delegates. The word ""peace"" in English, Hebrew and Arabic is inscribed on the exterior above the cockpit windows for the occasion.

From Tuesday, a 60-strong mainland team is due to conduct tests in the first direct help from China's health officials for the semi-autonomous city as it battles the pandemic.
But the effort comes at a sensitive time for the former British colony, as anxiety runs high over what many of its 7.5 million residents see as Beijing's efforts to rein in their freedoms, in particular a national security law imposed in June.
The government has also postponed September's legislative elections by a year, citing risks to public health and dealing a blow to the pro-democracy opposition camp, which had hoped for a historic majority win after overwhelming success in lower-level elections last year.
The Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, formed during last year's pro-democracy protests with 20,000 members, said universal testing was not an efficient use of resources and urged focused tests instead.
""It is clear to see that the government has one and only one goal ... to use the pandemic to achieve their own political aims,"" its leader Winnie Yu told a joint news conference with activists.
""They shall do whatever they can to please the central government of China, even if it means placing politics above all things else.""
Wong said a full closure of the border would be a better measure than the government plan, adding, ""It’s like having a pregnancy test without having birth control.""
The city's Beijing-backed chief executive, Carrie Lam, has hit back at critics of the initiative, dismissing their attempt to ""smear the central government"".
Chinese state media have denounced the critics as ungrateful, while China’s Hong Kong Liaison Office in the financial hub has said in a statement it was ""shocking"" that people could question the plan.
It comes at a time when new daily infections have fallen substantially, to figures in the single digits or low double digits, from three digits during a surge a few weeks ago. The tally rose to 4,801 with 15 more cases reported on Sunday. 
Police also dispersed a protest by dozens of pro-democracy activists in a shopping mall roughly a year since some of the most violent clashes in a metro station in train carriages, citing a virus precaution limiting gatherings to two.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government has come under fire over its moves to restart education, especially after a row over exam results for school students and a failed attempt to bring all pupils back to their classes earlier this year.
Johnson has been calling on Britons to return to something more akin to normality after the coronavirus lockdown, calling on workers to return to offices to help the economy recover from a 20% contraction in the April-June period.
But the University and College Union (UCU) said it was too early to send students back to universities, warning they could be blamed if cases of COVID-19 increased.
""Moving a million plus students around the country is a recipe for disaster and risks leaving ill-prepared universities as the care homes of a second wave,"" UCU general secretary Jo Grady said in a statement.
""It is time for the government to finally take some decisive and responsible action in this crisis and tell universities to abandon plans for face-to-face teaching,"" she said, urging the government to move all teaching online for the first term.
Stephen Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury (finance ministry), said he did not agree with the argument. ""I think universities like the rest of the economy need to come back and students need to be able to do so,"" he told Times Radio.

Several universities say they are ready to reopen next month after weeks of preparation and some students say they have already spent money on such things as housing in preparation for the new term.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga will join the race to succeed his boss Shinzo Abe as prime minister, local media said on Sunday, as the competition heats up to succeed Japan's longest-serving leader.
Suga, a longtime lieutenant of Abe's in a key supporting role, had denied interest in the top job but attracted attention with a series of interviews, to Reuters and other news organisations, in the days before Abe's abrupt resignation for health reasons.
A Suga government would extend the fiscal and monetary stimulus that defined Abe's nearly eight years in office. 
Abe's announcement on Friday, citing a worsening of a chronic illness, set the stage for a leadership election within his Liberal Democratic Party. The LDP president is virtually assured of being prime minister because of the party's majority in the lower house of parliament. 
Suga decided to join the LDP race judging that he should play a leading role, given expectations for his ability to manage crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Japan's deepest postwar economic dive, Kyodo news agency said, citing an unnamed source. 
Calls to Suga's parliamentary office seeking comment on Sunday went unanswered.
Suga would join such candidates as former foreign minister Fumio Kishida and former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba.
Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, 39, the son of charismatic former premier Junichiro Koizumi and considered a future premier, has decided not to run, but he would back Defence Minister Taro Kono if he joins the race, NHK said.
Former internal affairs minister Seiko Noda and former defence minister Tomomi Inada, who is known as a fiscal hawk, are interested in seeking to become Japan's first female premier, media reported.
Calls to their offices went unanswered.
BANDWAGON
Suga, a self-made politician in a country of political dynasties, was chosen by Abe in 2012 for the pivotal role of chief cabinet secretary, acting as top government spokesman, coordinating policies and riding herd on bureaucrats. 
""I'm thinking of running in the LDP leadership race. I'd like you to support me,"" Suga told LDP secretary-general Toshihiro Nikai in a secret meeting on Saturday, TV Tokyo reported.
Nikai's faction will likely support Suga if he runs, Takeo Kawamura, a senior faction official, told reporters after a meeting of the group's leaders.
""Everyone wants to be on the winning side, so if Nikai is supporting Suga, they will jump on the bandwagon,"" said Koichi Nakano, political science professor at Sophia University.
LDP heavyweights aim to hold a slimmed-down leadership contest around Sept. 13 to 15, public broadcaster NHK said on Sunday. The party is likely to decide on the scaled-down version on Tuesday, Kawamura said.
Usually, a leadership vote is held by LDP members of parliament along with grassroots party members in a month-long process. But in the event of a sudden resignation, an extraordinary vote can be called with participants narrowed to MPs and representatives of the LDP local chapters.
The scaled-down version may disadvantage Ishiba, a longtime Abe critic who promotes boosting regional economies in Japan's depopulating hinterlands. He is popular with the public but less so among party MPs.
A call to his parliamentary office went unanswered.
Suga ranks low in voter polls of preferred next premier. He projects the image of a behind-the-scenes operator, more than frontline leader, so some analysts doubt he would be best to lead the LDP into a general election that must be held by late October 2021.

LDP factions will play a dominant role in the election, Sophia's Nakano said. There might be media criticism that this is not a real contest, which might give Ishiba a bump up, but ""not enough to change the momentum,"" he said.

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2020 04:47AM ET</span>",Divided Montenegro starts knife-edge election,"By Fedja Grulovic
PODGORICA (Reuters) - Montenegrins go to the polls on Sunday in a parliamentary election that looks too close to call, with neither the long-ruling pro-Western party nor a rival pro-Serb and pro-Russian alliance tipped to win a majority of seats.
At stake is the political future of President Milo Djukanovic. He leads the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) and has governed Montenegro since the start of the break-up of federal Yugoslavia in 1990 and through the dissolution of its union with Serbia in 2006.
Staunchly pro-Western Djukanovic has overseen Montenegro's ongoing efforts to qualify for membership of the European Union and was instrumental in securing its accession to NATO in 2017.
The vote pits the DPS against an alliance of mainly Serb nationalist parties seeking closer ties to Serbia and Russia.
Led by university professor Zdravko Krivokapic, it is backed by the powerful Serbian Orthodox Church, which holds daily protests against a law adopted last December that allows the state to seize religious assets whose historical ownership cannot be proven.
Montenegrins who identify as Serbs account for about a third of the 620,000 population. Most Montenegrins and Serbs share language and the Orthodox faith, and many Serbian citizens have roots and families in Montenegro.
On election day in 2016, authorities thwarted an attempt by Russian agents and a group of Serb nationalists to topple the government, kill Djukanovic who then served as the prime minister, halt the country's accession to NATO and bring a pro-Russian alliance to power. 
Moscow repeatedly dismissed accusations of involvement as absurd.
At the polling station in Montenegro's historical capital Cetinje, Metropolitan Amfilohije, the head of the largest church diocese in the country, voted for the first time in his lifetime in a bid to mobilise voters. 
Asked if he feared the probability of violent protests after the vote, Amfilohije said: ""There will be no unrest, only the love of God."" 
He earlier called on people to vote against the government and what he described as ""lawless (religion) law"".
The DPS has 42 deputies in the outgoing 81-seat parliament, but polls suggest neither it nor the nationalists are on course to secure an absolute majority, making them reliant on coalition partners to form a government.
Momir, a pensioner from Cetinje, said he hoped Montenegrins would ""continue to live ... as we lived so far"".
""Not (with) these processions, this disgrace,"" he said in a reference to daily protests staged by the church.
Opposition leaders and democracy and rights watchdogs have accused Djukanovic and his party of running Montenegro as their own fiefdom with links to organised crime.
They deny this, and Djukanovic - who faces re-election as the president in 2023 - and his top associates have in turn accused Serbia and Russia of using the church and the pro-Serb opposition to undermine the independence of the mountainous coastal republic.
Montenegro has also been combating a coronavirus outbreak that has infected more than 4,500 people, caused 89 deaths, and gutted the Adriatic tourism that is a key driver of its economy.

Polling stations will close at 8:00 p.m.(1800 GMT). First partial results are due around 10:00 p.m.

Lebanese authorities are probing what caused highly explosive material stored unsafely for years to detonate in a mushroom cloud, wrecking swathes of the city and fuelling anger at a political class already blamed for the country's economic meltdown.
The army said on Saturday that seven people were still missing - three Lebanese, three Syrians and one Egyptian. It was not immediately clear if some had since been found.
The Aug. 4 explosion left 300,000 people homeless and caused $15 billion in direct damage, said the report issued on Sunday by the presidency of the council of ministers. 
It said 50,000 houses, nine major hospitals and 178 schools had been damaged.
The outgoing government quit over the blast. 

The presidency will talk to parliamentary blocs on Monday to designate a new prime minister, a day before French President Emmanuel Macron visits to press leaders to act to save the country from a deep financial crisis rooted in endemic corruption and mismanagement.

(Reuters) - One person was shot dead in Portland late on Saturday as protesters from rival groups clashed in the northwest U.S. city, which has seen frequent demonstrations for months that have at times turned violent.
Police said in statements that both the death and protest violence occurred in downtown Portland. However, they did not immediately link the shooting death to the protests.
""(Police) responded and located a victim with a gunshot wound to the chest. Medical responded and determined that the victim was deceased,"" a Portland police spokesman said in an emailed statement.
""A Homicide Investigation is underway.""
Sounds of gunfire were heard in the area of Southeast 3rd Avenue and Southwest Alder Street, according to the spokesman's statement.
The police said they were not currently releasing suspect information.
When asked by Reuters if the shooting was related to clashes between rival protesters in the same area, the spokesman said ""it is too early in the investigation to draw those kinds of conclusions"".
The New York Times and the Oregonian newspapers reported that a large group of supporters of President Donald Trump had traveled in a caravan through downtown Portland, with a pro-Trump gathering drawing hundreds of trucks full of supporters into the city. 
The Times cited two unidentified witnesses as saying a small group of people got into an argument with other people in a vehicle and someone opened fire.
The man who was shot and killed was wearing a hat with the insignia of Patriot Prayer, a far-right group based in Portland that has clashed with protesters in the past, according to the New York Times. Reuters could not independently verify this.
Portland police earlier said in a tweet that a ""political rally is caravanning throughout downtown Portland"" and that there had been ""some instances of violence between demonstrators and counter-demonstrators.""
Police had intervened and made some arrests, they said in the tweet.
The New York Times reported that Trump supporters and counter-protesters clashed on the streets, with people shooting paint ball guns from the beds of pickup trucks and protesters throwing objects back at them.
The pro-Trump vehicle rally began near Clackamas Town Center before reaching Portland on Saturday evening, with clashes breaking out thereafter between Trump supporters and counter-protesters, the Oregonian reported. 
It added that the shooting took place after most of the caravan had left downtown.
Demonstrations against racism and police brutality have swept the United States since the death in May of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
Tensions between rival protest groups have roiled downtown Portland every night for nearly three months following Floyd's death.

The Trump administration in July deployed federal forces to Portland to crack down on the protests.

China seized control over Tibet in 1950 in what it describes as a ""peaceful liberation"" that helped the remote Himalayan region throw off its ""feudalist"" past. But critics, led by exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, say Beijing's rule amounts to ""cultural genocide"".
At a senior Communist Party meeting on Tibet's future governance, Xi lauded achievements made and praised frontline officials but said more efforts were needed to enrich, rejuvenate and strengthen unity in the region.
Political and ideological education needed to be strengthened in Tibet's schools in order to ""plant the seeds of loving China in the depths of the hearts of every youth"", Xi said in remarks published by state news agency Xinhua. 
Pledging to build a ""united, prosperous, civilised, harmonious and beautiful new, modern, socialist Tibet"", Xi said China needed to strengthen the role of the Communist Party in the territory and better integrate its ethnic groups.
Tibetan Buddhism also needed to adapt to socialism and to Chinese conditions, he added.
Advocacy group the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) said Xi's remarks showed Chinese rule still needed to be imposed with an ""iron fist"".
In emailed comments, its president, Matteo Mecacci, said, ""If Tibetans really benefited as much from Chinese leadership as Xi and other officials claim, then China wouldn't have to fear separatism and wouldn't need to subject Tibetans to political re-education.""
China's policies towards Tibet have come under the spotlight again this year amid worsening ties with the United States.

In July, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States would restrict visas for some Chinese officials involved in blocking diplomatic access to Tibet and engaging in ""human rights abuses"", adding that Washington supported ""meaningful autonomy"" for Tibet.

The accreditations, issued by the Foreign Ministry, were revoked for 17 journalists including a video journalist and a photographer from Reuters, two from the BBC and four from Radio Liberty, the Belarusian Association of Journalists said. 
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Anatoly Glaz could not be reached for comment. 
A Reuters spokesperson said in a statement that Reuters journalists had been stripped of their accreditation, adding ""We are not aware of any acts by our Belarus journalists that might warrant loss of accreditation.""
""We hope the authorities will reinstate their credentials to ensure our journalists can continue to deliver independent, unbiased news in the public interest,"" the spokesperson said. 
Radio Liberty in a report on its website cited the Foreign Ministry as saying the decision to revoke the accreditations was taken for security reasons. The ministry declined to say how many journalists had lost their accreditation, Radio Liberty said.
In comments at a government meeting on July 23, President Alexander Lukashenko threatened to expel foreign journalists, accusing them of inciting protests against him before the Aug. 9 election.
Lukashenko denies opposition accusations that he rigged the election to prolong his 26-year rule. Thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand he step down. 
The U.S. Embassy in Minsk issued a statement on Saturday that did not refer specifically to the revocation of accreditations, but said, ""We are concerned by the continued targeting of journalists, the blocking of independent media and opposition websites"" as well as intermittent internet blackouts and detentions of citizens exercising their rights of free assembly and speech. 
The embassy could not be reached for further comment. The U.S. State Department did not respond to a request for comment.
The BBC said in a statement that two journalists working for the BBC Russian service had had their accreditations revoked, with immediate effect, and called on the authorities to reverse the decision.
""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this stifling of independent journalism,"" the BBC said. 
On Saturday, AFP's Global News Director Phil Chetwynd issued a statement calling on the authorities in Belarus to reinstate the accreditations of its Belarusian journalists to enable them to ""continue to provide independent and impartial reporting of the facts."" The statement, which did not disclose how many journalists were affected, also said the AFP was given no explanation for the government's action and that it was ""not aware of any reason for the press credentials to be withdrawn."" 

Daisy Sindelar, the acting president of RFE/RL, a nonprofit that is funded by a grant from the U.S. Congress, said in a statement that ""Stripping our journalists of accreditation on grounds of 'extremism' is a desperate and ominous move by an authoritarian government to stifle the independent media"".

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>","A picture and its story: The despair of a Rio widow, in a city struggling with violence","RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - For Ricardo Moraes, a veteran photographer who for 11 years has documented for Reuters life in Rio de Janeiro's often dangerous cinderblock slums known as ""favelas"", work began at about 6 a.m. on Thursday, when he heard a radio report of a hostage situation in Sao Carlos, a sprawling tangle of hillside homes near the city center. 
The images he would capture - a young woman, kneeling over her husband's body, overcome with grief and surrounded by heavily armed police - ultimately would appear on the front pages of Brazil's two largest newspapers. They resonated in a city fed up with violence, where residents say shootouts among aggressive criminal gangs and a notoriously deadly police force are common. 
The incident culminating in the photographs began when a man who police later identified as a drug trafficker took a family of three hostage in an apartment building. 
He surrendered but hours later police exchanged gunfire with other suspects near the lobby, and the fighting quickly spilled into the surrounding area.
Then another family was taken hostage in a house nearby, by another heavily armed group. As negotiations with police ensued, female relatives of the drug gang gathered nearby.
Hours later, the hostage-takers surrendered and exited the second building.
But one of them was missing.
Behind the police, the women edged closer to the home. Sprawled on a staircase was a dead body.
That is when the subject of Moraes' photograph broke into tears.
Surrounded by police dressed in military-style gear, the images show the young woman collapsing in despair as she recognizes the body. Another woman comforts her. 
When Moraes visited the local morgue on Friday morning, he saw the woman again, distraught and surrounded by family. She agreed to talk.
In a brief interview, the woman, who identified herself only as Juliana, said she was the wife of the slain man, who she named as Davi Barboza. She said she was four months pregnant with his child. She acknowledged he was a criminal and made an appeal to those who broke the law to make ends meet. 
""I want to ask whoever is in that life to get out,"" Juliana told Moraes, choking back tears. 
""Think of your family because it's very difficult for us. I don't know how I'm going to go back home and not see him anymore."" 
Reuters was not able to verify the exact chain of events leading to Barboza's death, nor the cause of his death. State police said in a statement they had exchanged heavy fire with criminals throughout the day and confiscated various weapons, but did not offer more details about individuals in a statement provided to Reuters. 
Moraes said that when he rushed to the apartment building that morning he never expected to encounter such an emotional scene.
""But ever since the coronavirus pandemic arrived in Brazil, I've been hearing a phrase which I thought about when I began to photograph Juliana: everyone is loved by someone.""
Juliana's pain is not unique in Brazil, which last year recorded more homicides than any other country in the world. Rio de Janeiro alone registered 3,025 homicides. Another 1,814 people were killed by police.

""My husband, he was what he was. But he was a good man,"" said Juliana. ""He was my prince.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - The main Syrian opposition called on major powers on Saturday to help clinch a nationwide ceasefire in coming months to pave the way for a political transition after nearly a decade of war.
Hadi al-Bahra, the Syrian opposition co-chair of the Syrian Constitutional Committee, was speaking to reporters in Geneva after week-long U.N.-sponsored talks.
The 45-member committee composed of representatives of the government, opposition and civil society, has a mandate to draw up a new Constitution leading to U.N.-supervised elections.
U.N. Special Envoy Geir Pedersen said that there were ""many areas of disagreement"", but also ""quite a few areas of commonalities"". ""My hope is with continued calm on the ground...we will also see some progress,"" he told a briefing.
Pedersen, referring to a ceasefire brokered by Turkey and Russia in March in the last remaining rebel-held bastion of Idlib in northwest Syria, said it was ""by and large holding"" despite violations.
Bahra said that as long as there was no nationwide ceasefire, the political process would remain stalled.
It was the responsibility of the international community and countries supporting either warring side to push for a full and permanent ceasefire, he said.
""When we see that happen we will see the political process moving faster, because all sides they will know that there is no way for them to achieve a final victory on military terms,"" he said.

POCONÉ, Brazil (Reuters) - The world's largest wetland is ablaze, but the fire is often invisible.
In Brazil's Pantanal, the vegetation compacted under the marshy flood water during the wet season dries out as ponds and lagoons evaporate, leaving flammable deposits underground that can continue to smolder long after visible flames die down.
Firefighters across Brazil are battling raging towers of flames from the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest to the Cerrado savannah, but the fires beneath their feet are a particular challenge in the Pantanal. The only way to combat an underground fires is to dig a trench around it, said state firefighter Lieutenant Isaac Wihby.
""But how do you do that if you have a line of fire that's 20 kilometers long? It's not viable,"" he said.
The fires here are the worst in 15 years. The flames threaten the region's biodiversity, rich with tapirs, pumas, capybaras and the world's most dense population of jaguars.
The Pantanal, whose name derives from the Portuguese word for ""swamp,"" sprawls over more than 150,000 sq km in Brazil and also extends into Bolivia and Paraguay.
As fires approached emergency workers in the Pantanal this week, they used tractors to cut through desiccated trees and shrubs, leaving a gash of brown dirt meant to rob the flames of fuel and stop their spread.
But strong winds can send the flames over the top, or underground fires can pass below.
""Sometimes it passes under a firebreak and takes the firefighters by surprise,"" said Lieutenant Jean Oliveira, who is leading the firefighting efforts.
""Sometimes you control a fire and it's not really dead, it's just sleeping,"" he said.
Hundreds of firefighters, environmental workers, park rangers and soldiers have worked 24 hours a day for weeks attempting to extinguish flames that have destroyed thousands of square kilometers of the Pantanal.
With temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), one fire this week was unstoppable as strong winds pushed it across multiple firebreaks, burning through twisted branches and dry leaves through the day and into the night.
""We controlled it but then it jumped there, jumped there, jumped there,"" said Edmilson Rodrigo da Silva, a firefighter for Brazil's center-west state of Mato Grosso, pointing far into the distance to where the fire had gotten past firebreaks.
The region is a vast flood plain that normally fills with water during the rainy season, roughly from November to March. But the floods were lower than normal this year and a subsequent drought has left the area dangerously susceptible to fire.
The Pantanal so far this month recorded 4,677 ""hot spots"" in the worst rash of fires since August 2005, according to Brazil's space research agency, Inpe.
Silva was one of about 20 men battling the fire through the night, bathed in choking smoke and swarmed by gnats flushed out of the undergrowth by flames that encircled the firefighters on three sides. They warned to look out for poisonous snakes and jaguars fleeing the fire in the night.
Rains brought temporary relief to the southern half of the Pantanal last week, but fires again began to pick up this week. Next month could be even worse.

""It's our worst year here for fires. It's never been dry like this,"" Silva said.

President Alexander Lukashenko denies opposition accusations that he rigged the Aug. 9 election to prolong his 26-year rule. He says the protesters are funded by the West, and accuses NATO of massing forces on Belarusian frontiers, which the alliance denies.
The women on Saturday staged what they called a march of solidarity, calling on Lukashenko and his government to step down.
""This is our city"" and ""you better protect us,"" chanted the crowd, many of them sporting national dress.

Streets along the protest route were cordoned off by police and security troops. Rallies on a smaller scale took place in other cities and towns.

ROME (Reuters) - The Italian coastguard sent help on Saturday to a rescue boat funded by British street artist Banksy after the vessel issued urgent calls for assistance, saying it was stranded in the Mediterranean and overloaded with migrants.
The coastguard said a patrol boat dispatched from the southern Italian island of Lampedusa had taken on board 49 of ""those considered most vulnerable"" among the 219 migrants picked up by the ship since Thursday off the coast of Libya.
Named after a French feminist anarchist, the Louise Michel started operating last week. Despite the help from Italy, it has still not found a safe port for the rest of the mainly African migrants on board.
The 49 people who were transferred off the ship include 32 women and 13 children, the Italian coastguard said.
The Louise Michel, a German boat manned by a crew of 10, issued a series of tweets overnight and on Saturday saying its situation was worsening, and appealing for help from authorities in Italy, Malta and Germany.
""We are reaching a state of emergency. We need immediate assistance,"" said one tweet, adding that it was also carrying a body bag containing the corpse of one migrant who had died.
Another tweet said the boat was unable to move and ""no longer the master of her own destiny"" due to her overcrowded deck and a life raft deployed at her side, ""but above all due to Europe ignoring our emergency calls for immediate assistance.""
Before Italy's coastguard intervened, an Italian charity ship, the Mare Jonio, said it was leaving the Sicilian port of Augusta, much further away than Lampedusa, to offer assistance. 
Two United Nations' agencies called for the ""urgent disembarkation"" of the Louise Michel and two other ships carrying a total of more than 400 migrants in the Mediterranean.
Some 200 are on the Sea Watch 4, a German charity ship, while 27 have been on board the commercial tanker Maersk Etienne since their rescue on Aug. 5.
The International Organisation for Migration and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in a joint statement they were ""deeply concerned about the continued absence of dedicated EU-led search and rescue capacity in the Central Mediterranean"".
""The humanitarian imperative of saving lives should not be penalized or stigmatized, especially in the absence of dedicated state-led efforts,"" they said. 
Italy is the destination of most migrants who have departed from Libya across the Mediterranean in recent years. The influx has created political tensions in Rome and fuelled the success of Matteo Salvini's right-wing League party. 
The 30-metre long (98-foot) Louise Michel, a former French Navy boat daubed in pink and white, was bought with proceeds from the sale of Banksy artwork.
The side of the vessel's cabin features a picture of a girl holding a heart-shaped life buoy in Banksy's familiar stencilled style.

Bristol-born Banksy, who keeps his identity a secret, is known for his political or social-commentary graffiti that has popped up in cities around the world.

Thirteen provinces, mostly in the country's north, had been affected by floods, according to the Ministry for Disaster Management. 
In Parwan, just north of the capital Kabul, 116 people had been killed and more than 120 injured, with 15 people still missing, national and local officials said.
""Rescue teams are still in the area and searching for the missing bodies,"" said Wahida Shahkar, a spokeswoman for Parwan's governor. 
Flash flooding hit Parwan early on Wednesday, washing away homes and buildings.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - The head of the Czech Senate travelled to Taiwan on Saturday for a rare trip by a senior foreign official that has angered China, which considers the island a breakaway province ineligible for state-to-state relations.
Senate speaker Milos Vystrcil said his visit would promote business links with Taiwan, and that the Czech Republic would not bow to Beijing's objections.
""You cannot accept being someone's servant, because if you do, then when you obey once, it's assumed that you obey every time,"" Vystrcil told Reuters ahead of the trip.
Vystrcil said his visit underscored the ""values-based"" foreign policy put in place by late President Vaclav Havel, an anti-communist dissident and personal friend of the exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama.
The delegation is due to meet President Tsai Ing-wen and other top officials in Taiwan, where strict coronavirus measures will be observed during the meetings.
For Taiwan, the Czech visit is a welcome sign of support amid growing tensions with China. 
""Taiwan and the Czech Republic both share the universal values of democracy, freedom and human rights,"" Johnson Chiang, head of the European Affairs Office at Taiwan's Foreign Ministry's, told reporters this week. 
Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar went to Taiwan in the highest-level visit by a U.S. official in four decades.
Vystrcil's trip has further complicated relations between China and the EU country.
Czech President Milos Zeman has sought closer business and political ties with China since taking office in 2013, but his efforts have been hit by failed investment plans and Czech wavering about allowing China's Huawei Technologies to play a role in developing next-generation telecoms networks. 
China warned of possible consequences for Czech companies with Chinese operations when Vystrcil's predecessor started planning a trip to the self-ruled island.
""Such a visit is deliberately undermining the political foundation between China and the Czech Republic, we condemn such a despicable act,"" China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Thursday.

More than a dozen Armenian and Azeri soldiers were killed in July at the border between the two, which have long been at odds over Azerbaijan's breakaway, mainly ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
Russia has called the conflict is a highly sensitive matter.
Hikmet Hajiyev, a senior adviser to Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev, said Russia has been ""intensively arming Armenia"" right after the July conflict, with Russian Il-76 strategic airlifters flying towards Armenia after July 17.
The Russian foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.
Russia has a military base in Armenia and considers it to be a strategic partner in the South Caucasus region and supplies it with weapons. 
Russia told Azerbaijan that those Il-76 planes were carrying building materials, Hajiyev said, adding that Baku was not satisfied with this answer.
""Construction materials are usually not supplied in aeroplanes, there are other tools for that,"" Hajiyev said.
""Based on observations we also have information that arms are being shipped to the Syrian territory via the Armenia territory,"" he added.

The long-running dispute between Turkey and Greece, both NATO members, flared after the two countries agreed rival accords on their maritime boundaries with Libya and Egypt, and Turkey sent a survey vessel into contested waters this month.
Both sides have held military exercises in the east Mediterranean, highlighting the potential for the dispute over the extent of their continental shelves to escalate into confrontation. 
Two weeks ago Greek and Turkish frigates shadowing Turkey's Oruc Reis oil and gas survey vessel collided, and Turkey's Defence Ministry said Turkish F-16 jets on Thursday prevented six Greek F-16s entering an area where Turkey was operating.
On Friday night Turkey issued a Navtex notice - an advisory message to mariners - saying it would be holding a ""gunnery exercise"" from Saturday until Sept. 11 off northwest Cyprus.
The European Union's top diplomat said on Friday the bloc was preparing sanctions against Turkey that could be discussed at a summit in late September in response to Ankara's standoff with EU member Greece.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay criticised the possible measures, which could target individuals, ships or the use of European ports in an attempt to limit Ankara's exploration capabilities.

""It is insincere for the EU to call for dialogue on the one hand and make other plans on the other, regarding the activities we carry out in our own continental shelf in the east Mediterranean,"" he said on Twitter.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The president of the United Arab Emirates scrapped an economic boycott against Israel, allowing trade and financial agreements between the countries in another key step towards normal ties, the UAE's state news agency reported on Saturday.
Israel and the UAE said on Aug. 13 they would normalise diplomatic relations in a deal brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump that reshapes the order of Middle East politics from the Palestinian issue to the fight against Iran.
President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan issued a decree abolishing a boycott law as part of ""the UAE's efforts to expand diplomatic and commercial cooperation with Israel, leading to bilateral relations by stimulating economic growth and promoting technological innovation,"" the WAM news agency said.
The announcement came as Israeli flag carrier  El Al  Israel Airlines Ltd (TA:ELAL) prepared to operate the country's first direct flight between Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport and the UAE's capital, Abu Dhabi.
An Israeli government delegation and top aides to Trump, including his senior adviser Jared Kushner, are due to travel on the flight on Aug. 31, a U.S. official said.
Before the Aug. 13 deal can be officially signed, details must be agreed on issues such as the opening of embassies, trade and travel links.
Israel’s Channel 13 TV said bilateral trade could initially be worth $4 billion a year, a figure it said could soon be tripled or quadrupled. Government officials did not immediately confirm that estimate.
Israeli Agriculture Minister Alon Schuster said Israel was working on potential joint projects that could help improve the oil-rich Gulf nation's food security, such as water desalination and crop cultivation in the desert.
""With their money and our experience, we could go a long way,"" he told Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM in an interview on Friday.
Officials from the two countries recently said they were looking at cooperation in defence, medicine, tourism and technology.
The decree announced on Saturday means UAE citizens and businesses will be free to do business with Israel.
The two countries do not yet have official air links, and it was unclear whether Monday's El Al flight would be able to fly over Saudi Arabia - which has no official ties with Israel - to cut down on flight time.

In May, an Etihad Airways plane flew from the UAE to Tel Aviv to deliver supplies to the Palestinians to help fight coronavirus, marking the first known flight by an UAE carrier to Israel.

(Reuters) - Thousands of protesters demonstrated in the Mauritius capital Port Louis on Saturday to demand an investigation into an oil spill from a Japanese ship and the mysterious death of at least 40 dolphins that have been found near the site of the spill. 
Environmentalists have called for an investigation into whether the dolphins died as a result of the spill caused when the bulk carrier, the MV Wakashio, struck a coral reef last month.
One protestor held a banner with a dolphin covered in oil reading ""our lives matter"" and another held one calling for the government to resign. Mauritian flags were waved across the packed square of St Louis Cathedral. 
""We do not trust the government and the diluted information they've been feeding us regarding the management and responses to the oil spill,"" Fabiola Monty, 33 a Mauritian environmental scientist, told Reuters from the square.
The government has said it will carry out autopsies on all the dead dolphins and has set up a commission to look into the oil spill. Two investigations are being carried out: one by the police on the crew's responsibilities and one by a senior Shipping Ministry official on what happened to the ship.
So far veterinarians have examined only two of the mammals' carcasses, which bore signs of injury but no trace of oil in their bodies, according to preliminary autopsy results.
The autopsy on the first two was conducted by the government-run Albion Fisheries Research Centre.
Autopsy results on 25 dolphins that washed ashore Wednesday and Thursday are expected in the coming days, according to Jasvin Sok Appadu from the Fisheries Ministry. 

Local environmental group Eco-Sud, which took part in Saturday's protest, said in a statement on Friday that representatives from civil society should be present during the autopsies and called for a second opinion from independent specialists.

Kono shared his view with the U.S. defense secretary at a time when the United States and China are at loggerheads over issues ranging from technology and human rights to Chinese military activities in the disputed South China Sea.
A thorny issue in China's ties with Japan is Beijing's claim to a group of tiny East China Sea islets controlled by Tokyo.
""We agreed that the international community will respond firmly to any unilateral change to the status quo in the South China Sea as well as the East China Sea,"" Kono said. 
He was speaking online from Guam to reporters in the Japanese capital following his meeting with Esper.
Kono said Esper had confirmed that the U.S.-Japan security treaty covered the East China Sea islets, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China.
Turning to Japan's domestic politics, Kono said he would think hard about running in a ruling party election to choose a successor to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who abruptly announced his resignation for health reasons on Friday.
The United States has long opposed China's expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea and has sent warships regularly through the strategic waterway.
China claims 90% of the potentially energy-rich waters but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of it.

About $3 trillion worth of trade passes through the waterway each year. China has built bases atop atolls in the region but says its intentions are peaceful.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Yoshihide Suga, a longtime lieutenant of Japan's Shinzo Abe, has emerged as a strong contender to succeed him as prime minister, an outcome that would extend the fiscal and monetary stimulus that defined Abe's nearly eight years in office.
Abe, Japan's longest-serving premier, said on Friday he was stepping down due to a worsening of a chronic illness, setting the stage for a leadership election within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
While some other would-be successors have declared their intention to run, the 71-year-old Suga has said he doesn't want the job. But such comments have been called into question by an aggressive media push in recent days that put him squarely in the public eye.
""They are really going to try to get Suga to replace Abe and continue the Abe government without Abe,"" said Sophia University political science professor Koichi Nakano.
In an interview with Reuters this week, Suga stressed the need to spur economic growth over tightening restrictions to contain the virus, pointing to the need to promote tourism.
""We need to consider what we can do to prevent the economy from falling off a cliff,"" Suga said at his parliamentary office, where a large photograph of him standing next to U.S. President Donald Trump was on display.
The interview, in which Suga again denied he wanted the job, was part of the publicity blitz before Abe announced his resignation, in which he gave interviews to at least four major news organisations.
A self-made politician, Suga was chosen by Abe in 2012 for the pivotal role of chief cabinet secretary, acting as top government spokesman, coordinating policies and riding herd on bureaucrats. 
The winner of the LDP vote, which domestic media said could be held around Sept. 15, is virtually ensured the premiership because of the party's majority in parliament. The victor will serve out Abe's remaining term as LDP chief, which ends in September 2021.
Former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba, 63, a soft-spoken security hawk who aims to revive Japan's regional economies, is also expected to run. A long-time Abe critic, Ishiba is popular with the public but less so among party members of parliament.
Ex-foreign minister Fumio Kishida, 63, long seen as Abe's favoured heir, said on Friday he would run in the party poll, but the dovish lawmaker from Hiroshima has struggled to gain traction with voters.
Dark-horse potential candidates include Defence Minster Taro Kono, 56, who has an image as a maverick but has toed the line on key Abe policies, and Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, 64, who has a reputation as a tough negotiator. 
Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi is popular but at 39 seen by many as too young.
What format party executives pick to choose their next leader will have a big impact on the outcome. A decision is expected on Tuesday.
Usually, a leadership vote is held by LDP MPs along with grassroots party members. 
In case of a sudden resignation, however, an extraordinary vote can be called with participants narrowed to MPs and representatives of the party's local chapters.
""A regular election gives Ishiba a better chance,"" said Steven Reed, professor emeritus at Chuo University. 
In 2012, Ishiba beat Abe in a first-round party poll that included rank-and-file members but he failed to win a majority and lost in a run-off, when only MPs voted.
Ishiba could also have an edge if LDP lawmakers put priority on a leader who would help the party keep its huge majority in a lower house election that must be held by late October 2021.
Talk of Suga as a contender bubbled up in April 2019 after he unveiled the new imperial era name, ""Reiwa"", for use on Japanese calendars after the enthronement of the new emperor.
Still, the veteran lawmaker has an image more as a behind-the-scenes operator than a frontline leader.

""The stamp of approval will come through dealmaking in smoky backrooms in the LDP, but whoever wins will have to prove themselves by winning the next general election,"" said Jesper Koll, senior adviser to asset manager Wisdom Tree Investments.

""Some politicians and institutions deliberately twist and smear the normal exchange and cooperation between the two countries or even clamor for the so-called 'new cold war' against China,"" the spokesman said in a statement posted on the embassy's official website.
Chinese diplomats in Britain are ""serving as a bridge"" between the two countries and promote mutually beneficial cooperation, he said. They deserve a fair assessment ""rather than distortion and accusation"". 
Responding to the charge that Beijing was taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to pursue its ""wolf warrior"" diplomatic agenda, the spokesman said Chinese diplomats had a duty to tell the real story ""in the face of misinterpretations, misunderstandings and even deliberate slanders"".
""Wolf warrior"" diplomacy is the name given to a more aggressive approach to international relations by China's foreign representatives, with many now using social media to push back against international criticism.
Ties between London and Beijing have become increasingly strained in recent months amid disputes over Hong Kong as well as Britain's move to block Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from participating in its 5G rollout.

Abe said it is up to the LDP leadership to determine the schedule of the party election but that he believes his health will hold up until a successor is chosen. 
Usually, the party must announce the leadership election a month in advance, but in the case of a sudden resignation, an extraordinary vote can be called ""at the soonest date possible"" among members of parliament and local LDP chapters.

ABUJA/BAMAKO (Reuters) - Mali's West African neighbours on Friday told the military junta which seized control 10 days ago that it must transfer power to a civilian-led transitional government immediately and hold elections within a year.
In exchange, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) committed to lifting sanctions gradually as the coup leaders complied with its demands, the bloc's chairman said.
ECOWAS suspended Mali from its institutions, shut borders and halted financial flows with the country following the overthrow of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on Aug. 18. 
On Friday, the 15-member group reinforced its hard line because of concerns about prolonged instability in Mali and its potential to undermine the fight against Islamist militants there and in the wider Sahel region.
It outlined four main points it wanted to see progress on before sanctions could be gradually lifted. 
Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou, who currently chairs ECOWAS, said Mali's transitional president and prime minister must be civilians, and would be banned from running in the next legislative and presidential elections.
""No military structure should be above the transitional president,"" Issoufou said.
ECOWAS also called for the quick establishment of a government that will tackle the various challenges Mali is facing, and in particular prepare for legislative and presidential elections within 12 months.
A spokesman for the junta, Djibrila Maiga, said its leaders were still studying the bloc's decisions.
The junta issued a statement on Friday evening inviting Mali's political parties including Keita's ruling coalition and civil society groups to a meeting on Saturday to discuss the organisation of the transition.
Some members of Mali's opposition coalition, the M5-RFP, which held several demonstrations calling for Keita to resign before the coup, said the regional leaders were misreading the situation.
""ECOWAS needs to revise its position,"" Clement Dembele, a member of the coalition and a former presidential candidate, said in Bamako.
""The question, today, is that Mali needs statesmen. Mali doesn't need a civilian or a soldier but a statesman,"" he said. 
The junta leaders said after taking power that they acted because the country was sinking into chaos, insecurity and corruption, blaming poor leadership.
The soldiers behind the coup are anxious to get the sanctions lifted and, as a gesture of goodwill, released Keita on Thursday and allowed him to return home.
They also cut their proposed duration of a transition to democracy to two years from three.
Mountaga Tall, another member of the M5-RFP coalition, said Mali's needs must be identified first before fixing the deadline for a transition.
""It would be more rational, more reassuring to establish the tasks for the transition and, relative to the immensity of these tasks, to then decide if it will be three months, two years or three years,"" he said. 
Two diplomats who attended the conference said there was room for the transition to be extended for a couple of months beyond the ECOWAS deadline.
Regional leaders are scheduled to meet again on Sept. 7 in Niger's capital Niamey, where they will assess the situation in Mali and take other measures, if necessary, Issoufou said.
Mali has struggled to regain stability since a Tuareg uprising in 2012 was hijacked by Islamist militants.

A French intervention drove back the insurgents but since 2018 the country has seen a sharp increase in violence and insecurity that has driven more than half a million people from their homes.

Guan Lei, 29, of Alhambra, California, a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, was arrested after he was seen throwing a damaged hard drive into a dumpster outside his apartment in July, the department said in a statement.
""Guan is being investigated for possibly transferring sensitive U.S. software or technical data to China’s National University of Defense Technology"" and falsely denying his association with the Chinese military on his visa application and in interviews with federal agents, the Justice Department said.
The statement did not say when the investigation started.
Guan made an initial court appearance on Friday and an arraignment was scheduled for Sept. 17, the statement said. The felony offense of destruction of evidence carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.

England's nearly 25,000 schools are set to return full time next week after many saw only a fraction of pupils return for the end of the last academic year.
They face challenges trying to manage the challenges of the coronavirus in busy buildings and what will happen if there is an outbreak in a school, as some other countries have seen.
The survey by the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) of predominantly English schools showed that only 7% of school leaders said they were confident in the government’s test, trace and isolate scheme while 68% were not.
Only 30% are confident that pupils and parents understand government safety guidance for the return to classrooms and only 18% are confident about arrangements in case of a local lockdown in their area.
After failing to persuade schools to bring back all students before the summer, and a scandal over estimated exam results, Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keen to make sure the reopening now happens smoothly as he urges people to get back to some kind of normality after the coronavirus lockdown.
""Very clearly, school leaders need more information about the government’s track and trace scheme, and what the authorities will expect them to do if there is a local lockdown,"" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT said.

""Leaders are also worried that public awareness about the return to school could still be low.""

JINOTEGA, Nicaragua/MANAGUA (Reuters) - Grieving relatives in northern Nicaragua on Friday buried the body of a Nicaraguan agricultural laborer whose death from a heat stroke in Spain this month triggered a debate about working conditions of undocumented migrants in Europe.
Eleazar Blandon, 42, was buried in his home town Jinotega several weeks after his death in Spanish watermelon fields drew media coverage and criticism about the work environment of migrants in wealthy European nations.
""Now you are going to rest in peace, after such a long journey,"" said Blandon's brother, Kamil, during the funeral service which saw musicians trail the coffin through the streets of Jinotega.
Kamil lamented the family's tragic history repeating itself, as four years earlier their father, an undocumented migrant in the United States, had also died working on a farm in Texas.
Toiling in extreme Spanish heat and sun when he collapsed, the father-of-five was taken to a nearby hospital in the south-eastern city of Murcia, his sister Ana Blandon, also an undocumented worker, said in a telephone interview from Spain. 
She said her brother was left at the hospital's entrance and died there. Two family members, one in Nicaragua and one in Spain, confirmed various details of her account. 
Reuters could not independently verify the events. 
Spanish authorities said they are investigating the farm, which could not be contacted by Reuters.
Blandon was among about 26,000 Nicaraguans who last year left their homeland for Spain. Many fled amid weak economic growth and political gridlock following the 2018 protests against the government of President Daniel Ortega, in which 326 people were killed.
Blandon started laboring in Spanish watermelon fields after losing another job during the coronavirus pandemic.
Spanish Labor Minister Yolanda Diaz called the conditions under which Blandon worked ""deplorable"" and his death ""a tragic, dramatic event that speaks very badly of our country"" at a press conference on Aug. 6. 
""His workday started at 7 a.m. and lasted 14 hours during which he was harvesting melons until the afternoon at 44 degrees (Celsius) without any protection,"" she said. ""He died from hypothermic stress.""
One musician at Blandon's funeral wore a t-shirt saying: ""It's not work, it's slavery.""

Requesens had been held since Aug. 7, 2018 at the Helicoide prison in Caracas, run by the Sebin intelligence agency. The opposition, led by National Assembly speaker Juan Guaido, considered Requesens a political prisoner. 
""My brother Juan is home,"" his sister Rafaela Requesens wrote on Twitter. 
His family and political allies denied the allegations of involvement in the drone attack. 
Neither Venezuela's information ministry nor the chief prosecutor's office immediately responded to requests for comment. 
In the video, posted on Instagram by former opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, Requesens is seen on the roof of an apartment building while hugging companions, smiling, and laughing while speaking via video chat on a cell phone. 
He was released just months before parliamentary elections scheduled for December, which the opposition has pledged to boycott, based on charges they will be rigged in favor of Maduro's ruling socialist party. 
Maduro, considered a dictator by the opposition and most western democracies, argues the opposition is unwilling to participate because it believes it will lose control of the National Assembly.

Protesters were throwing objects at police officers and car tyres had been set on fire, a police spokesman said. Earlier in the day, a copy of the Quran had been burned in Malmo by right-wing extremists.
""We don't have this under control but we are working actively to take control,"" the spokesman said.
""We see a connection between what is happening now and what happened earlier today,"" he said.
The demonstrations had escalated in the same place where the Quran had been burned, the spokesman said.
Daily Aftonbladet said several anti-Islam activities had taken place in Malmo on Friday, including three men kicking a copy of the Quran between them in a public square.

The anti-Islam protests occurred after Rasmus Paludan, leader of Danish far-right political party Hard Line, had been denied permission to have a meeting in Malmo and was stopped at the Swedish border, according to the newspaper.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Thousands of people took part in a march in Washington on Friday to denounce racism, on the anniversary of the march in 1963 where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr made his historic ""I Have a Dream"" speech.
""You might have killed the dreamer, but you can't kill the dream,"" civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton told Friday's crowd.
Activists and politicians gave speeches, including Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who appeared in a recorded video. Many referenced U.S. Representative John Lewis, a civil rights hero who spoke at the 1963 march and died in July. 
Speakers stressed the importance of voting in November's election and links between activism for Black civil rights, disability rights and LGBT rights and against gun violence, among other causes. 
""In so many ways, we stand together today in the symbolic shadow of history, but we are making history together right now,"" said Martin Luther King III, Martin Luther King Jr's son.
The half-mile march from the Lincoln Memorial to the Martin Luther King Memorial, on a hot, humid day in the U.S. capital, comes amid a summer of racial unrest book-ended by two high-profile incidents in which Black men were shot by police.
Nationwide protests began in May, sparked by the killing of George Floyd, an African-American man who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
This week, protests broke out in Kenosha, Wisconsin, after police officers shot another African-American man, Jacob Blake, multiple times in front of his children. Though Blake survived, lawyers said he has been paralyzed.
""We will not be your docile slave. We will not be a footstool to oppression,"" said Letetra Widman, Blake's sister.
George Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, appeared on stage as well. At times, he stopped to collect himself, apparently overcome with emotion. 
""I wish George was here to see this,"" he said.
Allisa Findley, sister of Botham Jean, an African-American man killed in Dallas by an off-duty police officer who said she mistook his apartment for her own, said: ""I am tired of adding new names, adding new hashtags to an already long list of victims of police terror. We cannot allow our brothers and sisters to only be remembered for how they died.""
'TOO LITTLE TOO LATE'
James Jarell, a business owner from Delaware, said recent demonstrations of support from corporations and professional athletes was not enough. ""For people who live with the terror of getting shot by the police every day, this is too little, too late,"" he said.
Bella Ridenoure of Arlington, Virginia said President Donald Trump should have acknowledged Black frustrations during his speech on Thursday that closed out the Republican National Convention.
""How much does it hurt President Trump to acknowledge racism?"" the 43-year-old government worker said. ""Instead, he played politics and is now making it look like we are criminals who want the police defunded.""
Sharpton's National Action Network, which planned the event, took steps to protect marchers from the coronavirus pandemic, in which Black people have suffered disproportionately. At one point, a speaker directed attendees to stand with their arms out to ensure there was enough distance between them. Staff wiped down the podium and microphones between speakers.
Black people are more likely to be sickened and die from the virus and to lose jobs from the economic fallout, statistics show.
Though many people wore masks, many others did not.
A virtual commemoration is also planned, featuring Reverend William Barber, a prominent civil rights activist and the co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign. It will also include civil rights activists, politicians, artists and entertainers.
Kerrigan Williams (NYSE:WMB), a founder of Freedom Fighters DC, said the activist group was organizing its own march later on Friday to promote a more radical agenda that includes replacing police departments with other public safety systems.

Separately, a wing of the Movement for Black Lives, a network of Black activists and organizations, has scheduled the ""Black National Convention"" on Friday night, following national conventions by the Democratic and Republican parties over the past two weeks.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - All operations to combat illegal logging in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be halted on Monday due to insufficient funds, Brazil's Environment Ministry said on Friday. 
The move comes despite rising deforestation and growing criticism of Brazil's environmental policy from both environmentalists and international investors, many of whom have threatened to pull out of the country if the government does not show improved results in protecting the Amazon.
The ministry said the move was due to a decision by Brazil's Federal Budget Secretariat, known as the SOF, to block certain funds that had originally been allocated to the Environment Ministry's enforcement arm Ibama and parks service ICMBio. 
The SOF's move, the ministry said, ultimately came from the office of the Chief of Staff for right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro.
""According to information provided to the ministry by Secretary Esteves Colnago of the Economy Ministry, the blockage of nearly 60 million reais ($11.1 million) in funds to Ibama and ICMBio was ordered by the Government Secretary's Office and the Office of the Chief of Staff of the President,"" the ministry said in a statement.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government executed Keith Nelson, a convicted child murderer, on Friday afternoon in its fifth execution since it resumed capital punishment this summer after a 17-year hiatus and despite a ruling the lethal injections violated U.S. drug laws.
Nelson, 45, was declared dead at 4:32 p.m. in the U.S. Department of Justice's execution chamber in Terre Haute, Indiana, after being injected with lethal doses of pentobarbital, a powerful barbiturate, according to a media representative who witnessed the execution.
It was the second execution this week after Lezmond Mitchell, another convicted murderer, was killed on Wednesday. The administration of President Donald Trump, a vocal supporter of capital punishment for serious crimes, has now carried out more federal executions than took place in the preceding 57 years.
On Thursday, a federal judge overseeing legal challenges to the execution protocol by Nelson and other death row inmates ruled that the Justice Department's protocol violated drug safety laws.
Judge Tanya Chutkan of the U.S. District Court in Washington ordered Nelson's execution be delayed until the Justice Department revised its protocol to comply with the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including a requirement that a drug can only be issued on a clinician's prescription.
The Justice Department challenged the injunction delaying the execution in the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia Circuit. The appeals court overturned the injunction on Thursday evening, ruling that Chutkan had not established that violations of the act constituted ""irreparable harm."" 
Chutkan spoke with lawyers representing Nelson and the Justice Department in a telephone conference on Friday as she considered a request by Nelson's lawyers to revise her order or issue a new one blocking Friday's execution. 
Chutkan denied that request less than 90 minutes before Nelson's scheduled execution time, writing that he had not ""convincingly"" shown irreparable injury.
Nelson, who was convicted of raping and murdering 10-year-old Pamela Butler in Kansas in 1999, was one of more than a dozen inmates on federal death row in Terre Haute who sued the Justice Department over its lethal injection protocol, which was announced in 2019, replacing the old three-drug protocol last used in 2003. 

He is now the fourth of those plaintiffs to have since been executed by the Justice Department after the U.S. Supreme Court swiftly dismissed earlier injunctions issued by Chutkan delaying the executions to allow the litigation to proceed.

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 05:41PM ET</span>",Why California's wildfire year could be the worst in decades,"By Andrew Hay
(Reuters) - California may experience its worst year for wildfires in decades, climate experts say, pointing out that it has already battled two of the three largest blazes in its recorded history during an intense heatwave this month - even before the peak season begins.
Record temperatures have exacerbated the state’s ongoing drought and triggered dry-lightning that started more than 700 fires, some in redwood rainforests and Joshua trees that do not normally burn.
Firefighters had a grip on the three largest blazes on Friday in the San Francisco Bay Area but warned residents to prepare for fall winds that typically drive the state’s largest fires.
With more than 1.6 million acres blackened this year, climatologist Zach Zobel said California was on track to overtake the nearly 2 million acres burned in 2018, when the state suffered its deadliest wildfire and the most acreage burned in records going back to at least 1987.
""I would be very surprised if we didn't overtake that given the conditions in place,"" said Zobel an atmospheric scientist who tracks extreme weather for the Woodwell Climate Research Center. 
What worries climatologists is not so much the size of California's wildfires, which have long rejuvenated forests and chaparral, but their ferocity.
""It's Mother Nature injected with steroids"" Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said of events like the 14,000 lightning strikes to hit California since Aug. 15 due to what he believes is human impact on climate.
CLIMATE AND COLONIALISM
Higher temperatures in Northern California have created drier-than-normal vegetation and above-normal risk of rapid, extreme fires once offshore ""diablo"" winds begin mid September, the National Interagency Fire Center reported.
In the North Bay wine country, extreme wet and dry cycles allowed vegetation to grow back after 2017 fires and dry out enough to burn again this month rather than act as a natural fire break, according to firefighters.
“There’s definitely a climate change signal here, the weather temperatures are drying out the fuels,"" said Tim Brown, a professor at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nevada.
Human factors are also to blame.
A century of fire suppression to protect timber resources caused build up of the kind of fuel Native Americans long burned to rejuvenate forests, according to professor Dustin Mulvaney. 
Clear-cutting and regrowth created crowded, unhealthy forests with a lack of older trees that can survive fire, he said.
""That's not related to climate, that's about colonialism and kicking people off the land that managed that grove for 10,000 years before,"" said Mulvaney, a professor of environmental studies at San Jose State University. 
Species such as redwoods, which may have experienced fires four or five times over a 1,000-year life, may not withstand more intense blazes or recover during drought conditions, he said.
Extreme fires also burn more homes and infrastructure. 
A blaze in the redwoods of the Santa Cruz mountains destroyed nearly 800 structures as of Friday and may jeopardize reservoir water sources for the city of Santa Cruz.
Communities in Napa and Solano counties hit by 2017 fires have suffered the state’s second-largest blaze in history that destroyed 1,080 homes as of Friday, making it the tenth-most destructive on record.

""People who lost their houses last time are suddenly faced with losing them again after they rebuilt,"" said Sandy Chute, 76, a retiree as she evacuated her two horses to the Sonoma County Fairgrounds in Santa Rosa.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's president Sebastian Pinera on Friday insisted that truck drivers will not be allowed to block major highways while they strike to protest attacks on them in the country's restive Arauncania province. 
""We are not going to allow the taking of the highways or the interruption of the supply of food, medicine, ambulances, medical personnel or other goods,"" said Pinera.
He said officials were in intense dialogue with truckers unions on their second day of an ""indefinite"" protest over insecurity in Arauncania, and the slow track of security reforms through Congress. 
He appealed to legislators to ""get cracking"" on passing the reforms, but added that anyone endangering lives in the COVID-19 pandemic would be punished. 
His comments came after complaints that truck drivers were from Thursday able to assemble overnight when a military curfew was in force, and blockages on key highways raising fears of supply chain interruptions as the country struggles to get back in its feet after a peak of COVID infections. 
On Friday the blockages continued, though the government described these as ""sporadic."" 
Health minister Enrique Paris told a press conference on Friday he was ""very concerned"" after being told of ambulances being diverted and doctors unable to get to work. 
""I call on the truckers to free the way for health personnel, ambulances and trucks carrying medical equipment or medicines,"" he said. 
Chile`s Prosecutor` s Office said it had opened investigations into cases of blockages since the strike started on Thursday.
The Confederation of Chilean Cargo Transport (CNTC), leading the strike, insisted it would not cut supply chains but that wanted more ""concrete"" solutions from government.
Jose Villagran, the CNTC's vice-president, called for the government to declare a state of exception in Araucania. 
""The constitution permits the president to declare such when there is uncontrolled crime or terrorism and he has not done so,"" he said. 
The Araucania has seen a spike in attacks on transport trucks and factories in recent months. The south-central region of Chile has long been convulsed by a simmering conflict between the indigenous Mapuche and the Chilean government.

On Thursday, log cabins in a rural area outside the regional capital Temuco belonging to the parents of Fuad Chahin, the leader of Chile`s Christian Democrats party, were broken into a torched by a masked gang, Chahin said on social media.

The move coincides with reports of growing friction between Fayez al-Sarraj, Prime Minister of the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), and Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha, an influential figure from the port city and military power base of Misrata.
Bashagha, who was nominated in 2018, played a central role during a 14-month offensive on Tripoli by eastern-based forces that the GNA repelled in June with military support from Turkey. 
He is well regarded by the GNA's international backers, and had announced steps to rein in the armed groups that hold real power in Tripoli. Loud gunfire could be heard over central Tripoli shortly after the decision was announced.
A decree issued by Sarraj said Bashagha would be investigated by the GNA leadership within 72 hours, and his duties would be assumed by a deputy minister, Khalid Ahmad Mazen. A separate decree assigned a regional force headed by Osama Jweili, a commander from another militarily powerful city, Zintan, to help ensure security in Tripoli.
Since Sunday protests over worsening living conditions and corruption have escalated in Tripoli. Armed men have used gunfire to disperse demonstrators, and Serraj has imposed a 24-hour curfew for four days to counter the new coronavirus, a move seen by critics as a tactic for curbing the protests. 

There have long been tensions between armed groups from Tripoli and Misrata. Those from Misrata dominated the capital for several years after Libya split into rival factions based in the west and east of the country in 2014. They later lost their foothold to Tripoli-rooted groups.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Shinzo Abe on Friday said he was resigning because of poor health, ending a tenure as the country's longest-serving prime minister in which he sought to revive an economy stricken by deflation and push for a stronger military. 
His abrupt departure triggers a leadership battle in his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) over the next few weeks. The winner will likely stick to Abe's reflationary ""Abenomics"" policies that had mixed results in resuscitating the world's third-largest economy.
Abe has battled ulcerative colitis for years, and two recent hospital visits within a week had raised questions about whether he could stay on in until his term ends in September next year.
Despite the deepening concerns about his health, news of Abe's resignation sent tremors through Tokyo financial markets. Japan's main stock market, which has more than doubled under Abe, fell some 2% before recovering, while the yen rose on concerns of a return to deflation.
""I cannot continue being prime minister if I do not have the confidence that I can carry out the job entrusted to me by the people,"" Abe, 65, told a news conference as he announced his decision.
He said he wanted to avoid a political vacuum as Japan copes with the novel coronavirus. It was the second time Abe has resigned as prime minister because of poor health, the first more than a decade ago.
""I apologise from the bottom of my heart that despite all of the support from the Japanese people, I am leaving the post with one full year left in my term,"" he said.
At times during his news conference he choked up and blinked back tears.
Apart from inheriting an economy in the throes of its worst downturn since World War Two, Abe's successor will be left to try and ensure next year's Olympics - already delayed for a year by the COVID-19 pandemic - will go ahead.
Former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba and former foreign minister Fumio Kishida quickly expressed interest in the top job, media reported. Among others whose names have been floated is Abe's close aide, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.
""The broad picture remains intact. In terms of economic and fiscal policy, the focus remains very much on reflation,"" said Jesper Koll, senior adviser to asset manager WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF). ""Longevity will be a struggle.""
RECORD TENURE
The resignation comes just days after Abe surpassed a record for longest consecutive tenure as premier set by his great-uncle Eisaku Sato half a century ago.
But for all his longevity, he failed to deliver on one of his most prized goals - altering Japan's postwar, pacifist constitution. He also fell short of a full revival of the economy, even before the coronavirus.
""As head of the ruling party he worked hard on Abenomics for eight years,"" said Naohito Kojima, 55, a brokerage employee.
""There were various problems but if someone else had been leader, it's questionable whether they could have maintained a stable government as long as Mr Abe.""
Abe won praise for reasserting Japan's presence on the global stage after years of revolving-door premiers.
His resignation comes amid an uncertain geopolitical environment, including an intensifying confrontation between the United States and China. 
The conservative Abe returned as prime minister for a rare second term in December 2012, pledging to revive growth with his ""Abenomics"" mix of hyper-easy monetary policy, government spending and reforms. He also pledged to beef up Japan's defence and revise the constitution.
Abe was instrumental in winning the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.
""We must fulfil our responsibility as the host country of the Olympics,"" Abe told the news conference. ""Of course, I believe my successor will work to host the Olympics under the same belief.""
UNDER FIRE
Under fire for his handling of the coronavirus and scandals among party members, Abe has recently seen his support fall to one of the lowest levels since taking power in December 2012.
Japan has not suffered the explosive surge in virus cases seen elsewhere - it has had nearly 67,000 cases and 1,255 deaths - but Abe drew fire for a clumsy early response and what critics saw as a lack of leadership as infections spread. 
Abe kept his promises to boost spending on the military after years of declines and expanding its capacity to project power abroad. In a historic shift in 2014, his government reinterpreted the constitution to allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two.
A year later, Japan adopted laws scrapping a ban on exercising the right to defend a friendly country under attack.
But Abe proved unable to revise the U.S.-drafted, postwar constitution's pacifist Article 9, a personal mission that also eluded his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, who quit as premier in 1960 because of uproar over the U.S-Japan security pact he championed.

Abe resigned from his first stint as prime minister in 2007, citing ill-health after a year plagued by scandals in his cabinet and a huge election loss for his ruling party. He had since kept his illness in check with medicine that was not previously available.

The boat, named Louise Michel after a French feminist anarchist, has been operational since last week. On Thursday it rescued 89 people, including 14 women and four children, from a rubber boat in distress, the group said on its website. 
The 89 migrants are still onboard the boat and waiting for a safe port to disembark.
A former French Navy boat daubed in pink and white, the 30-metre long Louise Michel was bought with proceeds from the sale of Banksy artwork, the group said. The side of the vessel's cabin features an artwork of a girl holding a heart-shaped life buoy in his familiar stencilled style.
The group said the vessel was captained and crewed by a team of rescue professionals drawn from across Europe. 
A PR agent who works for Banksy declined to comment.
Banksy, a Bristol-born artist who keeps his identity a secret, is known for his political or social-commentary graffiti that has popped up in cities around the world. Last year one of his paintings depicting primates sitting in Britain's parliament sold for more than $12 million at auction.
Banksy has highlighted the plight of refugees and migrants in past works. 

In 2018, he painted walls in Paris with murals on the theme of migration, and in 2015, he sent fixtures from his temporary ""Dismaland"" theme park in western England to an informal migrant camp in Calais, northern France. Later the same year he created a mural of the late Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) founder Steve Jobs at the location.

(Reuters) - At least 40 dolphins have mysteriously died in an area of Mauritius affected by an oil spill from a Japanese boat, officials and witnesses said on Friday, as witnesses described the deaths of one mother dolphin and her baby.
Environmentalists have demanded an investigation into whether the dolphins were killed as a result of the spill from a Japanese ship, which was scuttled on Monday after running aground in July and leaking oil.
The death toll may rise: fisherman Yasfeer Heenaye said he saw between 25 and 30 apparently dead dolphins floating in the lagoon on Friday morning, among scores of the animals that fishermen were trying to herd away from the pollution. 
""There was a mother and her baby,"" he said. ""He was very tired, he didn't swim well. But the mum stayed alongside him, she didn't leave her baby to go with the group. All the way she stayed with him. She was trying to protect him."" 
He filmed as the calf wallowed on its side and died in front of them, floating on the waves. 
Heenaye, his boat running low on fuel, motioned to Reuben Pillay, who tracked the mother dolphin. She initially looked normal, he said. 
""But in a few minutes she went on her side, one fin in the water, and one out of the water and then she started flapping her tail really really rapidly,"" said Pillay, a professional drone operator and environmentalist who is providing video to Reuters. 
""She swam in circles in front of the boat, she moved her tail very violently and after about five minutes she just stopped moving, and she sunk ... We heard cries, I thought it was a woman on the boat - but they told me, no - it was the dolphin.""
The mother dolphin stopped moving and eventually slowly sank, tail first, beneath the waves. The dead baby floated on the surface.
""We didn't know what to do. It was heartwrenching,"" Pillay said. 
Earlier in the day, Jasvin Sok Appadu from the Mauritius fisheries ministry told Reuters that 38 carcasses had washed up on the beaches so far. 
Autopsy results on 25 dolphins that washed ashore Wednesday and Thursday are expected in the coming days, he said. 
So far veterinarians have examined only two of the dolphins, which bore signs of injury but no trace of hydrocarbons in their bodies, according to preliminary autopsy results. The autopsy on the first two was conducted by the government-run Albion Fisheries Research Centre.
The dolphins have been dying in an area affected by an oil spill caused when the Japanese ship, the MV Wakashio, struck a coral reef last month.
On Thursday, Greenpeace called on the government of Mauritius to launch an ""urgent investigation to determine the cause of the deaths and any ties to the Wakashio oil spill"".

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's former president Jacob Zuma, facing trial for graft, lashed out at his successor Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday, accusing him of betraying the ruling African National Congress (ANC) with his stance against corruption.
In an unprecedented attack, Zuma, whose decade in power was marked by multiple corruption scandals that are still being investigated, accused Ramaphosa of bringing the party into disrepute - a sign of growing divisions within the ANC ahead of its national executive committee conference this weekend.
Zuma himself faces multiple investigations for corruption, including a trial relating to a $2 billion arms deal before he took office in 2009, but he retains considerable support from a powerful faction within the ANC. He denies all charges. 
Ramaphosa has ordered investigations into reports of corruption in the government's COVID-19 response, including the diversion of funds meant for protective equipment for COVID-19 medics, as well as food handouts.
Many scandals have involved junior ANC members conspiring with family-owned businesses to defraud COVID-19 funds.
This week Ramaphosa wrote a letter to ANC members saying its ""leaders stand accused of corruption"" and that the ANC ""does stand as accused number one.""
Zuma, who has so far desisted from making explicit public attacks on his successor, said in response:
""You are the first president of the ANC to stand in public and accuse the ANC of criminality .... This is a devastating statement ... I view your letter as a diversion by which you accuse the entire ANC in order to save your own skin.""
Divisions within the ANC could make it harder for Ramaphosa - whose presidency has been dogged by opposition from factions in the party since he took office 2-1/2 years ago - to push through economic reforms needed to revive South Africa's struggling economy. 

Since taking power after winning its struggle against white minority rule in 1994, the ANC has been a broad coalition of groups whose disagreements often make it impossible to push through policies.

KYIV (Reuters) - Hasidic Jews arriving in Ukraine for an annual pilgrimage were stranded at airports on Friday after the government partially closed the border, a representative of the Rabbi Nachman International Charitable Foundation said.
Ukraine restricted the entry of foreign nationals to fight a recent spike in coronavirus cases and also partly in response to a request from Israel to prohibit travel to a pilgrimage site in Ukraine, fearing it could become a coronavirus hotspot. 
Tens of thousands of Hasidic Jews descend on the town of Uman every Jewish New Year to visit the grave of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, who revived the Hasidic movement and died in 1810. Jewish New Year celebrations run from Sept. 18-20 this year.
The head of Israel's coronavirus task force had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to ban the pilgrimage this year.
Irina Rybnitskaya of the Rabbi Nachman Foundation said hundreds had initially been stranded on Friday, although she later said some were being let through. 
""It seems they have begun to let them in. But not all of them,"" Rybnitskaya told Reuters. There was no kosher food available where they were kept, she added.
Andriy Demchenko, a spokesman for the border service, told Interfax Ukraine that dozens of Hasidic Jews had been stopped at airports this week as border guards could not confirm the purpose of their trip. 
""We do not make decisions on any discriminatory criteria. We make decisions that help protect the health of our citizens, regardless of their nationality, citizenship or religion,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Friday. 
Mikhail Tkach, Executive Director of the United Jewish Community of Ukraine, said the pilgrims had been warned in advance there could be problems on arrival. 
""I don't know what they were counting on, it's difficult to understand their logic,"" said Tkach.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that he had taken a tough stance over the summer with regard to Turkey's actions in the eastern Mediterranean, setting red lines because Ankara respects actions not words.
Relations between France and Turkey have soured in recent months over Ankara's role in NATO, Libya and the Mediterranean.
Macron has called for the EU to show solidarity with Greece and Cyprus in the dispute over natural gas reserves off Cyprus and the extent of their continental shelves and has pushed for further sanctions at EU level, although there are divisions in the bloc over the issue.
""When it comes to Mediterranean sovereignty, I have to be consistent in deeds and words,"" Macron told reporters at a news conference.
""I can tell you that the Turks only consider and respect that. If you say words that are not followed by acts...What France did this summer was important: it's a red line policy. I did it in Syria,"" he said referring to French air strikes against suspected chemical weapons sites in Syria.
France this week joined military exercises with Italy, Greece and Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean as the dispute between Turkey and Greece escalated after Ankara sent its Oruc Reis survey vessel to disputed waters this month, a move Athens has called illegal.
Macron said he had been firm, but restrained. 
""It was proportionate. We didn't send an armada,"" he said.
Macron has repeatedly demanded further EU sanctions against Turkey and the two NATO allies almost came to blows in June after a French warship attempted to inspect a Turkish vessel as part of a U.N. arms embargo for Libya.
""I don't consider that in recent years Turkey's strategy is the strategy of a NATO ally ... when you have a country which attacks the exclusive economic zones or the sovereignty of two members of the European Union,"" he said, describing Turkey's actions as provocations. 
""What would our credibility be in handling Belarus if we did not react to attacks on the sovereignty of our own members?""
Germany has sought a less confrontational approach, attempting to mediate between Ankara and Athens.
On Tuesday their respective foreign ministers said they wanted to solve the matter through dialogue following talks with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. However, each warned that they would continue to defend their rights in the region.

""Germany and other partners are beginning to agree with us that Turkey's agenda is problematic today,"" Macron said. ""When six months ago people were saying France is the only one blaming Turkey for things, everyone now sees that there is a problem.""

The leading opposition candidate, Tundu Lissu, said dozens of candidates from his party for both parliament and local councils had been disqualified for ""unfair reasons"".
""We had 3,754 local council candidates. ..we have lost 30 percent of them,"" he told crowds during a rally in Dar es Salaam as he called for peaceful demonstrations. 
Lissu said also that out of 244 candidates presented for Parliament, 53 had been disqualified and that he had demanded to the electoral commission to reinstate them. 
Lissu returned to Tanzania last month after spending nearly three years in Belgium for treatment after he was shot during an assassination attempt. 
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for Oct. 28.
Opposition parties are heading to the polls without a coalition or alliance that helped them gain more votes in the last election.
Tanzanian president John Magufuli, who has ruled the country since 2015, will face 14 challengers in the elections, with analysts saying a divided opposition is likely to ensure he will win a second term.
Another opposition party, Alliance for Transparency and Change (ACT-Wazalendo), also denounced on Friday that most of their candidates had been ""objected"".
The National Electoral Commission (NEC) did not respond to requests for comment.
Magufuli’s party has ruled Tanzania since independence in 1961. When he came to power in 2015 he promised to end corruption and develop the country's infrastructure. 
He has been accused by rights groups and opposition politicians of muzzling the press and intimidating political rivals ahead of October's vote, accusations the administration denies.

Here are highlights of his remarks at the news conference, held in a restaurant near the Eiffel Tower: 
LEBANON
""At this exceptional moment, (the situation) leads me to apply more pressure. I don't hold a trump card. I think that France has convinced its European and American partners and a good part of the regional partners that we are honest brokers.
NORD STREAM 2 GAS PIPELINE
""I don't think the approach that we ought to have with Russia should be one of naivety nor do I think it should be nourished by an increase in our dependence on Russia. This has always fuelled my reservations about the Nord Stream 2 project. The German chancellor (Angela Merkel) knows it."" 
CORONAVIRUS
""We are doing everything to avoid another lockdown and in particular a nationwide lockdown. We've learned enough to know that nothing can be ruled out. But we're doing everything to prevent it.
""What we must do is get people back to work.""
VIOLENCE
""Something is happening in our society which is not new and which has undoubtedly worsened since the end of (the coronavirus) lockdown, hardened, and which trivializes violence. The difficulty facing us is to respond as quickly as possible to all forms of violence.""
BELARUS
""Any external intervention in Belarus, starting with an intervention by Russian forces, whether military or internal security, would obviously be an intervention ... which would lead to the regionalization and internationalization of this issue. I think this intervention would be inappropriate.
""We want to engage Russia in a dialogue on Belarus, and for Russia to help us convince President (Alexander) Lukashenko of the need for OSCE mediation.""
HUAWEI 
""No company, whatever its nationality, is targeted.""
""(Our wish) while we have two European suppliers - Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) - is to have a real European industrial solution, fully secure, under our legislation because the security of our communications and the security of our 5G networks are at stake.""
Macron said he told Chinese President Xi Jinping: ""You would do the same as me at home"".
TURKEY AND TENSIONS IN EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
""It is my view that Turkey's strategy in recent years is not one of a NATO ally.
""Where would our credibility be in getting involved with Belarus if we do not react to challenges against the sovereignty of our own members?

""We consider that (Turkey's) deployments ... are a provocation. When it comes to Mediterranean sovereignty, I have to be consistent, in deeds as with words. And I can tell you that the Turks ... respect that.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A Chilean special forces captain has been arrested for assault in relation to an incident in which a woman was blinded by a tear gas canister during the massive social protests that rocked the country in 2019.
Fabiola Campillai, a trainee firefighter and mother of three children, was waiting for a bus to work in a southern suburb of the capital Santiago on Nov. 26 when she was hit in the face by a police-issue canister.
She was one of two Chileans left completely blind and more than 400 who suffered eye damage after being hit by projectiles fired during the sometimes violent protests over inequality that began in October last year and petered out with the arrival of the coronavirus in March this year. 
Earlier this month, two police officers were fired for failing to provide first aid to Campillai and, in one case, making false statements about what happened, according to police.
On Thursday night, investigators from the police Human Rights Squad detained one of the two officers, special forces captain Patricio Maturana. 
In a tweet, the prosecutor's office described him as ""the main defendant in relation to the serious injuries caused to a woman... that resulted in her total blindness.""
More than 30 people died, 3,000 were injured and 30,000 were arrested during the demonstrations, which drew criticism from several international human rights organizations who accused police of repetitive use of excessive force.
On Aug. 21, police lieutenant Colonel Claudio Crespo was detained for the total blinding of 22-year-old psychology student Gustavo Gatica.
Chile's National Human Rights Institute (INDH) had warned in March that the failure to bring officers to justice in both cases would cause further turmoil and mistrust of the police as the country approaches the anniversary of the outbreak of protests. 

INDH Director Sergio Micco welcomed Friday's detention but added: ""It could have all happened much quicker, the Chilean police can do more.""

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A court in Pakistan has sentenced to prison three leaders of Jamat-ud-Dawa, an organisation accused by India and the United States of masterminding the 2008 attacks in Mumbai.
The sentencing comes ahead of a September deadline for Pakistan to avoid being blacklisted for failing to curb terror financing by global financial watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). 
Inclusion on the blacklist, alongside Iran and North Korea, would mean being shunned by international financial institutions. The watchdog has called for Pakistan to prosecute those funding terrorism, as well as to enact laws to help track and stop terror financing.
Malik Zafar Iqbal and Abdul Salam were each handed 16-1/2 year total sentences on four charges, to be served concurrently, while a third man, Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki, got 1-1/2 years on one charge, according to a court judgment seen by Reuters. 
The men were associates of Hafiz Saeed, who was sentenced to a total of 11 years in prison in February. All the sentences are concurrent so Saeed, Iqbal and Salam will serve five years.
Saeed founded and led Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), or the Army of the Pure, a group blamed by India and the United States for the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which killed 160 people, including Americans and other foreigners.
Saeed and his associates also face a further slew of cases for allegedly financing militant activities, while Iqbal and Makki have already been convicted in several cases.
Saeed says his network, which spans 300 seminaries and schools, hospitals, a publishing house and ambulance services, has no ties to militant groups. Jamat-ud-Dawa funds the militant wing LeT.
A 2011 U.S. sanctions designation describes Iqbal as a co-founder of LeT and in charge of its financing activities. Salam is described as the interim leader of the group during the brief periods when Saeed was arrested in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks, and running its network of seminaries.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru will start testing coronavirus vaccines from China's Sinopharm and U.S. drugmaker Johnson & Johnson in September, researchers said, which should help the country gain faster access to inoculations once the vaccines are approved.
Sinopharm began this week to recruit up to 6,000 volunteers in Peru, which Reuters data indicates has the highest number of COVID-19 deaths in relation to its population size. A team of Chinese scientists is expected to arrive in the Andean nation next week to work with local researchers, said Germán Málaga, a doctor and lead vaccine investigator at Lima's Cayetano Heredia University.
""This is going to happen around Sept. 3, to begin vaccinations on Sept. 8,"" he said. Sinopharm's clinical trials in Peru are being done with Cayetano Heredia and the state-run Universidad Mayor de San Marcos.
Peru has recorded around 622,000 cases of the coronavirus, the fifth highest case load in the world, and 28,277 deaths. It now has the world's deadliest fatality rate per capita, with 86.67 deaths per 100,000 people, a Reuters tally shows, just ahead of Belgium.
Sinopharm will also do clinical coronavirus vaccine trials elsewhere in Latin America, including in Argentina.
Other Chinese laboratories that will be conducting trials in the region include Sinovac Biotech, which will work in Brazil and Chile, and Walvax Biotechnology Co Ltd and CanSino Biologics Inc, which will test in Mexico, authorities have said.
Johnson & Johnson's Janssen unit will start tests with some 4,000 volunteers in Peru around Sept. 24, Prime Minister Walter Martos told reporters on Thursday.
""We are contacting other companies, laboratories, from Britain and other countries that are going to help us immunize at least 70% of the local population,"" Martos said.
J&J said earlier this week that it would conduct Phase III trials for its vaccine in Chile, Argentina and Peru.
Peru, a country of nearly 33 million people and the world's no. 2 copper producer, has been particularly hard-hit by the pandemic, both in terms of infections and economic impact. The economy crumbled over 30% in the second quarter of the year.
The death toll could also be higher than official figures suggest. A national registry shows that between April and August there were 68,192 more deaths compared to the same period in 2019. Excess deaths often give a better indication of the true number of fatalities.
Researcher Málaga and Carlos Castillo, the chief adviser for immunizations and vaccines at Peru's health ministry, said that carrying out clinical trials would help Peru get faster access to vaccines when they were ready.

""There is an unwritten agreement, in the sense that in the country where a clinical trial is being carried out, it has priority access to vaccine availability,"" Castillo said.

MINSK/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, facing a nearly three-week popular uprising since a disputed election, threatened on Friday to cut off European transit routes across his country if sanctions are imposed.
Speaking during a visit to a dairy factory in the country's east, Lukashenko said he would block European neighbours from shipping goods to Russia over Belarusian territory, and divert exports now shipped through ports in EU member Lithuania.
""They got fat and forgot what Belarus is. And thought we could be frightened off with rockets and tanks,"" Belta state news agency quoted him as saying. ""Well let's see who is afraid of whom. We'll show them what sanctions are.""
Goods from landlocked Belarus account for almost a third of Lithuania's rail traffic and port volume. Belarus is also a major overland route for European goods bound for Russia, and carries pipelines used to ship Russian oil to Europe.
Lukashenko denies opposition accusations that he rigged an Aug. 9 election to prolong his 26-year rule. Thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand he step down. He says the protesters are funded by the West, and accuses NATO of massing forces on Belarusian frontiers, which the alliance denies.
Lukashenko said he had ordered half the army to enter combat preparedness, and had agreed with Russian President Vladimir Putin that their troops could unite in the event of a threat from the West. 
""If they (NATO troops) don't hold still, it's necessary to use a joint grouping of armed forces, the basis of which is the Belarusian army,"" Lukashenko said. ""The Russians must support us and follow us.""
Neighbouring Lithuania, Poland and Latvia have pushed for Europe to take stronger action against Lukashenko. Lithuania has also angered Lukashenko by hosting opposition presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled there after the vote that her supporters say she won.
""The president supports effective sanctions on Belarus, at European, regional and national levels. They are used as an answer to violence of government institutions and human rights violations in the country,"" Lithuanian presidential spokesman Antanas Bubnelis said on Friday.
Belarus is Russia's closest ex-Soviet ally and its territory is an integral part of Moscow's European defence strategy. Nevertheless, Lukashenko is seen in Moscow as a truculent friend, and the Kremlin must decide whether to stick with him.
In the biggest sign yet of Russia's willingness to intervene to prop up Lukashenko, Putin said on Thursday the Kremlin had set up a ""reserve police force"" at Lukashenko's request, although it would be deployed only if necessary.
Speaking on Friday about the Russian force, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hoped ""such troops are not deployed"".

The West has so far acted cautiously, balancing its sympathy for a nascent Belarusian pro-democracy movement with its concern over provoking intervention from Russia. EU foreign ministers on Thursday discussed sanctions against up to 20 Belarusians they blame for election fraud and cracking down on protesters.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - The baby dolphin rolled over on its side, floating on the surface. Its mother repeatedly nudged its head above the oily waves in a lagoon in Mauritius, where environmentalists are demanding an investigation into the deaths of dozens of dolphins following an oil spill.
The footage - obtained by Reuters from a fisherman who tried to help rescue the dolphins - showed the last desperate moments of the mother and her calf before they both died.
At least 40 dolphins have been found dead in Mauritius - 38 who washed ashore, as well as the mother and her baby - since Monday, when a Japanese ship was scuttled after running aground in July and leaking oil. [L8N2FU3IU]
The death toll may rise: Yasfeen Heenaye, the 31-year-old fisherman who filmed the mother and baby, said he saw nearly 200 dolphins inside the reef Friday morning, 25-30 of them dead. 
""Some were injured and some were just floating,"" Heenaye said. Fishermen were trying to herd the dolphins out of the lagoon into the open seas.
""Inside the reef there is oil spill on the water - if they stay inside maybe all of them will die - but if they go outside maybe they will survive. We were trying to push the dolphins outside the reef, making noise in the boat to make the dolphins go outside the reef,"" he said. 
""There was a mother and her baby. ...He was very tired, he didn't swim well. But the mum stayed alongside him, she didn't leave her baby to go with the group. All the way she stayed with him. She was trying to protect him ...to push the baby to get back with the group.""
But the baby wallowed on its side and died in front of them, floating on the waves, he said. 
""When I was seeing this, there was tears in my eyes. I am a parent of a little daughter, it is very difficult for me to see the mother struggle and try her best to save her baby,"" Heenaye said.

Ronan Hughes appeared at the Old Bailey court following the discovery of the bodies in October, in a case that shocked Britain and Vietnam and shone a light on the illicit human smuggling trade. 
Thirty-one of the victims were men or boys, and eight were women. The oldest was 44 and three were aged under 18, including two 15-year-old boys.
Most were from Nghe An and Ha Tinh provinces in north-central Vietnam, where poor job prospects, environmental disasters and the promise of financial reward fuel migration.
Hughes also admitted conspiring to assist unlawful immigration.
The driver of the truck when it was found on an industrial estate in Essex to the east of London - Maurice Robinson from northern Ireland - had already pleaded guilty to manslaughter charges.

Seventeen people were killed during three days of bloodshed that marked the beginning of a wave of Islamist violence that was to leave scores more dead.
On Jan. 7, 2015, brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi went on a gun rampage in the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a weekly whose cartoons on race, religion and politics tested the limits of what society would accept in the name of free speech. They killed 12 people.
The following day, Amedy Coulibaly, an acquaintance of Cherif Kouachi killed a female police officer. On Jan. 9 he killed four Jewish men at a kosher supermarket in eastern Paris.
The three attackers were killed by police in separate standoffs.
In a video recording, Coulibaly said the attacks were coordinated and carried out in the name of Islamic State. The Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabic Peninsula claimed the Charlie Hebdo attack.
Zineb el Rhazoui, 38, who quit her job as a journalist at Charlie Hebdo two years after the attack, said she hoped her slain colleagues would be remembered as gentle, cultured human beings.
""If (the attackers) committed this butchery, it is because they believed in an ideology and this ideology will have to be put on trial. That's what I'm waiting for,"" she told Reuters.
The alleged accomplices have been charged with crimes including supplying weapons, membership of a terrorist organisation and financing terrorism.
Of the 14 defendants, three will be tried in absentia and may be dead. Hayat Boumedienne, Coulibaly's partner at the time of the attack, and brothers Mohamed and Mehdi Belhoucine are believed to have travelled to areas of Syria under the control of Islamic State just before the attacks.
Among those in the dock will be Ali Riza Polat who investigators allege helped the three attackers amass their weapons and munitions. He faces life in jail if found guilty.

The hydrogen bomb, which carried the force of 50 million tons of conventional explosives, was detonated in a test in October 1961, 4,000 metres over the remote Novaya Zemlya archipelago above the Arctic Circle.
The footage shows an immense fireball and a 60-km high mushroom cloud rising after the explosion lit up the sky. The views were captured from several angles by cameras installed on the ground and on board two Soviet aircraft. 
""The testing of an exceptionally powerful hydrogen load ... confirmed that the Soviet Union is in possession of a thermo-nuclear weapon with power of 50 megatons, 100 megatons and more,"" a narrator tells the audience.

Developed between 1956 and 1961 as the Soviet Union engaged in a nuclear arms race with the United States, the Tsar Bomba - the King of Bombs - was the largest hydrogen bomb ever and was claimed to be 3,300 times as destructive as the weapon that levelled Hiroshima.
The 30-minute film, which opens with a 'Top secret' title, features all the test stages - from transportation of a 26-ton weapon in an aviation bomb casing by railway, to post-explosion measurements of the radioactive fallout.

The Tsar Bomba far surpassed the largest explosion the United States has ever conducted - a 15-megaton ""Castle Bravo"" hydrogen bomb detonated on Bikini Atoll in 1954.

LAKE CHARLES, La. (Reuters) - Hurricane Laura tore through Louisiana on Thursday, killing six people and flattening buildings across a wide swatch of the state before moving into Arkansas with heavy rains. 
Laura's powerful gusts uprooted trees - and four people were crushed to death in separate incidents of trees falling on homes. The state's department of health said late Thursday that there were two more fatalities attributed to the hurricane - a man who drowned while aboard a sinking boat and a man who had carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a generator in his home. 
In Westlake, a chemical plant caught fire when hit by Laura, and the flames continued to send a chlorine-infused plume of smoke skyward nearly 24 hours after landfall.
Laura caused less mayhem than forecasts predicted - but officials said it remained a dangerous storm and that it would take days to assess the damage. At least 867,000 homes and businesses in Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas remained without power on Thursday afternoon.
""This was the most powerful storm to ever make landfall in Louisiana,"" Governor John Bel Edwards told a news conference. ""It's continuing to cause damage and life-threatening conditions."" 
Laura's maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph) upon landfall easily bested Hurricane Katrina, which sparked deadly levee breaches in New Orleans in 2005, and arrived with wind speeds of 125 mph. 
The NHC said Laura's eye had crossed into southern Arkansas late Thursday afternoon and was heading to the northeast at 15 mph (24 kph). The storm could dump 7 inches (178 mm) of rain on portions of Arkansas, likely causing flash floods. 
Laura was downgraded to a tropical depression by the NHC at 10 p.m., and the forecaster said it will move to the mid-Mississippi Valley later on Friday and then to the mid-Atlantic states on Saturday.
CHEMICAL PLUME
Laura's howling winds leveled buildings across a wide swath of the state and a wall of water that was 15 feet (4.6 m) high crashed into tiny Cameron, Louisiana, where the hurricane made landfall around 1 a.m. 
A calamitous 20-foot storm surge that had been forecast to move 40 miles (64 km) inland was avoided when Laura tacked east just before landfall, Edwards said. That meant a mighty gush of water was not fully pushed up the Calcasieu Ship Channel, which would have given the storm surge an easy path far inland. 
Tropical-force winds were felt in nearly every parish across Louisiana - and Edwards warned that the death toll could climb as search and rescue missions increase. 
CLEANUP BEGINS 
Residents of Lake Charles heard Laura's winds and the sound of breaking glass as the storm passed through the city of 78,000 with winds of 85 mph and gusts up to 128 mph in the hour after landfall.
National Guard troops cleared debris from roads in Lake Charles on Thursday afternoon. There were downed power lines in streets around the city, and the winds tipped a few semi-trucks onto their sides. 
The windows of the city's 22-storey Capital One Tower were blown out, street signs were toppled and pieces of wooden fence and debris from collapsed buildings lay scattered in the flooded streets, video footage on Twitter and Snapchat showed. 
Lake Charles resident Borden Wilson, a 33-year-old pediatrician, was anxious about his return home after evacuating to Minden, Louisiana.

""I never even boarded up my windows. I didn't think to do that. This is the first hurricane I've experienced. I just hope my house is fine,"" he said in a telephone interview.

Scores of activists removed a steel barricade as they tried to move closer to the Samranrat police station, where the leaders had gone to answer summonses.
They faced multiple charges including violating article 116, which covers sedition, and breaching coronavirus restrictions on public gatherings.
""Please don't do this, we are looking after the situation,"" police said over loudspeakers as activists pushed through metal fences. 
One threw a bucket of paint, covering an officer in blue. 
Demonstrators have returned to Thailand's streets to call for the removal of the government of 2014 coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha after a disputed election last year, reviving memories of more than a decade of unrest prior to the coup.
""This fight has to end with our generation,"" one activist at Friday's protest said.
The situation eased when the authorities agreed to have the group move closer to the building and hold a small rally.
Prime Minister Prayuth said on Wednesday the country would be ""engulfed in flames"" if the situation persisted, his most serious warning yet.
Thailand has seen a month of near-daily rallies led by students calling for his removal, a new constitution and a new election, with some drawing more than 10,000 protesters.

Other protesters have vowed to move ahead with a planned demonstration on Sept. 19, the anniversary of an earlier military coup in 2006 and a pro-government protest is planned for this Sunday.

1691,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",Deadly firefight in Lebanon prompts warnings of more trouble,"By Michael Georgy
KHALDEH, Lebanon (Reuters) - A deadly battle between Lebanese Sunnis and Shi'ites overnight prompted warnings of more violence as the country is pushed to breaking point by a financial meltdown and political tensions.
Two people - a 13-year-old Lebanese Sunni boy and a Syrian man - were killed in the Khaldeh area south of the capital in the shootout on Thursday night. 
Machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades were used in the fighting which witnesses said lasted four hours.
A Sunni Arab tribe to which the boy belonged accused members of the powerful, Iran-backed Shi’ite group Hezbollah of opening fire. Hezbollah categorically denied having anything to do with the incident.
The Lebanese army, which was heavily deployed in the area on Friday, said the problem spiralled out of a row over a poster put up by Shi’ites to commemorate Ashura, the 7th century martyrdom of Imam Hussein. 
The army statement said the problem that erupted was between members of the Arab Khaldeh tribes and residents of the area, without identifying them.
The violence triggered a flurry of contacts among Lebanese politicians seeking to contain tensions. The country is still grappling with the aftermath of the Aug. 4 port blast which killed 180 people and the financial crisis seen as the biggest threat to stability since the 1975-90 civil war. 
Mourners chanted ""there is no God but God and Hezbollah is the enemy of God"" as the boy’s body was carried on a stretcher into his grandfather's house at funeral on Friday.
Men in facemasks fired AK-47s in the air.
Divisions between Lebanese Sunnis and Shi'ites opened up after the 2005 assassination of Rafik al-Hariri, the former prime minister. Rifts emerged again after a U.N.-backed tribunal recently convicted a Hezbollah commander, Salim Ayyash, of conspiracy to kill him.
Hezbollah denies any role in killing Hariri, Lebanon’s main Sunni leader at the time of his death. 
A building set on fire during the fighting was still smouldering and its windows were peppered with bullet holes.
“We (will) take our rights with our own hands,” Riad Zaher, the tribe’s leader, said. He expressed doubt the authorities would bring anyone to justice. “We know that the government will take them in one door and let them out the other,"" he said.
Denying any Hezbollah link to the incident, a spokesman for the group referred to the army statement and said “throwing around accusations recklessly is totally rejected.” 
""This is not the truth that security apparatus know and the people of the area know,"" Mohammad Afif, the spokesman, said.
Located on the highway to the south, the Khaldeh area is home to Sunnis, Shi'ites and Druze. 
DISMANTLING THE STATE
Ali al-Shahine, a spokesman for the Arab Khaldeh tribes, accused Hezbollah supporters of recently trying to put up a picture of Ayyash. 
A military source and Hezbollah denied this had happened. 
After the tribunal's ruling, people in Ayyash's village briefly put up a picture of him. Hezbollah told them to remove it to ease tensions, a member of the group said. 
The Future Movement led by Hariri’s son, Saad, urged the Arab Khaldeh tribes to heed his call for self-restraint and said the incident was the result of “unregulated weapons and futile provocations”.
It is the second deadly shooting in a week. 
Three men were shot dead in the village of Kaftoun in northern Lebanon on Saturday. A Syrian man has been arrested and two Lebanese suspects are on the run over that incident, a security source said.
“The sporadic rise of violence is another sign of the dismantling of the state,” said Mustafa Alloush, a Future Movement leader. “I expect that similar or other types of violence will rise from now on,” he told Reuters.
Al-Akhbar, a pro-Hezbollah newspaper, said political tensions had started to spill into the street.
“The ‘battle’ of Khaldeh ... gave a clear indication that the game in the street will quickly go out of control to burn the whole country,” it said.

1692,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 08:27AM ET</span>","Where state is weak, Mali militants broker talks between rival clans","By Aaron Ross
DAKAR (Reuters) - A few weeks before military officers overthrew Mali's government in a bloodless coup, a series of meetings in the remote centre of the country underscored how much the state's grip on power had loosened.
Video of one gathering in the rural commune of Sangha shows leaders from the rival Dogon and Fulani communities, whose militias have slaughtered hundreds of civilians in tit-for-tat attacks this year, sitting down together and making peace.
Also surprising were the mediators: fighters from al Qaeda's Mali affiliate, who can be seen squatting in the shade with rifles and ammunition belts, many of their faces obscured by turbans and dark sunglasses.
Until recently, members of the al Qaeda-linked Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) - Mali's most powerful militant group - had sided with the semi-nomadic Fulani herdsmen when they clashed with the Dogon people over land and resources.
But flush with new recruits and weapons captured from overwhelmed state forces, the jihadists have turned to mediation in a bid to further entrench their local control, said Idrissa Sankare, a former member of parliament from the area.
""They want to have a territorial presence,"" he said. ""If the population is with them, they won't denounce them to the army.""
In the sparsely populated, semi-arid lands northeast of the capital Bamako plagued by violence and insecurity, some local people welcome the intervention, which began in July.
Whether it is enough to end ethnic bloodshed altogether remains to be seen.
Dozens of attacks by Dogon and Fulani militias killed more than 350 people in the first half of the year, and attacks by Islamist extremists killed dozens more, the United Nations' human rights office in Mali said this month.
It is the kind of violence that former colonial power France wanted to squash when its military intervened in northern Mali in 2013. Since then al Qaeda-linked fighters have expanded into central Mali and neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso.
Mali's army has been pulling out of some hotspots - part of what commanders describe as a new ""operational posture"" in the face of Islamist attacks - and civil administrators lack the resources to provide basic services, two officials from the central Mali region of Mopti said.
Western and regional officials fear the overthrow of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita last week could further strengthen the militants' hand.
After a previous coup in 2012, al Qaeda-linked insurgents took advantage of a power vacuum to seize Mali's desert north and start advancing on the capital Bamako.
NO STATE PRESENCE
There were no state representatives at the July 27 talks in Sangha, said a local official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for safety reasons. The official verified the authenticity of the video, which Reuters has seen.
In it, a village leader warmly welcomes Dogon farmers and Fulani herders, even though their longstanding rivalry over land and resources has escalated dramatically in recent years, fuelled by what the United Nations says is deliberate incitement by Islamist militants aimed at boosting recruitment.
""I salute you and ask God to bless this meeting,"" says the leader, a Dogon, drawing his hands together as he sits in the dirt opposite the militants.
""The people of Sangha have called for reconciliation in the name of our blood bonds so that we can find peace again.""
JNIM has not publicly commented on the meetings and any role in reconciling rival ethnic groups.
Spokesmen for the presidency and the army did not respond to requests for comment on the jihadists' recent intervention in rural Mali before the military takeover.
A spokesman for the new junta said officers were not immediately available to answer questions about them.
The meeting last month was one of several that al Qaeda-linked fighters have organised since late July in Mopti, leading to deals between rival groups that have allowed people from dozens of villages to return to fields and markets without fear of attack, four local officials told Reuters.
The militants' role is a reminder that, in spite of the French-backed military campaign that initially inflicted heavy casualties on groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State, their influence is growing.
""People are tired. There's no state,"" said the official who had knowledge of the Sangha meeting. ""I prefer a bad negotiation, a bad agreement, over heading to our deaths.""
'TIRED OF WAR'
Informal talks between community leaders and JNIM about exploring the idea of reconciling warring clans began several months ago, the local officials said.
The militants told villagers their problem was with the government, not civilians, according to the officials. Feeling defenceless, villagers embraced the peace offering.
Videos from Sangha and other meetings - some mediated by the jihadists, others not - show Fulani and Dogon men shaking hands, laughing and praying together. Local officials confirmed the authenticity of the videos.
""Everyone is tired of this war,"" said Marcelin Guenguere, who was a senior member of the Dogon militia Dan Na Ambassagou before being elected to parliament in April. ""We think that dialogue alone is the solution."" 
Rida Lyammouri, a senior fellow at the Policy Center for the New South in Morocco, said the jihadists could be looking to bolster their negotiating position after the government said it was prepared to enter talks with JNIM.
He also said JNIM had fought a series of battles with fighters from Islamic State, which also has an affiliate in the region, since last year, reflecting a falling out between two groups that had largely avoided confrontation until then.
Islamic State, which has imposed a brutal interpretation of Sharia in areas it controls, sees JNIM as too moderate, Lyammouri added.
According to local officials, JNIM militants have not imposed the kind of draconian religious justice, such as cutting off the hands of suspected thieves, that gained al Qaeda fighters notoriety during their 2012 occupation of northern Mali.
Sankare, the former member of parliament, said some militants had initially pressured people to stop listening to music and drinking alcohol, but their strategy appeared to have changed.

""It seems they received instructions from their leadership to go preach the Sharia in the mosques and villages without coercion,"" he said.

There were no reports of casualties on either side. The United Nations' Middle East envoy urged Israel and Gaza militants to halt the violence. 
Israel's military said it struck underground infrastructure and a military post belonging to Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas overnight in response to incendiary balloons launched from the Palestinian enclave that have burned Israeli farmland. 
Gaza militants then fired six rockets towards Israel, the military said, drawing a second round of Israeli strikes which hit a Hamas armed training camp. 
An Israeli military spokesman said he did not have any information on where the Gaza rockets landed, but that none of them were intercepted by its Iron Dome system. 
Hamas has been trying to pressure Israel to ease its blockade of Gaza and allow more investment, in part by letting Palestinians launch dozens of helium balloons carrying incendiary material towards southern Israel in recent weeks.
With tension high, Israel has closed its only commercial crossing with Gaza, banned sea access and halted fuel imports into the Mediterranean coastal strip, leading to its only power plant shutting down last week.
""Militants continue to launch projectiles and incendiary devices. The tightening of closures is making life inside the Strip unbearable,"" U.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov said on Twitter. 
""Under the current circumstances no mediation efforts to prevent escalation & improve the situation can succeed."" 
Mediators from the United Nations, Egypt and Qatar have been working to restore calm. Qatari envoy Mohammad Al-Emadi has been in Gaza since Tuesday holding talks with Hamas leaders.
Israel has struck Hamas facilities almost nightly for the past two weeks, saying it would not tolerate the balloons.
Health officials have voiced concern that the power plant shutdown could aggravate a novel coronavirus outbreak in impoverished Gaza, which is home to 2 million Palestinians.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Police sealed off parts of Indian Kashmir's main city Srinagar on Friday to stop Shi'ite Muslims from staging processions during their mourning month of Muharram and detained at least 50 attendees, police said.
Citing coronavirus fears, authorities have banned Muharram gatherings where worshippers flog themselves with steel-tipped flails or slash their bodies with knives to mourn the death of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Mohammad.
Shi'ite crowds tried to gather in parts of Srinagar, the main city of Indian Kashmir, but some were thwarted by police roadblocks and by officers searching vehicles and others chanting slogans were chased down by police.
""At least 50 mourners were detained in Srinagar who defied the restrictions,"" a police officer said. Some scuffled with police before they were taken away.
Kashmir is already under heavy security since last year when the federal government revoked its special status and statehood, causing anger in the revolt-torn Muslim majority region.
""There is usually procession on Muharram but they have put a lot of restrictions this year. All the roads are shut near Lal Chowk (Red Square) ... There are no public transports and shops are also shut. It feels like a curfew,"" a resident who gave his name as Mohammad said.
Police and witnesses said some people taking part in the Muharram processions on the outskirts of Srinagar shouted anti-India slogans earlier in the week.
Protests by Kashmir's 1.4 million Shi'ite Muslims are rare. The 31-year revolt against Indian rule in the territory has been led by Sunni Muslim militants. 
But this year, Shi'ite youths have been vocal about alleged human rights violations by Indian security forces, said senior Shi’ite leader Maulana Masroor Abbas Ansari. 
Kashmir valley's police chief Vijay Kumar said two people had been detained for anti-India slogans during the Muharram processions earlier in the week. 

""We will book and act against all those people who have taken part in such processions at other places”, Kumar said.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>","Detained Colombia businessman was negotiating with Iran for Venezuela, lawyers say","By Angus Berwick
(Reuters) - A Colombian businessman detained in Cape Verde in June was on a mission to Iran as a special envoy of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to negotiate fuel and humanitarian supplies at the time of his arrest, his lawyers told Reuters.
Authorities in Cape Verde detained Alex Saab when his private jet stopped to refuel just after 8 p.m. on June 12, acting on an international arrest warrant for money laundering charges filed last year in the United States.
U.S. prosecutors accuse Saab of bribing Venezuelan officials to take advantage of the state-controlled exchange rate and transferring $350 million in illegally obtained funds to overseas accounts.
Saab, who remains in a Cape Verde jail as he fights extradition to the United States, has denied the charges. His lawyers have called the U.S. charges ""politically motivated."" 
The Madrid-based law firm representing Saab in Cape Verde exclusively provided Reuters with details of his Iran visits and relationship with the Maduro government, along with an account of his arrest.
""Special Envoy Saab is the key figure for the U.S. in their plan to overthrow Nicolas Maduro and keep suffocating the Venezuelan people,"" said a statement from Saab's defense team, led by former Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon.
Saab's lawyers said he made an earlier visit to Iran in April, when he persuaded Iranian officials to send oil tankers loaded with gasoline along with planes carrying refinery materials, to Venezuela to ease a fuel shortage crisis. 
He also secured medical supplies and food to help Venezuela prepare for the coronavirus pandemic, which threatened to overrun the country's decrepit health system, the lawyers said.
Asked about U.S. officials' comments that Caracas paid Tehran in gold for the shipments, Saab's lawyers said the items were ""paid for along standard international terms of trade using Venezuela's own resources.""
Washington has imposed tough sanctions on trade in Venezuelan oil and gold in recent years in an effort to remove Maduro, whose 2018 reelection was widely considered a sham. The United States has also put sanctions on Iran. 
Venezuela's government, which said after Saab's arrest that he was acting as its ""agent"" to secure humanitarian supplies for the coronavirus pandemic, did not respond to requests for comment.
Saab's legal team is appealing a decision by a Cape Verde court to extradite him, arguing that he has diplomatic immunity and would not face a fair trial in the United States due to ""illegal evidence.""
In a letter Saab wrote to Cape Verde's prime minister earlier in August, he said Venezuela would offer his government ""more opportunities"" if authorities there released him. ""I can help Cape Verde more than the United States will do in 100 years,"" Saab wrote in the letter, seen by Reuters.
Saab's arrest was a dramatic turn for the man who had risen from a textile company owner in Colombia to become a powerful intermediary for the Venezuelan government, considered a dictatorship by most Western nations. 
As the Trump administration tightened sanctions, Saab has leveraged his international contacts to help Maduro barter his remaining resources to obtain aid from allies like Iran.
Saab's relationship with the Venezuelan government began in 2011, when he secured a contract to build public housing, his lawyers said. The U.S. indictment against Saab alleges he made ""corrupt payments"" in connection with this deal. 
In 2018, Maduro named Saab a special envoy to ""collaborate"" with foreign governments ""to find solutions to Venezuela's complex situation,"" his lawyers said. 
When the coronavirus pandemic began spreading through Latin America early this year, the lawyers said Venezuela's foreign ministry entrusted Saab with ""the responsibility of acquiring greatly needed humanitarian resources.""
During his April visit to Iran, Saab told Iranian officials that Venezuela needed shipments of gasoline, as U.S. sanctions had restricted the Maduro government's ability to import material needed to produce it. 
The Iranians agreed to send eight oil tankers, along with 16 flights coordinated by Iran's Mahan Air, his lawyers said.  
Iran's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Flight tracking services showed 16 Mahan Air flights arriving in Venezuela in late April and May. At the time, a senior PDVSA official said the flights were bringing chemicals needed in the refining process to make gasoline.
Iran also sent five tankers carrying gasoline to Venezuela starting in May, which helped to ease temporarily the scarcity of gasoline. However, the United States this month seized four cargoes of Iranian fuel bound for Venezuela, where fuel shortages are once again worsening.
A top Iranian official involved in the talks for these shipments told Reuters the Mahan Air planes returned to Iran with gold bars worth $200 million as part of the ""trade.""
In April, some 7 tonnes of gold was withdrawn from Venezuela's central bank, people familiar with the operations said, though they did not know its destination. The Maduro government has repeatedly sold off its gold reserves in recent years to obtain valuable foreign currency.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 08:16AM ET</span>",Special Report: One Brazilian farmer tried – and failed – to ranch more responsibly in the Amazon,"By Stephen Eisenhammer
TAILANDIA, Brazil (Reuters) - Mauro Lucio Costa wanted to do the right thing for the world's largest rainforest. 
For decades, the third-generation rancher in northern Brazil watched guiltily as his industry, feeding soaring global appetite for beef, razed ever more jungle. So, gradually he experimented with grasses and grazing techniques that today make his ranch one of the most efficient in Brazil. Costa became a model for those who believe beef can be raised profitably and sustainably – even in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
As a so-called ""finishing farm,"" Costa's ranch is the last stop cattle make in a chain that begins with breeders and often includes stays on a progression of other properties before animals are grown and ready for slaughter. 
Eager to do more – and push others in the industry toward sustainability, too – Costa in 2017 decided to buy cattle only from breeders who could prove they weren't ranching illegally cleared land. He asked a consultant to check suppliers' farms for deforestation using satellite maps and a government list of embargoed properties.
After only a year, though, his effort failed.
Nearly half his cattle, Costa realized, came from suppliers who either had environmental violations or whose land titles and other paperwork were so questionable that he couldn't be sure. To see his plan through, he said, he would have been unable to keep his herd populated and produce enough beef to make a profit. 
""I can't sabotage my business for something no one else does,"" Costa told Reuters, surrounded by pastures framed by towering rainforest. A wide-brimmed Resistol hat, a souvenir from trips to Texas, shielded his face from the tropical sun. His embossed belt buckle, also Texan, shone with his name and that of his ranch – Marupiara, an indigenous term that loosely means ""place of happy hunting.""
The admission, from a rancher so ""green"" he addressed attendees of a United Nations climate gathering last year, illustrates the hurdles to responsible development in the Amazon jungle. 
Costa's effort was entangled by snags that have long hindered order in the vast, unruly region – from lax land registries to weak law enforcement to the opaque workings of Brazil's beef business, in which cattle, with little or no tracking by government or industry, are reared and fattened on a succession of ranches. 
It can be impossible for ranchers like Costa to know for certain where their animals hail from. 
In many other major producers, like the United States, cattle move around less, living longer on single ranches and subsisting more on grains and prepared feeds. But Brazil's cattle remain mostly grass-fed, using more pasture and leading ranches to specialize in particular stages of the animals' growth. 
While Brazilian law in theory makes it a crime to raise beef on illegally cleared woodland, few mechanisms exist to help buyers identify cattle's origins. Livestock, like money, are often laundered, passing from pastures that violate environmental laws, into the legal supply chain, and on to supermarkets and dinner tables worldwide. 
""There is a huge hole in the system,"" said Paulo Barreto, one of Brazil's leading researchers on land use in the Amazon. ""No meat processor can say their cattle are deforestation-free.""
The Amazon, a jungle larger than Western Europe, is a crucial natural bulwark against climate change. It's a major source of the world's oxygen and fresh water, its vegetation a giant filter for greenhouse gases. 
Although more than 80% of the original Amazon still stands, deforestation has accelerated in recent years as loggers, soy farmers and cattle ranchers, spurred by ravenous global demand, hack and burn deeper into the rainforest.
In addition to market forces fueling the devastation, President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right populist, has reversed policies that prevented deforestation, slashing budgets of agencies that for decades fought unauthorized clearing.
Emboldened by the changes, Brazilians last year felled and burned rainforest equivalent in size to Lebanon, the largest clearing in more than a decade. This year, data suggest deforestation and fires in the Amazon continue apace. 
International outrage is mounting. 
VF Corp (NYSE:VFC), the U.S. company that owns apparel brands including Vans, Timberland, and The North Face, said last year it would stop buying Brazilian leather. In May, British supermarkets threatened to boycott Brazilian products. In June, a group of major European investors said it was considering divesting its Brazilian holdings, including government bonds, if Bolsonaro doesn't change course. 
He has paid little heed. 
Ricardo Salles, Bolsonaro's environment minister, in April suggested that Brazil take advantage of the world's distraction with coronavirus to accelerate deregulation of forestry laws. ""We need to make an effort,"" he said in a video of a cabinet meeting, ""to push everything through, change it all, simplify norms."" 
Last year, after a climate conference in Madrid, he tweeted a photo of a large, rare steak, joking that he was offsetting the meeting's carbon emissions with ""a veggie lunch."" When challenged by lawmakers, environmental activists, and Brazilian media about his comments at the cabinet meeting, Salles in a statement said he had always supported deregulation ""with good sense"" and ""within the law."" 
The ministry declined a Reuters request for further comment.
Once confined largely to the rolling pastures of Brazil's temperate south, ranchers have used genetic advances to breed cattle that better weather equatorial heat. 
In recent decades, ranchers pushed into the tropics, breeding the world's largest beef herd, now with some 215 million animals. They also became the top exporters of beef, controlling about 20% of the global export market and selling almost 2 million tons of the meat annually to countries as far afield as China, Russia and Egypt. 
A handful of Brazilian multinationals, including  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY), Minerva SA (OTC:MRVSY), and Marfrig Global Foods SA, ship most of those exports. But those meatpackers, from whom major retailers buy their beef, get the meat from a large and disparate array of suppliers, from small family farms to more sophisticated ranchers like Costa. 
The Brazilian industry is recognized globally for strict sanitary policies and high-quality meat, but it has struggled to comply with its own nation's forestry laws. 
In 2009, Brazilian prosecutors threatened to identify and prosecute companies buying beef from illegal pastures. The big meatpackers, in response, started using satellite imagery and data to better track suppliers. 
Deforestation slowed. 
But the data only showed the land farmed by the immediate seller – not pastures where cattle grazed previously. Because there is no unified system to trace cattle transfers between ranches, going further has proven impossible. 
JBS, Minerva and Marfrig, publicly traded companies with operations in dozens of countries, all told Reuters they recognize the problem with so-called ""indirect suppliers"" and that the industry and regulators must work together to solve it. 
Just before Bolsonaro was elected in 2018, Brazil's government drafted a voluntary agreement with major meatpackers and retailers to develop a tighter monitoring mechanism. The plan, previously unreported and recently reviewed by Reuters, would have used an existing system of livestock transport permits to track cattle movement. 
""The Environment Ministry commits to developing a computerized system to verify the origin of cattle and the preservation of native vegetation,"" the draft said.
But the Environment Ministry shelved the project after Bolsonaro won, according to three people familiar with the decision. ""It could have really made a difference,"" said Juliana Simoes, one of the people and a former ministry official who led the effort. 
The ministry declined to answer questions from Reuters about the aborted agreement, saying only that it ""supports the concept of traceability in agriculture."" 
""LAND WITHOUT MEN""
For most of its history, the Amazon was considered a ""green hell,"" dense and inhospitable for almost anyone besides the indigenous peoples already living there. Save for isolated settlements along the region's many rivers, colonists and Brazil's early governments pursued little development.
In the 1970s, Brazil's military dictatorship decided to build roads and promote migration, through cheap loans for land, to the Amazon. ""Land without men,"" the government slogan went, ""for men without land."" 
Costa, now 55 years old, first came when his father, a rancher like Costa's grandfather, took a government loan for a parcel in the Amazonian state of Para. At first, the family continued living in southern Brazil, traveling occasionally to Para, where a young Costa watched his father clear jungle with hired hands and chainsaws. 
At 17, Costa moved to Para for good, working for a while on his father's ranch and later taking jobs at other ranches and a nearby slaughterhouse. Paragominas, the sawmill town nearby, was so violent it came to be known as ""Paragobala"" – ""Paragobullet."" The farm had no electricity, the roads and surrounding woodland dangerous. 
""I cried nearly every day,"" he recalls.
Soon enough, he met a fellow rancher's daughter. They fell in love, married and started a family. 
Millions more Brazilians migrated to the Amazon. Wildcatters and squatters seized land without titles, forging deeds and other permits that still make the region a bramble of land conflicts and legal uncertainty. By the late 1980s, Amazon deforestation had become a signature issue of the modern-day environmentalist movement.
All around, Costa saw waste. 
After loggers fell valuable timber, ranchers follow, plant grass and put cattle to pasture. Without the native flora, the once-rich soil dries quickly and loses nutrients. So ranchers move on. 
""People just cut down more trees,"" Costa said, driving past abandoned pastures near Paragominas. Deeper into the forest, he pulled near a large truck, with no license plate, stacked high with freshly cut hardwood. ""All illegal,"" he said.
At present, about 70% of the deforested land in the Amazon is used for cattle, according to estimates by Daniel Nepstad, a veteran ecologist of the region. The nine states that form the Brazilian Amazon account for 40% of the country's herd. Para, a state larger than Texas and California combined, by itself accounts for about 10% of Brazil's cattle. 
Costa's zeal for conservation came not from a love of nature, but of numbers. He keeps a large Casio calculator in his ranch office and punctuates his conversation with clicks on its keys. 
In 1997, he struck out on his own, determined to find methods to avoid the wastefulness of slash-and-burn ranching. For about $190,000, he and a partner bought the land he currently ranches, near the Para town of Tailandia. A previous owner had cleared about 7% of the total plot of about 4,300 hectares, but it lay idle.
Costa planted new grasses. He fertilized the pastures and rotated cattle on a grazing schedule to optimize feeding times and grass growth. ""Even a few hours can make a difference,"" he said.
He currently farms about 500 hectares, roughly the size of 700 professional soccer fields. Because of a perverse irony of Amazon real estate, Costa actually leaves money on the table by not clearing the remaining 80% of his land. 
Despite the ecological wealth that woodland represents, cleared land sells for multiples what virgin rainforest does because farmers find it more useful. The dynamic discourages conservation, incentivizing destruction even if fields aren't ranched.
""Even my father-in-law thought I should cut more trees,"" Costa said. ""Forest doesn't create value."" 
When leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva became president in 2003, he sought to tackle deforestation. His government created nature reserves, better tracked logging and forest fires, and eventually blocked financing for farmers and ranchers caught working illegally cleared land. By the time Lula finished his second term, the annual rate of deforestation had plummeted almost 75%. 
Costa, meanwhile, further improved his grazing practices. He took soil samples, analyzed land chemistry and increased the number of cattle that could graze each hectare he ranches. He also received threats, he said, from people scorning his decision to leave so much forest intact. 
""I suffered a lot of bullying,"" he said. ""If you don't use it, someone else will,"" anonymous callers warned, a threat not easily dismissed in a region rife with squatters and murderous land disputes.
Still, his methods paid off. 
Costa now ranches nearly four times as many head per hectare than the average in Brazil, according to government statistics. By that metric, if other ranchers in the Amazon became as efficient, an area the size of France could be reforested on land today grazed by cattle. 
Seeking the secrets of his success, such as the seven different grasses he now grows, fellow ranchers visit Costa often, eager for a peek in the neat black ledger he carries. ""He's the best there is,"" said Jordan Timo, a fellow rancher and the consultant Costa asked to help him track suppliers. 
""PREACHING IN THE DESERT""
Brazil's gains against deforestation early this century were shortlived. 
A global commodities boom a decade ago fueled greater demand for beef and soy. Former President Dilma Rousseff, Lula's successor, sought to leverage the commodities bonanza to revive big infrastructure projects in the region. She relaxed regulations on nature reserves and pursued major hydroelectric projects on Amazon tributaries.
By 2015, the boom fizzled, draining government revenues. Rousseff and her successor, Michel Temer, cut financing and stripped powers from Ibama, Brazil's environmental agency. State and municipal authorities, squeezed by budget shortfalls of their own, struggled to fund law enforcement vital for monitoring destruction locally.
Deforestation rebounded. 
After early success tracking supply, the 2009 agreement with meatpackers to better monitor ranches yielded less progress than hoped for. JBS, Minerva and Marfrig say they continue to monitor the land of their immediate suppliers. But they remain unable to track where those vendors get the animals. Smaller meatpackers, meanwhile, never signed the agreement. 
Prosecutors in charge of environmental enforcement say any further crackdown, tracing beef throughout the industry, would in essence halt Brazil's cattle business. ""You would destroy the meatpacking industry,"" said Ricardo Negrini, a federal prosecutor in Belem, Para's capital. ""It has to be done gradually.""
Holly Gibbs, a geographer at the University of Wisconsin who has investigated land use by Brazil's beef industry, said only about 3% of cattle in Para and nearby states spend life on just one farm. 
Ranchers have all manner of tricks to get around controls, like splitting their tracts into separate titles, enabling them to graze cattle on illegally cleared pastures but then sell those animals from seemingly legitimate land.
The industry is so opaque that even ranchers sanctioned for deforestation sell their cattle easily. Moises Berta, who ranches near the frontier town of Novo Progresso, was fined by Ibama in 2016 for illegally cleared land. He admits he cleared the tract, but said he had no other choice to make a living.
The fine means his farm shows up on lists used by major meatpackers to block vendors. Berta said he has no trouble, however, getting his beef to market via middlemen or smaller slaughterhouses. On the downside, he said, these buyers pay about 20% less than the majors. ""It's a difficult situation,"" the 61-year-old told Reuters.
There are over 37,000 parcels in Amazon states that have been sanctioned by Ibama for environmental crimes. Fines are meant to blacklist areas for commercial use until owners replant cleared forest. In practice they do little more than force ranchers like Berta underground. 
For the methodical Costa, the preponderance of illegal ranching thwarted his effort to ensure a clean supply. 
About a third of his cattle, he calculated, came from land that has been sanctioned. Another 15% came from ranches with deeds and other paperwork that don't jibe with public registries, making it impossible for Costa to check their land against embargo lists.
The math in his black ledger spoke clearly. 
To recoup his investments in priming his pastures, Costa needs to boost his herd count from about 1,700 to 2,500 cattle each year just as the rainy season begins, usually in mid-December. The timing matters because that's when cattle can take advantage of the sudden acceleration in grass growth brought by the rain. 
If the herd is too small, some of the grass goes to waste. If he misses the window, Costa must spend yet more to buy feed. If Costa blocked cattle suppliers he knew or suspected had illegally cleared land, he realized, his herd wouldn't reach the critical mass necessary for ""as aguas,"" as the rains are called. 
Instead of his usual profit of roughly $85 per animal, Costa would have suffered a loss of about $50 per head. ""It just wasn't going to work,"" he explained. 
He abandoned the effort. 

As a result, Costa himself plays an indirect role in perpetuating at least some of the illegality. He feels tethered, he said, with few options to change a system that keeps him from ranching the way he believes he should. ""I feel like I'm preaching in the desert.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Gearing up for a key election next year, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has wielded corruption as both a stick with which to beat political adversaries, and a lightning rod to deflect criticism from his record in office.
Now, videos of his brother receiving cash from a political ally have cast doubt over Lopez Obrador's upright image, undermining his argument that entrenched corruption has fed chronic gang violence and held back Mexico's misfiring economy.
The coronavirus pandemic has plunged Mexico into its worst slump since the Great Depression, and the road to recovery looks long and hard with the central bank forecasting gross domestic product (GDP) could shrink by almost 13% this year.
Firing up his base ahead of congressional elections next June by raking through allegations of graft by Mexico's past leaders, Lopez Obrador has proposed twinning the vote with a referendum on whether to allow ex-presidents to be impeached.
""These are the two competing narratives: corruption versus economic crisis,"" said Francisco Abundis, head of Mexican polling firm Parametria. ""I think this is going to be what takes us into 2021. And I'm not sure which one will prevail.""
If Lopez Obrador loses the lower house of Congress, he may struggle to roll back the opening of the oil and gas market enacted by his predecessor, which he argues was mired in graft.
To fend off that risk, he is using the trial of Emilio Lozoya, a former boss of state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) charged with bribery and money laundering, to air allegations against former presidents and their business allies.
Polls suggest voters want to see past leaders face justice for what Lopez Obrador casts as decades of rigging the economy in favor of private interests at the expense of the people.
The crusade against corruption has buttressed his approval ratings, which, while down from the peaks of his first few months, remain well above 50% in most polls.
'HYPOCRISY'
Nevertheless, his carefully cultivated persona as a scourge of corruption suffered a blow last week with the publication of videos from 2015 showing one of his brothers receiving cash from a man who later served in Lopez Obrador's government.
Though he ordered the two to be investigated, Lopez Obrador described the video leaks as an act of revenge by adversaries angered by his efforts to clean up government.
Portraying the cash as grass-roots donations to his cause of social transformation, Lopez Obrador said the incident was incomparable to the scale of corruption he was tackling.
That explanation was not good enough for Adrian Gonzalez, a Mexico City lawyer who said he felt ""betrayed"" after voting for Lopez Obrador in 2018 and would not be doing so again.
""It's hypocrisy,"" the 34-year-old said. ""If you're going to tackle corruption, you need to set an example.""
Although it is gaining in importance, graft is not even the main worry of many voters. A Parametria poll in late July said 43% of respondents saw the economy as Mexico's biggest problem, versus 16% who chose corruption.
Lopez Obrador's threats to tear up business contracts awarded by past governments have helped to crimp investment from companies that could lift the economy, contributing to a recession even before the pandemic began.
Opposition politicians are pitching themselves as a more modern alternative to Lopez Obrador's economic agenda, which has sought to reassert state control of key areas like energy.
Ildefonso Guajardo, a former economy minister aiming to become governor of the northern state of Nuevo Leon next year, urged local authorities to take the lead on business development because they could no longer rely on the same federal support.

""You've got to make use of all you can at state level to stop this precipitous economic decline,"" said Guajardo, who led Mexico's renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement under the previous government.

They had painted the word ""lies"" in large green letters on the glass front doors of the building as other protesters held up a banner.
""Officers attended and two women aged 33 and 47 were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. Both remain in custody,"" a police spokesman said.
Extinction Rebellion, whose protests brought parts of London and other cities to a halt last year, has said it is restarting mass demonstrations this week having paused them earlier in the year due to the coronavirus.
